About CORPUS exploration and analysis:

To allow independent replication and verification of our study, the accompanying online repository is publicly available,
includes the Python scripts we developed for data exploration and analysis.

Step to execute scripts:

1: Download a zip file from Github
2: You may need to install matplotlib in python or you can use Google Colab Notebooks (https://colab.research.google.com/).
2: Customize the path of the CORPUS folder to read a CSV file (line of code 9 ->  data = pd.read_csv('CORPUS-Final.csv'))
3: Run a python script to get all the resultats of vertical and orthogonal analysis.
