About CORPUS exploration and analysis:

To allow independent replication and verification of our study, the accompanying online repository is publicly available,
includes the Python scripts we developed for data exploration and analysis.

Setup and run:

1: Download script.zip file a zip from Github
2: Create script folder anywhere on your PC and extract zip content to this folder
3: You may need to install matplotlib in Python 3.6 or, also you can use Google Colab Notebooks (https://colab.research.google.com/).
4: Customize the path of the CORPUS folder to read a CSV file (line of code 9 ->  data = pd.read_csv('CORPUS-Final.csv'))
5: Run a python script to get all the resultats of vertical and orthogonal analysis.
