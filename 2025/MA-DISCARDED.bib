  abstract     = {General circulation models (GCM) show projections of climate variables that when downscaled can be applied to analyse future behaviour in different areas or places. Using them is possible not just to obtain expected values of climate variables but also to calculate their distributions and use those values to assess the effects of climate change at a local level. However, these calculations depend on the GCM selected. In this paper, daily maximum near-surface air temperatures from 21 climate models under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 and historic daily maximum temperatures (1990–2019) from nine cities in southern Spain are used with two objectives: first, to investigate past behaviour broken down into a deterministic part and a stochastic part; second, to compare historical data (2006–2019) with the information extracted from the 21 GCMs based on calculating goodness of fit in the period for both deterministic and stochastic parts. The methodology proposed may be useful in selecting a model or a range of models for use in a specific study. The results show positive historical and future trends in maximum daily temperature for these cities. The GCMs with the best fit for each city in this specific case are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Internet of thing (IoT) application is an environment that interconnects the real world with the digital world using smart devices (sensors and actuators). Modeling IoT applications has become a requirement; many researchers are interested in integrating business processes into the design of IoT applications. The BPMN 2.0 standard is the most popular standard to model business processes. In this paper, we propose an extension of BPMN 2.0 to model IoT applications and a transformation from the extended BPMN2.0 diagrams to equivalent Maude specifications for the analysis purpose. This approach is based on the metamodeling of the BPMN diagram for IoT applications using Eclipse Modeling Framework and Acceleo language to automate code Maude generation. Our approach is illustrated with an example.},

Therefore, it is crucial to examine how these changes in climate and LULC will impact future hydrological responses, especially considering the growing water demand and agricultural activities. In this study, we first investigated the future climatic conditions of the Minab River Basin, Iran, by considering three CMIP6 scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios) from the CanESM5 model during 2021–2050 and 2051–2080. Next, the LULC maps of the watershed during 2035 and 2065 were projected, and the individual and combined impacts of LULC and climate on streamflow and evapotranspiration (ET) of the basin were evaluated using the SWAT model. The future precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature of the region were projected to increase up to 88},

  abstract     = {The deteriorating air quality in urban areas, particularly in developing countries, has led to increased attention being paid to the issue. Daily reports of air pollution are essential to effectively manage public health risks. Pollution estimation has become crucial to expanding spatial and temporal coverage and estimating pollution levels at different locations. The emergence of low-cost sensors has enabled high-resolution data collection, either in fixed or mobile settings, and various approaches have been proposed to estimate air pollution using this technology. The objective of this study is to enhance the data from fixed stations by incorporating opportunistic mobile monitoring (OMM) data. The main research question we are dealing with is: How can we augment fixed station data through OMM? In order to address the challenge of limited OMM data availability, we leverage existing data collected during periods when the pollution maps align with those observed by the fixed stations. By combining the fixed and mobile data, we apply interpolation techniques to produce more accurate pollution maps. The efficacy of our approach is validated through experiments conducted on a real-life dataset.},

  abstract     = {Image processing is an important area to bring out the best in an image for human interpretation. This process has been widely used in various fields such as machine vision, remote sensing image analysis, medical diagnosis, image restoration, image pattern recognition, and video processing. During the acquisition and transmission of digital images, several random signals, known as noise, can affect image quality. To reduce or to remove efficiently the noise in the acquired or transmitted images, various image denoising techniques can be applied. The performance of denoising methods increases progressively when the noise parameters are taken into account as input parameters. Traditional denoising approaches adopt some assumptions to model noise, such noise is known as purely additive or multiplicative, pixel-independent, and channel-invariant. Usually, these assumptions limit the denoising effect due to inaccurate estimation of noise parameters in these algorithm models. However, the real noise model is signal-dependent and even device-dependent. In this paper, a new denoising method called signal-dependant noise-reducing anisotropic diffusion is developed, which is a version of the speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter. It differs from the standard SRAD filter approach by the insertion of a suitable noise parameters estimation framework. The new filter is designed to handle a variety of images corrupted by several common types of signal-dependent noises that are produced by charge-coupled device sensors. As well as it offers great potential for denoising with preserving textures and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant increase in the image denoising performance in terms of SNR and RMSE. Qualitative (visual) results underline the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for filtering mixed signal-dependent noise.},

  abstract     = {Model-based testing (MBT) is a method that supports the design and execution of test cases by models that specify the intended behaviors of a system under test. While systematic literature reviews on MBT in general exist, the state of the art on modeling and testing performance requirements has seen much less attention. Therefore, we conducted a systematic mapping study on model-based performance testing. Then, we studied natural language software requirements specifications in order to understand which and how performance requirements are typically specified. Since none of the identified MBT techniques supported a major benefit of modeling, namely identifying faults in requirements specifications, we developed the Performance Requirements verificatiOn and Test EnvironmentS generaTion approach (PRO-TEST). Finally, we evaluated PRO-TEST on 149 requirements specifications. We found and analyzed 57 primary studies from the systematic mapping study and extracted 50 performance requirements models. However, those models don’t achieve the goals of MBT, which are validating requirements, ensuring their testability, and generating the minimum required test cases. We analyzed 77 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, extracted 149 performance requirements from those SRS, and illustrate that with PRO-TEST we can model performance requirements, find issues in those requirements and detect missing ones. We detected three not-quantifiable requirements, 43 not-quantified requirements, and 180 underspecified parameters in the 149 modeled performance requirements. Furthermore, we generated 96 test environments from those models. By modeling performance requirements with PRO-TEST, we can identify issues in the requirements related to their ambiguity, measurability, and completeness. Additionally, it allows to generate parameters for test environments.},

Within the post-earthquake environment, SRR models are useful for estimating seismic demands in uninstrumented buildings using the response measurements from those that are equipped with strong motion sensors. This paper introduces a dual model that uses kriging combined with the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to reconstruct seismic response demands in buildings during real earthquakes. The model is constructed with data that consists of responses from 207 buildings and 35 earthquakes. Kriging is first used to predict peak ground accelerations (PGAs) at the location of the uninstrumented buildings, using the measured PGAs from instrumented building sites with similar features (e.g., event magnitude, source-to-site distance, and location). The XGBoost algorithm is then used, with PGA as one of several features, to reconstruct the maximum (over the building height) peak (over the response history) story drift ratio and peak floor acceleration in the uninstrumented buildings. The residuals are then examined to assess overall model performance.},

As a result, researchers have conducted numerous experimental and numerical studies on solar technologies, with an increasing emphasis on the utilization of CFD for simulation purposes. Hence, this article is intended to be the first of a two-part assessment of recent improvements in the use of ANSYS-Fluent CFD simulation in solar systems. In this part, the article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CFD simulations, using ANSYS-Fluent, for different solar systems without concentrators, including solar thermal systems, hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems, and photovoltaic/phase change material (PV/PCM) systems, while the concentrating solar systems are covered in the second part. Further, this review study includes informative data about the simulations, including the considered assumptions, models, and solution methods that were used with different cooling fluids, PCM materials, absorber designs, and innovative system designs. The present assessment also highlights the results and some remarks that show different important additional information such as the applied radiation and melting/solidification models. Besides, validation techniques and errors between the experimental work and simulations are introduced. In general, the ANSYS-Fluent CFD results were validated and it was possible to optimize many design parameters with minimal effort and expense. Recent research indicated that nanofluids could be a better alternative to conventional fluids to improve the thermal functionality of flat plate and hybrid PV/T systems. Effective cooling mechanisms could reduce PV panel temperature by 15–20},

This paper aims to realise the integrated design of such systems by introducing a framework that incorporates Systems Engineering and Object-Oriented methods to develop a model that holistically embodies design knowledge of such systems. This model is constructed in Finite-State-Machine formalism to achieve an executable architecture and integrated with optimization models to allow simulation of alternatives and to observe the impact of design decisions on system behaviour. Supportive algorithms are introduced for refinements of design alternatives according to the simulation results. A fuzzy assessment approach is introduced to also assess the alternatives against qualitative criteria. The framework integrates simulation and fuzzy assessment results and performs a multi-criteria assessment to select an alternative for the detailed design. Therefore, the framework can stand as a decision support framework at early design stages, giving insights to designers about the impact of single design decisions on system overall performance and satisfaction of various objectives.},

  abstract     = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) consist of bio-sensor nodes that can be either wearable or implantable in the human body. These sensors play a crucial role in monitoring patients’ conditions both inside and outside hospitals. However, the sensor nodes in WBANs have limitations in energy, memory, temperature tolerance, and computational capability. Consequently, designing an efficient routing protocol for WBANs presents a significant challenge. It is essential to develop a routing protocol that effectively addresses these limitations. In recent years, many routing techniques have been proposed for WBANs; however, they have not adequately addressed critical aspects such as energy efficiency, stability, traffic load balancing, and temperature control in sensor nodes. To address these issues, this paper proposes an energy-efficient and thermal-aware routing protocol (SETA) based on an improved ant colony optimization algorithm for multi-WBAN environments. The SETA protocol employs a multi-effective cost function to select optimal forwarder nodes for constructing routes between the source sensor nodes and the sink node. Additionally, the proposed scheme introduces a new mechanism to dynamically change forwarder nodes after transmitting a certain number of data packets. This mechanism helps balance energy consumption and traffic load among nodes while preventing the forwarding of data packets from hotspot nodes. Furthermore, the SETA routing scheme considers both single-hop and multi-hop communication based on the state of the sensor nodes and the priority of the data that needs to be sent to the sink node. The findings indicate that the proposed SETA protocol achieves significantly better improvement rates in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, average end-to-end delay, energy consumption, convergence time, network lifetime, and temperature overhead compared to the existing PLQE, AMCRP, and THAT routing protocols.},

Scenarios based on expert-judgment methods commonly lack assigned probabilities, making it difficult to assess their plausibility. Our option-based approach complements existing methods based on historical distributions or expert judgment and provides a tool for evaluating the plausibility of hypothetical shocks that are more severe than the historical experience.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel spatiotemporal nonlocal elasticity model based on the Klein–Gordon-type theory to investigate size- and time-dependent mechanical and thermal behaviors in perfectly conducting isotropic micropolar thermoelastic materials at micro- and nanoscales. The proposed model integrates internal length and time scales to account for nonlocal interactions and long-range forces, which are essential for accurately describing material behavior at reduced scales where classical continuum theories fail. This framework is seamlessly coupled with the dual-phase-lag (DPL) generalized thermoelasticity to capture finite-speed heat propagation, overcoming the limitations of Fourier’s law. To analyze the coupled thermoelastic responses, we apply the normal mode analysis technique, which allows for the derivation of exact analytical solutions for critical field variables—including temperature, displacement, microrotation, thermal stresses, and carrier density —under arbitrary loading conditions in a two-dimensional half-space domain. The governing equations incorporate micropolar effects, magneto-thermoelastic coupling, and nonlocal constitutive relations, providing a comprehensive description of the system's dynamic behavior. Numerical simulations are performed for a hypothetical magnesium crystal-like material, chosen for its relevance in advanced engineering applications. The results reveal that the inclusion of micropolarity, DPL phase lags, and spatiotemporal nonlocal parameters significantly enhances the accuracy of predicted thermal and mechanical responses, yielding smoother and more damped profiles compared to classical and generalized thermoelasticity models. Graphical representations illustrate finite-speed wave propagation, nonlocal effects, and the influence of phase lag parameters, emphasizing the model's applicability in nanotechnology, microelectronics, and advanced composite design. The present work not only advances the theoretical understanding of micropolar magneto-thermoelasticity but also provides a robust modeling framework for predicting the behavior of micro- and nano-scale systems under complex thermal and magnetic environments. This enhanced predictive capability is crucial for the design and optimization of high-performance materials and devices operating at small scales.},

  abstract     = {Soil erosion by water is a serious problem in Ethiopia, contributing to diminishing crop yields and food shortages. Apart from understanding the magnitude, risk, and spatial distribution of the problem, identifying erosion hotspot areas is essential for effectively reversing the problem. This study aims to identify erosion hotspots in the Gotu watershed, in northeastern Ethiopia, using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and incorporating local farmers’ perspectives to prioritize conservation efforts. The RUSLE model reveals that 29,744.3 metric tons of soil is lost annually from the Gotu watershed, with an average loss of 65.3 to t ha⁻^1 year⁻^1. The main contributing factors to soil erosion in the watershed include undulating topography, loss of plant cover, and continuous cultivation. The highest soil loss rates (> 80 t ha⁻^1 year⁻^1) were found in the western, northern, and southern parts of the watershed, where cultivation occurs on moderate to steep slopes with sparse vegetation cover. These areas should be prioritized for conservation interventions. Farmers identified poor crop yields and damaged conservation structures as key indicators of soil erosion prevalence in the watershed. Increasing farmer’s understanding of soil erosion and the importance of soil and water conservation is essential for effectively controlling soil erosion and improving food security in the area.},

Usually, databases and other structured sources for AMES mutagenicity exist, which have been carefully and laboriously curated from scientific publications. As knowledge accumulates over time, updating these databases is always an overhead and impractical. In this paper, we first propose the problem of predicting the mutagenicity of chemicals from textual information in scientific publications. More simply, given a chemical and evidence in the natural language form from publications where the mutagenicity of the chemical is described, the goal of the model/algorithm is to predict if it is potentially mutagenic or not. For this, we first construct a golden standard data set and then propose MutaPredBERT , a prediction model fine-tuned on B i o L i n k B E R T based on a question-answering formulation of the problem. We leverage transfer learning and use the help of large transformer-based models to achieve a Macro F1 score of >0.88 even with relatively small data for fine-tuning.

However, guaranteeing the safety assurance of the IoT system is increasingly becoming a concern. While the growing complexity of IoT design has brought additional safety requirements, developing safe systems remains a critical design objective. In earlier studies, a limited number of approaches have been proposed to evaluate the safety requirements of IoT systems through the generation of static safety artefacts based on manual processes. This paper proposes a model-based approach to the safety analysis of the IoT system. The proposed framework explores the expressiveness of UML/SysML graphical modelling languages to develop a dynamic fault tree (DFT) as an analysis artefact of the IoT system. The framework was validated using a hypothetical IoT-enabled Smart Fire Detection and Prevention System (SFDS). The novel framework can capture dynamic failure behaviour, often ignored in most model-based approaches. This effort complements the inherent limitations of existing manual static failure analysis of the IoT systems, and consequently, facilitates a viable safety analysis that increases public assurance in the IoT systems.},

Analyzing this data with Big Data techniques provides insights for improving traffic management, reducing congestion, and enhancing public transport efficiency. The study evaluates the impact of these technologies on optimizing urban mobility and their contribution to city sustainability. IoT technology facilitates intelligent transportation systems that adapt dynamically to traffic conditions, adjust traffic light timings, and suggest alternative routes during congestion. Real-time monitoring of vehicle and pedestrian flow allows authorities to make informed, proactive decisions to improve mobility. Big Data analysis identifies patterns and trends in mobility behaviors, aiding in future transport infrastructure planning and optimizing existing routes. This synergy between IoT and Big Data not only boosts operational efficiency but also promotes urban sustainability by reducing carbon emissions through efficient traffic management.

This risk is particularly elevated at the end of the useful life of ENM. Given the lack of regulations targeting the safe disposal of ENM at end-of-life, nanowaste (NW) currently follows conventional waste management pathways even though their potential adverse effects on humans and the natural environment are well documented in the literature. Presently, preference exists for treating NW via centralized waste-to-energy systems such as incineration, given the potentially hazardous nature of NW. In this work, a Design of experiment (DOE) methodology—Box Behnken design was employed to optimize three independent operating parameters of a pilot-scale scrubber concerning the collection of nanoparticles under waste incineration conditions. The pilot-scale scrubber was designed and operated to be representative of a full-scale spray scrubber found in a hazardous waste incineration plant. The independent parameters studied are; the gas flowrate, the liquid flowrate and the droplet diameter. Six responses were chosen corresponding to the nanoparticle collection efficiencies at particle sizes in the diffusion-dominant, intermediate and impaction-dominant regions. The experimental results were analyzed for statistical significance using Design Expert software (V13). The DOE model by the software was then used to predict optimum operating conditions with maximum nanoparticle collection. A maximum nanoparticle collection efficiency of 41–60},

  abstract     = {A microservice architecture has become the dominant direction for designing the building blocks of large-scale, distributed software systems. However, the dynamic and changing microservices within decentralized systems in contrast to available static tracing tools presents challenges for comprehending its impact on the overall architecture. Existing tracing tools uncover service call graphs but have limitations in visualizing historical changes; moreover, they are not meant to aid with architecture assessment where developers seek potential design anomalies. With the ever-growing system complexity, developers likely resort to focusing on specific subsets of the system, especially given the lack of tools to analyze the impacts of system evolution. To address these challenges, we introduce the MicroProspect tool that provides a high-level, holistic visual perspective on the system’s service view, tracks its structural changes throughout system evolution, and detects and visualizes anti-patterns that could lead to architectural degradation.},

  abstract     = {The new kinetically limited linear driving force (KLLDF) model was assessed against the traditional LDF model in the prediction of twelve different ternary and quaternary experimental breakthrough curves. These breakthrough curves comprised mixtures of CO_2, N_2 and CH_4 in He adsorbed on carbon molecular sieve MSC 3 K 172 and were conducted at various pressures (30, 50 and 100 psia) and at ambient temperature. The LDF and KLLDF models were implemented in the dynamic adsorption process simulator (DAPS) with the loading dependent LDF mass transfer coefficients and the single gas equilibrium adsorption isotherms measured independently with gravimetric uptake experiments. To make the comparison between the LDF and the KLLDF models as fair as possible, they utilized the same set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters in DAPS, with no adjustments to any of them. Both the LDF and KLLDF models provided reasonable predictions of the experimental breakthrough curves and in-bed temperature histories, with general trends of no CH_4 uptake, gradual N_2 uptake and fast CO_2 uptake. However, the KLLDF model always provided better predictions, especially when CO_2 was present. The results revealed that the traditional LDF model led to depressed adsorbed phase loadings of CO_2, thereby underpredicting its breakthrough time in all cases. This depression stemmed from the equilibrium loading in the LDF driving force of the LDF model depending on the gas phase partial pressure of each component outside the pore structure. In contrast, the KLLDF model corrects this issue by making the equilibrium loading in its LDF driving force dependent on the actual loading of each component inside the pore structure. In conjunction with the mixed gas extended Langmuir model, the KLLDF model is perhaps the more appropriate model to use instead of the LDF model for any multicomponent adsorbate-adsorbent systems, whether diffusion limited or not, since it reduces to the LDF model for systems that do not exhibit significant diffusional limitations.},

Global Software Engineering (GSE) represents a recognized practice that facilitates the collaborative development of software artifacts across geographically distributed teams. In this context, the successful design and maintenance of software requires continuous collaboration to manage critical architectural decisions effectively. Consequently, various tools for Architecture Design Decision (ADD) have been developed to support design thinking and the decision-making process. However, recent research studies have drawn attention to challenges in managing ADDs within distributed environments. Aim. Our study aims to determine assessment metrics to evaluate if the existing ADD tools support Distributed Collaborative Design (DCD) in the GSE setting. Method. We used a Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) method and conducted expert surveys to define and validate the assessment metrics. Result. We present six assessment metrics for evaluating the support of ADD tools in facilitating distributed collaborative design (DCD). Conclusion. The assessment metrics provide a tool analysis to extract insights into current practice within an ADD process in distributed development environments.},

  abstract     = {This study seeks to explore two new km-scale regional climate simulations prepared through the European Climate Prediction project over the Madeira and Canary islands, which are Portuguese and Spanish archipelagos located in the North Atlantic, off the African coast. The simulations are based on two models using different modelling approaches: COSMO-CLM with a three-step nesting at 50, 25 and 3 km grid spacing using a time-slice approach driven by a global climate model, and COSMO-crCLIM with a two-step nesting at 12 and 1 km grid spacing using the pseudo-global warming approach, where the current-day simulations are driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. Although the modelling approaches are different, several findings are highlighted: (1) the use of km-scale simulation is essential to properly represent temperature and precipitation mean and extremes over small islands that are characterized by complex topography; (2) the projected changes in temperature and precipitation mean and extremes are qualitatively similar in all seasons except autumn; (3) the differences in the autumn projections are shown to be due to the large-scale driving conditions. Small islands, such as the Canary and Madeira ones, are often neglected by large modelling initiatives, so the presented simulations contribute to filling this gap for local policy makers, stakeholders and climate services. The encouraging results highlight the need for further coordinated km-scale projections.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising is an important preprocessing step in low-level vision problems involving biomedical images. Noise removal techniques can greatly benefit raw corrupted magnetic resonance images (MRI). It has been discovered that the MR data is corrupted by a mixture of Gaussian-impulse noise caused by detector flaws and transmission errors. This paper proposes a deep generative model ( GenMRIDenoiser ) for dealing with this mixed noise scenario. This work makes four contributions. To begin, Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is used in model training to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradient, mode collapse, and convergence issues encountered while training a vanilla GAN. Second , a perceptually motivated loss function is used to guide the training process in order to preserve the low-level details in the form of high-frequency components in the image. Third , batch renormalization is used between the convolutional and activation layers to prevent performance degradation under the assumption of non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data. Fourth , global feature attention module (GFAM) is appended at the beginning and end of the parallel ensemble blocks to capture the long-range dependencies that are often lost due to the small receptive field of convolutional filters. The experimental results over synthetic data and MRI stack obtained from real MR scanners indicate the potential utility of the proposed technique across a wide range of degradation scenarios.},

Relying on finite-state machines (FSMs) where transition labels look like Hoare triples, can specify the coordination of the participants of a distributed protocol for instance an execution model akin blockchain smart contracts (SCs). In fact, the transitions of our FSMs yield guards, and assignments over data variables, and with participants binders. The latter allow us to model scenarios with an unbounded number of participants which can vary at run-time. We introduce a notion of well-formedness to rule out meaningless or problematic specifications. This notion is verified with and demonstrated on several case studies borrowed from the smart contracts domain. Then, we evaluate the performance of using a set of randomised examples, studying the correlations between the features supported and the time taken to decide well-formedness.},

In such conditions, B cells may enter the CNS parenchyma and contribute to local tissue destruction. It remains unexplored, however, how infection and autoimmunity drive transcriptional phenotypes, repertoire features, and antibody functionality. Here, we profiled B cells from the CNS of murine models of intracranial (i.c.) viral infections and autoimmunity. We identified a population of clonally expanded, antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) that had undergone class-switch recombination and extensive somatic hypermutation following i.c. infection with attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV). Recombinant expression and characterisation of these antibodies revealed specificity to viral antigens (LCMV glycoprotein GP), correlating with ASC persistence in the brain weeks after resolved infection. Furthermore, these virus-specific ASCs upregulated proliferation and expansion programs in response to the conditional and transient induction of the LCMV GP as a neo-self antigen by astrocytes. This class-switched, clonally expanded, and mutated population persisted and was even more pronounced when peripheral B cells were depleted prior to autoantigen induction in the CNS. In contrast, the most expanded B cell clones in mice with persistent expression of LCMV GP in the CNS did not exhibit neo-self antigen specificity, potentially a consequence of local tolerance induction. Finally, a comparable population of clonally expanded, class-switched, and proliferating ASCs was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) patients. Taken together, our findings support the existence of B cells that populate the CNS and are capable of responding to locally encountered autoantigens.},

As a result, it has also been regarded as the ‘fuel of the future’ and global research is focused on identifying diverse H_2 sources and designing economically viable production processes. However, many challenges such as production optimization, storage, transport and cost associated with H_2 production make it a less viable option commercially. Despite the challenges, researchers globally are working toward developing new production and storage processes via the integration of the latest technological advancements. Thus, the present article discusses the emergence of H_2 as an efficient and clean energy source. The article also presents an insight into the types of H_2 ‘colors’ and highlights its ability to replace carbon-based petroleum refineries. The work also discusses H_2 production, storage, and distribution for its utilization in energy and industrial sectors. Further, the economic and life cycle assessment analyses of H_2 production processes provide insight into the different stages involved and how various tools can be used to design cost-effective production processes. The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous fields, and science is no exception. Thus, the current review also explores the potential of AI integration and optimization in H_2 production suggesting its potential role as a clean energy and sustainable energy source of the future.

  abstract     = {Swarm intelligence leverages collective behaviours emerging from interaction and activity of several “simple” agents to solve problems in various environments. One problem of interest in large swarms featuring a variety of sub-goals is swarm clustering , where the individuals of a swarm are assigned or choose to belong to zero or more groups, also called clusters . In this work, we address the sensing-based swarm clustering problem, where clusters are defined based on both the values sensed from the environment and the spatial distribution of the values and the agents. Moreover, we address it in a setting characterised by decentralisation of computation and interaction, and dynamicity of values and mobility of agents. For the solution, we propose to use the field-based computing paradigm, where computation and interaction are expressed in terms of a functional manipulation of fields , distributed and evolving data structures mapping each individual of the system to values over time. We devise a solution to sensing-based swarm clustering leveraging multiple concurrent field computations with limited domain and evaluate the approach experimentally by means of simulations, showing that the programmed swarms form clusters that well reflect the underlying environmental phenomena dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Chlorination by maintaining the injected chlorine concentration in the range between the minimum and maximum is among the most inexpensive and common disinfection methods in water distribution networks. The minimum concentration of residual chlorine must be observed to control the microbial quality of water. Besides, the maximum chlorine concentration must be observed to control problems related to water smell and taste and to prevent the production of toxic byproducts. This research has developed a model by combining the EPANET model and the ACO_R optimization algorithm to optimize the chlorine injection program during the operation period. According to the results, the ACOR algorithm could be used to derive a suitable program for chlorine injection in the water distribution network such that the permissible constraints of chlorine are observed in the consumption nodes of the network and the consumption of chlorine is reduced to the least level in the network. The developed model was applied to determine an optimal chlorine injection program in a classical example (the Branford network), which was also of interest to some previous researchers. Using the optimal injection program obtained by the model, the chlorine concentration was set at an acceptable network level between the permissible range of 0.2–0.8 g/l. This output was more favorable than the response of other methods in terms of the total residual chlorine concentration, which was 5.8},

Traditional discovered process models often lack sufficient contextual depth, limiting the interpretability and actionability of the revealed activity process flows. This paper addresses the challenge of balancing interpretability with complexity in discovered process models by introducing a new context-driven method, namely Contextualized Activity hieRarchies for Process dIscovery (CARPI). CARPI consists of a detailed five-step process to identify, extract, and integrate meaningful contextual variables into core activities flows in the process to enhance model clarity and decision-making support. We implement and validate this method using a real-world case study in manufacturing and the BPI Challenge 2017 dataset, demonstrating how the integration of relevant contextual variables refines process models to make activity flows more interpretable and actionable. This contribution advances the field of process mining by offering a clear and structured method to enrich process models with important context variables, laying the foundation for more insightful and effective business process management and improvement.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing is an emerging and promising computational paradigm that provides substantial speedup for a variety of tasks such as integer factorization, database search, and machine learning. One of the quantum computation features is the possibility of developing quantum algorithms, which could be faster than algorithms developed for classic computers. However, we are still unable to fully realize a physical quantum computer and depend on traditional computers to simulate their behavior and test quantum algorithms. This is a source of complexity since one of the challenges to simulate quantum algorithms is the exponential memory requirement. In this work, we propose a method to distribute the computation load of the simulation process between CPU and GPU to decrease the required memory and computation time. In this approach, we employ a hybrid platform, which simulates the quantum circuit in two phases using parallel array-based and recursive manners. The experimental results demonstrate speedups of 50 X over the recursive method implemented on a GPU and 2.9 X over the state vector method running on a multi-core CPU. Our approach is more than 10 X energy-efficient for simulating 39 qubits compared to the GPU state-of-the-art technique. All in all, this approach is able to simulate more qubits over state-of-the-art GPU approaches and can be used to analyze and simulate large quantum circuits with a low-cost system instead of an expensive supercomputer.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing holds great promise for accelerating computational tasks, but they are still not accessible. To fill this gap, quantum computing simulators have been widely used for the developing of quantum circuits and algorithms. Simulating quantum algorithms on classical computers also poses challenges due to the need for exponential memory and computational requirements. Many researchers attempted to address such challenges on different single-core, multi-core, and many-core systems, especially graphics processing units (GPUs). The diversity of CPU and GPU simulation of quantum circuits, including various CPU–GPU combinations and multiple parameters, including qubit size, memory capacity, circuit depth, GPU performance, resource heterogeneity, and load imbalance, makes it even more challenging. Finding the best configuration requires an exhaustive search in the design space, which is not possible in an acceptable time frame. Therefore, given the multitude of parameters and the analysis of influential factors, having an analytical model for selecting the proper configuration is desirable and even essential for large systems. This paper proposes a novel analytical performance model for quantum circuit simulation on a hybrid CPU–GPU platform of various sizes and parameters such as number of CPUs/GPUs, qubit size, memory capacity, quantum circuit depth, CPU/GPU performance, resource heterogeneity, and processing load. To do so, we focus on evaluating a scalable and adaptive hybrid quantum simulator in a hybrid platform with some CPUs and GPUs across multiple hosts. The model analyzes the execution time of individual GPU kernels and the impact of major micro-architecture features on performance. By employing dynamic load partitioning (DLP) and the heterogeneous multi-GPU kernel, performance bottlenecks are accurately identified, and execution time is estimated. The proposed model shows high accuracy, with a 94},

Quantum computing holds a significant advantage in its capacity to run quantum algorithms that surpass current classical computer algorithms. However, practical realization of quantum computers remains in its nascent stages, necessitating reliance on classical computation platforms for simulating quantum circuit behavior and developing quantum algorithms. Simulating quantum algorithms presents a formidable challenge due to exponential memory and computation resource demands. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to optimize computational workload distribution during simulation by leveraging Dynamic Load Partitioning (DLP) between host CPUs and GPUs, with the primary aim of reducing resource and computation time requirements. Our method employs a hybrid CPU-GPU platform that divides quantum circuit simulation into two sections, utilizing parallel vector and recursive methods. We conducted our experiments on a cluster of nodes with multiple GPUs to scale qubit simulation and achieve significant speedup over existing simulators. Specifically, our approach demonstrates a remarkable 96X speedup over recursive path-summing on a single GPU and 12.98X speedup over the latest implementation on a multi-node cluster system. Furthermore, our method exhibits energy efficiency, surpassing the state-of-the-art technique by a 55X improvement. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in leveraging low-cost systems for simulating and processing quantum circuits.},

However, studies have also shown that traceability practices are still not prevalent in industrial settings due to the high manual effort and lack of tool support. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using eye tracking to automatically detect trace links to reduce manual effort and thereby increase practical applicability. We conducted a two-stage interview study in industry. In Stage 1 we interviewed 20 practitioners to provide an overview of how traceability is established in practice and how an eye tracking approach would need to be applied in order to be useful. In Stage 2 we conducted interviews with 16 practitioners from one project context to elicit role-specific workflows and analyzed which activities are suitable to obtain useful traceability links based on gaze data. As there is no one-fits-all solution to traceability, and technical limitations of eye tracking still exist, we collected information on used artifact types, tools and requirements management practices to adjust an approach to actual traceability stakeholders’ needs. We report on perspectives from different roles in software projects and give an overview of traced artifacts, current traceability experiences, as well as benefits and doubts concerned with using eye tracking to obtain links automatically. We discuss the implications for the evaluation and implementation of an automatic tracing approach in practice and how eye tracking can support requirements engineering activities.},

  abstract     = {Geometric Asian options are a type of option where the payoff depends on the geometric mean of the underlying asset over a certain period of time. This paper is concerned with the pricing of such options for the class of Volterra-Heston models, covering the rough Heston model. We are able to derive semi-closed formulas for the prices of geometric Asian options with fixed and floating strikes for this class of stochastic volatility models. These formulas require the explicit calculation of the conditional joint Fourier transform of the logarithm of the stock price and the logarithm of the geometric mean of the stock price over time. Linking our problem to the theory of affine Volterra processes, we find a representation of this Fourier transform as a suitably constructed stochastic exponential, which depends on the solution of a Riccati-Volterra equation. Finally, we provide a numerical study for our results in the rough Heston model.},

  abstract     = {An important paradigm in industrial engineering for fault detection and diagnosis purposes is signal processing. The various methods consider methods in the time, frequency, or time–frequency domain for signal processing as state and output signals from the considered process. The objective of this work is to perform a comparative analysis of the most used methods based on a signal processing paradigm and in the context of fault detection and process diagnosis. The electromechanical equipment that generates mechanical vibrations—as an effect of bearing faults—is considered and analyzed. The recorded data are explored with smaller and sliding frames, adapted to the processing criteria used. Seven methods are considered for evaluation: two in the time domain, two in the frequency domain and three in the time–frequency domain. The main problem is to extract and select the right features to use in the classification stage. The methods of the time domain are based on statistical moments and signal modeling. The methods in the frequency domain use either the discrete components of power spectra or the features of the frequency domain. In the time–frequency domain, the coefficients of the time–frequency transforms define digital images, which are further processed. For testing, the methods are evaluated with real recorded data from bearings with several types and sizes of faults, i.e., incipient, medium, advanced, and large. Finally, the considered methods are compared from the point of view of five criteria, namely, the recognition rate, window length, response time, computational resources, and complexity of the algorithms. A global quality criterion is built and used to assess the quality of the methods. The results of the computer-based experiments show acceptable performance for all methods for the test case of bearings but the potential to detect more complex faults and change detection in the behavior of the machines, in general. Time–frequency methods offer an optimum. 1. A practical comparative overview of the main methods based on signal processing paradigm used in process diagnosis and detection problem. 2. Comparing methods from different domains of representations: time, frequency, and time-frequency domain. 3.

  abstract     = {Floods are the largest natural disaster currently facing the UK, whilst the incidents of droughts have increased in recent years. Floods and droughts can have devastating consequences on society, resulting in significant financial damage to the economy. Climate models suggest that precipitation and temperature changes will exacerbate future hydrological extremes (i.e., floods and droughts). Such events are likely to become more frequent and intense in the future; thus to develop adaptation plans climate model projections feed hydrological models to provide future water resource projections. ‘eFLaG’ is one set of future river flow projections produced for the UK driven by UKCP18 climate projections from the UK Met Office. The UKCP18-derived eFLaG dataset provides state-of-the-art projections for a single GCM driven by RCP 8.5 across the entire UK. A QE-ANOVA approach has been used to partition contributing sources of uncertainty for two flow quantiles (Q5 high flows and Q95 low flows), at near and far future time scales, for each of the 186 GB catchments in the eFLaG dataset. Results suggest a larger hydrological model uncertainty associated with low flows and greater regional climate model uncertainty for high flows which remains stationary between flow indicators. Total uncertainty increases from near to far future and highly uncertain catchments have been identified with a high concentration in South-East England.},

Digital Product Passports are also being developed and will become mandatory, such as for batteries in the European Union by 2027. Although this may initially require additional work, it can lead to synergies from the information obtained. By using 
$$\mathrm {CO_2~}$$
 CO 2 values, e.g., from a Digital Product Passport of components, you can optimize the 
$$\mathrm {CO_2~}$$
 CO 2 content of the end product to achieve a specific target and improve competitiveness. This can be achieved by adapting processes, such as choosing between high or low dynamics to influence overall energy consumption. A framework is necessary to extract specific information from DPP and make decisions for adaptation. This paper presents a framework architecture based on OPC UA and the AAS, accompanied by an illustrative example of a battery-packing handling process. The speed of the packing process is determined by the energy consumption values of the individual cells to reduce the total energy consumption value of the battery.},

  abstract     = {Nickel-based superalloys are crucial for high-temperature applications in power generation, aerospace, and chemical industries due to their superior mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. However, welding these alloys presents significant challenges, including complex microstructures, susceptibility to hot cracking, and intricate joint geometries, requiring precise control of welding parameters to ensure joint integrity. Traditional experimental methods are costly and time-consuming, making numerical simulations a vital alternative. The accuracy of these simulations depends on selecting appropriate heat source models, as incorrect models lead to flawed predictions of temperature distribution, thermal gradients, and residual stresses, ultimately affecting the performance and lifespan of welded components. This study reviews advancements in welding nickel-based superalloys, focusing on heat source models and finite element analysis (FEA), including Goldak’s double ellipsoidal, rotary Gaussian, and hybrid conical-cylindrical models. The transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in optimizing welding processes is also explored, highlighting improvements in productivity, material efficiency, and quality control. A patent landscape analysis provides insights into the evolving contributions of heat source models and AI to welding technologies. This research emphasizes enhancing weld reliability, reducing costs, and supporting sustainable manufacturing while laying the foundation for AI-driven adaptive welding systems in safety–critical applications.

This stems from unclear guidelines on how to conduct activities and engage users effectively to achieve their goals during the development process. This study explored how the integration of collaboration engineering (CE) principles with UCD approach could address these challenges. Using an Applied Science / Engineering approach, a UCD-CE process was designed drawing on the Six-layer model of Collaboration. This model aligns the CE steps with UCD principles (why), practices (what), and methods (how). Data collection tools included structured interviews, questionnaires, and observations, supported by techniques like user stories and dialogues, as well as thinkLets, and patterns of collaboration. Formative and summative evaluations were used to validate the UCD-CE process; and the results underscore its strengths, particularly its efficiency in helping users to complete tasks on time, reducing effort in reaching common goals, fostering high user satisfaction, promoting creativity and productivity, ensuring ease-of-use and learnability, and delivering comprehensive outcomes in requirements elicitation and analysis tasks during the development process.

  abstract     = {Glycans participate in a vast number of recognition systems in diverse organisms in health and in disease. However, glycans cannot be sequenced because there is no sequencer technology that can fully characterize them. There is no “template” for replicating glycans as there are for amino acids and nucleic acids. Instead, glycans are synthesized by a complicated orchestration of multitudes of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. Thus glycans can vary greatly in structure, but they are not genetically reproducible and are usually isolated in minute amounts. To characterize (sequence) the glycome (defined as the glycans in a particular organism, tissue, cell, or protein), glycosylation pathway prediction using in silico methods based on glycogene expression data, and glycosylation simulations have been attempted. Since many of the mammalian glycogenes have been identified and cloned, it has become possible to predict the glycan biosynthesis pathway in these systems. By then incorporating systems biology and bioprocessing technologies to these pathway models, given the right enzymatic parameters including enzyme and substrate concentrations and kinetic reaction parameters, it is possible to predict the potentially synthesized glycans in the pathway. This review presents information on the data resources that are currently available to enable in silico simulations of glycosylation and related pathways. Then some of the software tools that have been developed in the past to simulate and analyze glycosylation pathways will be described, followed by a summary and vision for the future developments and research directions in this area.

The study demonstrates that neglecting geological heterogeneity in the vertically-averaged relative permeability and pseudo-capillary pressure may lead to significant errors in predicted CO_2 plume extents. These errors result from unjustifiably assuming homogeneous-acting formations to highly heterogeneous formations. Their magnitudes depend on the heterogeneity level and the simulation timescale. We leverage existing simulators to run VE models and discuss their shortcomings. Our investigation highlights VE simulation as a promising tool for dedicated future development in the industry, particularly through automation of the proposed screening workflows for probabilistic prediction of CO_2 plume migration. We also propose treating VE models as metamodels (models of vertically-discretized models with infinite vertical resolution), particularly in contexts where geological data are limited. The study concludes with reporting a successful implementation of a sharp-interface VE simulation in a real, heterogeneous formation. While our conclusions are drawn specifically for geological CO_2 storage, they are applicable to other fluids in similar settings.},

Efficiently executing these kernels while taking into account variations in kernel execution time and heterogeneous processing unit speeds, is crucial for overall simulation performance. Ensuring that this execution strategy adapts automatically to the underlying hardware architecture is important to ensure performance portability. To address these challenges, this work introduces a method for efficiently distributing ionic model kernels across heterogeneous resources, guided by a resource dimensioning heuristic that adapts to each model’s computational profile. These mechanisms are integrated into openCARP and evaluated on 30 representative ionic models, with a focus on both performance and energy efficiency. We demonstrate that on a node with 8 GPUs, our method achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1.45 compared to using all GPUs, while also improving energy efficiency.},

  abstract     = {As software systems become increasingly complex, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering is gaining relevance. However, a critical gap exists in the understanding and interpretation of AI-driven decision-making processes, especially in areas intrinsically linked to human expertise, such as software modeling. This paper proposes an exploratory study on the feasibility, efficacy, and relevance of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques within this context. The application of machine learning (ML) to software models is relatively recent, so efforts such as the ModelSet dataset are crucial for deriving effective training data for ML models. In addition, predictive software modeling tasks present some unusual requirements, such as the need for multi-class and multi-label approaches that are not as commonly investigated from an XAI perspective. In fact, the adoption of XAI in software modeling has been barely explored and possibly requires adapted methodologies. Our approach encompasses an in-depth examination of explanations generated by five XAI techniques that evaluate feature contributions globally for ML models and locally for specific predictions. This could help software modelers understand, for example, why a model is classified in a particular domain. Additionally, our study includes a survey conducted among software modelers to capture how explanations support their decision-making, to evaluate the perceived level of agreement between different XAI techniques, and to identify current limitations. We argue that XAI can improve the transparency and trustworthiness of the decision-making process for software modelers, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of intricate modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {The use of mobile devices for web browsing has increased extraordinarily in recent years, becoming the main source of information. Unfortunately, developers cannot meet the needs of all users. As a result, users have been forced to adapt web content to their needs. Additionally, users face more costly interactions than on desktop computers due to the smaller screen size of cell phones. These interactions include URL typing, scrolling, taping, branching and tab-switching. If the number of web resources is large, the activity becomes unpleasant. Furthermore, should the quantity of interactions be extensive, the web experience also becomes unpleasant. Moreover, all these interactions lead to higher costs in terms of phone time and battery life, as well as more costly navigation. Web augmentation enhances the user web experience by adding content from different resources, modifying the original layout, or reducing interactions during web searches, among other benefits. To reduce user interactions and satisfy their information necessities, we propose MAWA, an extension for Firefox mobile that allows users to adapt any web page to their needs through web augmentation techniques. To validate our proposal, an evaluation of the tool has been carried out. The article presents the benefits introduced by MAWA as a response to the inconveniences experienced by users when performing their activities in the mobile browser. The results obtained show that MAWA is able to reduce the number of interactions significantly, as well as to reduce battery consumption and the time needed to obtain the desired information. In addition, users perceive that navigation is less cluttered.},

However, as software systems grow in complexity, low-code platforms need to adapt as well. Notably, nowadays this implies adapting to the modeling and generation of smart software. At the same time, if we want to broaden the userbase of this type of tools, we should also be able to provide more open source alternatives that help potential users avoid vendor lock-ins and give them the freedom to explore low-code development approaches (even adapting the tool to better fit their needs). To fulfil these needs, we are building BESSER, an open source low-code platform for developing (smart) software. BESSER offers various forms (i.e., notations) for system and domain specification (e.g. UML for technical users and chatbots for business users) together with a number of generators. Both types of components can be extended and are open to contributions from the community.},

  abstract     = {Programs, like people, get old. The same is true for models, which can become obsolete due to a diversity of factors such as changing requirements, data drift or evolution of the domain itself. Preventing or addressing obsolescence as early as possible helps to reduce the significant costs, risks, and uncertainties incurred by obsolete models and the software system generated from them. Indeed, obsolescence in models can easily propagate to errors in the system resulting in behavioral uncertainty marked by unforeseen, emergent, or unpredictable behavior. Nevertheless, methods and strategies to identify, anticipate, minimize, and manage model obsolescence are presently lacking. This paper presents an innovative approach to tackle model obsolescence. We have designed a domain-specific language (DSL) to specify potential aging and degradation conditions for model elements. Based on the DSL annotations and the history of changes in a model, we can pinpoint those elements that require validation or risk becoming obsolete. Both the DSL and the engine to calculate the obsolescence status of the elements in a model have been released as part of the open-source BESSER modeling platform.},

  abstract     = {The application of wind energy leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on conventional sources of fuels. Nevertheless, traditional Savonius wind energy systems suffer from high negative torque and low efficiency. Therefore, the optimization of the blade shape of the Savonius wind turbine is an effective approach to enhance the use of clean and sustainable wind energy. In this work, selecting supplementary blades with quarter elliptical shapes is proposed to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency of the Savonius rotor by enhancing the amount of captured wind at minimal cost. The turbulence model SST/k–ω is used in ANSYS fluent to numerically simulate the performance of the rotor with supplementary blades. As a function of tip speed ratio (TSR), the torque coefficient (Ct) and power coefficient (Cp) are computed. Furthermore, the total pressure, velocity, and streamlines are estimated and analyzed. The results showed that the supplementary blades have the ability to enhance the output power of the turbine by lowering the negative drag behind the returning blade. Overall, the new configuration enhances the suction vortices and reverses flow, leading to better aerodynamic performance. The maximum Cp for the new configuration is observed at TSR = 0.5 with a value of 0.181 which is 13.1},

Two swarm intelligence-based algorithms have been used to solve the computationally challenging optimization problem. These evolutionary algorithms are a discrete fireworks algorithm and a discrete artificial bee colony algorithm with an ensemble of local search methods.

  abstract     = {Background Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionized the formulation and development of modern pharmaceuticals. With the help of AI, researchers can now optimize drug design, develop formulations, and streamline clinical trials in a much accurate and efficient way. Drug development might be greatly expedited and time-consuming procedure; however, with the help of AI this are significantly reduced. Main body of abstract The main advantages of AI in pharmaceutical formulation are its capacity to analyse vast amounts of data and spot patterns and connections that human researchers would miss. Various tools and technologies, such as ANN, fuzzy logic, neuro-fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm are used for analysing the date, of which ANN is popular and mostly used. AI enables the discovery of novel pharmacological targets and the creation of more potent medications. AI may also be used to improve medication formulations by forecasting the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of drug candidates, increasing the likelihood that clinical trials will be successful. AI is also applied in designing clinical trials, reducing the time and cost of the process by identifying patient populations that are most likely to benefit from the treatment. Additionally, AI can monitor patients during clinical trials, detecting real-time adverse effects and adjusting dosages to improve patient outcomes. Conclusion AI is a potent pharmaceutical formulation and development tool, allowing researchers to analyse vast amounts of data, optimize drug formulations, and streamline clinical trials. As technology develops, experts anticipate that AI will increasingly show a crucial part in drug development, enabling faster, more efficient, and more effective treatments for various diseases.},

However, the semantics of SysML is given in natural language, which does not allow formal and rigorous reasoning necessary for critical systems for which safety and security are major concerns. Our project aims at modeling and verifying high-level architectures of critical complex systems, in particular railways systems, that must be validated by domain experts. For that, we propose to combine SysML and the Event-B formal method. To master the complexity of such systems, Event-B provides refinement and decomposition mechanisms that allow a step-by-step design and make proofs easier to discharge. This paper proposes to extend SysML with safety relevant Event-B mechanisms that enable an automatic translation from SysML diagrams to Event-B specifications. We focus on diagrams that facilitate high-level architecture design, namely package, block-definition, state-transition and sequence diagrams.},

The development of lunar probes is characterized by high autonomy, top-level driving, and complex mission scenarios filled with many unknowns. This paper adopts a model-based systems engineering approach and utilizes SYSML to propose a comprehensive process for the design and validation of typical lunar probe mission scenarios. Special attention is given to the scenario of regional water resource collection, which is thoroughly modeled. Through digital simulation and analysis of simulation data, the reliability of the model-based systems engineering approach in the design phase of lunar probes is further verified, providing strong support and guidance for the implementation of future lunar exploration missions.},

  abstract     = {Software reverse engineering (SRE) is receiving more attention due to the current trend for rapid software development, since this allows developers to implement systems without any detailed design process and then use SRE tools to generate the design content, such as unified modeling language (UML) diagrams. In extant SRE research, studies have mainly focused on how precisely the conversion can reflect the system. However, little research has investigated the quality of the converted results, which could be inherently affected by poorly written software code. Accordingly, a knowledge-based ontological system (OntoRESec) was developed in this study to enable the online quality assessment of converted UML structural design content. With a focus on class design, OntoRESec features a domain-specific ontology model with a rule-based inference engine to assess the reversed class diagrams in SRE. With regard to the domain of quality assessment, the system is scoped to security in class design, since this is a major concern in terms of design quality and should be incorporated into the automated SRE context. An illustrative case is presented that adopts a security framework (STRIDE) to implement and demonstrate the rule-based inference of quality assessment in OntoRESec. In addition, several system cases are used to evaluate the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {Agile methods are now commonly used to design critical systems. They consist in progressively doing increments to a model, and subsequently checking that all previously checked properties are still satisfied. Yet, model-checking is not inherently incremental, which means that all proofs must be redone at each stage, where one would expect to redo proofs only for parts of the systems that have been impacted by the modification. This makes model evolution costly and hampers the use of agile development methods. The paper proposes to facilitate model updates (also called mutations): whenever a mutation is performed on a model, the algorithms introduced in this paper can determine which proofs remain valid and which ones must be performed again. The main idea to reduce the proof obligation is to identify new possible execution paths that need to be re-verified. Our algorithm reuses the results of proofs applied to a previous model version. The paper applies this approach on dependency graphs generated from SysML models: our generic propagation algorithm can rework mutated dependency graphs so as to deduce more simple properties to be proved on reduced dependency graphs. Our approach can handle reachability properties and discusses extensions to liveness properties. The embedded system of an autonomous vehicle, characterized by real-time communication constraints, exemplifies the challenges and relevance of our approach.},

Traditionally, the development of the code is a human-intensive act and prone to misinterpretation and defects. The defect elimination process is again an arduous time-consuming task with increased time-to-deliver and cost. Hence, a novel approach is proposed to generate the code with the activity diagram and sequence diagram as the focus. The activity diagram and sequence diagrams and are defined as part of the UML definition to define the object flow of the system and interaction between the objects, respectively. An XMI schema is a text representation of any software model that is exported from a modeling tool. The modeling tool BoUML exports the required schema from the given input models such as sequence diagrams and activity diagrams. The proposed JC_Gen extracts artifacts from the XMI schema of these two models to generate the code automatically. The focus is mainly on class definition, member declaration, methods’ definition, and function call in generated code.},

Blockchain technology, which includes an inherent consensus mechanism and programming languages, enables the concept of smart contracts. However, smart contracts written in an existing language, such as Solidity, Vyper, and others, are difficult for domain stakeholders and programmers to understand in order to develop code efficiently and without error, owing to a conceptual gap between the contractual provisions and the respective code. Our study addresses the problem by creating smart legal contract markup language (SLCML), an XML-based smart-contract language with pattern and transformation rules that automatically convert XML code to the Solidity language. In particular, we develop an XML schema (SLCML schema) that is used to instantiate any type of business contract understandable to IT and non-IT practitioners and is processed by computers. To reduce the effort and risk associated with smart contract development, we advocate a pattern for converting SLCML contracts to Solidity smart contracts, a smart contractual oriented computer language. We exemplify and assess our SLCML and transformation approach by defining a dairy supply chain contract based on real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Model-based engineering emerged as an approach to tackle the complexity of current system development. In particular, compositional strategies assume that systems can be built from reusable and loosely coupled units. However, it is still a challenge to ensure that desired properties hold for component integration. We present a component-based model for UML, including a metamodel, well-formedness conditions and formal semantics via translation into BRIC; the presentation of the semantics is given by a set of rules that cover all the metamodel elements and map them to their respective BRIC denotations. We use our previous work on BRIC as an underlying (and totally hidden) component development framework so that our approach benefits from all the formal infrastructure developed for BRIC using CSP. Component composition, specified via UML structural diagrams, ensures adherence to classical concurrent properties: our focus is on the preservation of deadlock freedom. Automated support is developed as a plug-in to the Astah modelling tool. Verification is carried out using FDR (a model checker for CSP); we address scalability using compositional reasoning (inherent to the approach) and behavioural patterns. The formal reasoning is transparent to the user: a distinguishing feature of our approach is its support for traceability. For instance, when FDR uncovers a deadlock, a sequence diagram is constructed from the deadlock trace and presented to the user at the modelling level. The overall approach is illustrated with a running example and two additional case studies.},

Starting from a high-level but textual notation, DAML thus implements the lower end of a model-driven development process, from a platform-specific level to implementations on a range of blockchain platforms. Existing approaches for modelling smart contracts support a domain-oriented, conceptual view but do not link to the same technology-specific level. We develop a notation based on class diagrams and visual contracts that map directly to DAML smart contracts. The approach is grounded in an operational semantics in terms of graph transformation that accounts for the more complex behavioural features of DAML, such as its role-based access control and the order of contract execution and archival. The models, with their mappings to DAML and their operational semantics, are introduced via the Doodle case study from a DAML tutorial and validated through testing the graph transformation system against the DAML code using the Groove model checker.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the most widespread software quality assurance methods in the avionics domain are semi-automated reviews and testing. However, their effort grows disproportionately to the size of the system under development. Also, these methods cannot achieve exhaustive coverage due to the complexity of today’s avionics systems and their potentially infinite set of combinations of possible inputs and system states. Furthermore, the later software issues are detected in the development process, the more expensive it is to fix them. To overcome these issues, a model-driven verification approach for modeling and analyzing avionics systems in early phases of the development is presented. To this end, semantics is given to SysML v2 models by a mapping to a theorem prover encoding. The development of a dedicated SysML v2 profile supporting event-driven data flow specifications, the encoding of corresponding structures in the theorem prover Isabelle, and a generator creating theorems from SysML v2 models are presented. The approach is evaluated by formally proving a representative liveness property of a hierarchical system model from the avionics domain. Since liveness properties can be negated only by infinite data sequences and thus cannot be covered exhaustively by testing, this case study demonstrates the added value for meeting typical safety requirements in the avionics domain. The results can be transferred from avionics to other domains, as well.},

  abstract     = {In the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a new paradigm aimed at providing technological solutions for the monitoring and control of physical entities (so-called objects - cars, furniture, buildings). These new solutions encompass heterogeneous devices capable of: capturing information about the physical entities to which they are attached and/or the environment in which they are inserted, performing sensing tasks; acting on the physical domain, performing actuation tasks; and communicating with each other and/or with other systems via the Internet to achieve common goals. However, Designing systems of this kind is a real challenge and modeling with UML is consolidating itself as a resource to surmount this challenge. To deal with this situation, we contribute by proposing an adaptation of UML2.5 to IoT systems. It is in this context that we have defined a UML2.5 profile for the IoT system. This profile includes a set of stereotypes applied to meta-classes from the UML2.5 meta-model. These stereotypes are complemented by formal constraints in OCL. These extensions allow to improve the consistency checking of reusable system architectures.},

  abstract     = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are rarely developed from scratch. Commonly, they emerge from one product when there is a need to create tailored variants, or from existing variants created in an ad-hoc way once their separated maintenance and evolution become challenging. Despite the vast literature about re-engineering systems into SPLs and related technical approaches, there is a lack of detailed analysis of the process itself and the effort involved. In this paper, we provide and analyze empirical data of the extraction processes of two open-source case studies, namely ArgoUML and Phaser. Both cases emerged from the transition of a monolithic system into an SPL. The analysis relies on information mined from the version control history of their respective source-code repositories and the discussion with developers that took part in the process. Unlike previous works that focused mostly on the structural results of the final SPL, the contribution of this study is an in-depth characterization of the processes. With this work, we aimed at providing a deeper understanding of the strategies for SPL extraction and their implications. Our results indicate that the source code changes can range from almost a fourth to over half of the total lines of code. Developers may or may not use branching strategies for feature extraction. Additionally, the problems faced during the extraction process may be due to lack of tool support, complexity on managing feature dependencies and issues with feature constraints. We made publicly available the datasets and the analysis scripts of both case studies to be used as a baseline for extractive SPL adoption research and practice.},

However, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been implemented to classify satellite images, achieving better accuracy in discriminating complex landcover features. This study aims to characterise various ML models for detecting and classifying lead–zinc open pit mining areas amidst surrounding landcover features based on Sentinel 2 image analysis. Various associated band ratios and spectral indices were integrated with processed Sentinel 2 reflectance bands to enhance detection accuracy. Suitable bands highlighting lead and zinc mine areas were identified based on optimal index factor (OIF) analysis and various deep learning-based stacked encoders. Furthermore, 15 different ML classifiers were tested to identify optimised algorithms for accurately discriminating complex mining areas and associated landcover features. After detailed evaluation and comparison of their accuracies, the extra tree classifier (et) was the most effective, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.94 and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The light gradient boosting machine classifier (lightgbm) and random forest classifier (rf) models also performed well, with overall accuracies of 0.937 and 0.936 and kappa coefficients of 0.925 and 0.925, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Many researchers from different fields have tried to figure out how to forecast the future and trade on the share market since it is hard to accomplish because the market is so complicated. Machine-learning techniques have been exceptionally productive in this domain in recent times. Financial experts are creating a “trading system” for stock returns and trend forecasting. Since “trading online” was introduced, the amount of transactions that take place on the equity market each day has seen a significant increase. The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based trading framework not only forecasts the market but also finds out the best bull and bearish weekdays for trading. So here in this framework, we proposed an automated machine-learning (AutoML) online trading system that combines two modules. The first module finds the best weekdays to be bull or bearish with an algorithmic trading strategy. The second module combines two sub-models: an ensemble-based classification module and an ensemble-based regression module. The bagging classifier with the Extra Tree classifier is used as the classification model, whereas the bagging regressor with SGD regressor is used for the regression model. Different matrices were followed as per the criteria with Nifty-50 indices for model performance evaluation purposes by us. The regression model has an average RMSE value of 0.2091 MSE value of 0.0551, and the classification model’s accuracy range varies between 95.65 and 99.59. With the help of this framework, even if a little knowledge, investors can minimize investment loss and maximize their profit.},

We provide two solutions for accessing the data, including a web-based interface for immediate access and a REST API for broader integration with external frameworks. The REST API allows for seamless incorporation of simulation data into diverse workflows, offering flexibility and ease of use. Our contribution improves the usability of the ConcurrentSim ecosystem and demonstrates the power of macro expansion in Julia for creating dynamic ORM configurations. Thereby, we simplify data persistence and enhance user productivity by removing most of the technical overhead, enabling users to focus on analysis.},

  abstract     = {The demands of product individualization and reduced development times are an increasing challenge for current product and production system engineering, as customization processes are still a mostly manual task involving different software tools and paperwork. Due to their manual nature, they are error-prone, leading to long lead times and costly rework. Thus, efficient co-customization of products and their production systems must be enabled by common data models and continuously linked software tools. Complex mechatronic products such as aircraft cabins are more and more likely to be developed via a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach using Systems Modeling Language (SysML). In assembly system design, model-based development often relies on AutomationML, a modeling and data exchange format for plant engineering information. To combine these concepts, an approach for assembly system configuration based on a SysML-representation of the product and an AutomationML-represantation of the plant is proposed. After the customer configures a unique product version, the corresponding SysML model will be analyzed by the outlined configuration algorithm to determine necessary changes to the assembly system. Based upon an AutomationML library with digital representations of the available assembly system components and their behavior, these logical and parametric changes will be implemented in the instantiated assembly system model. Using AutomationML, configuration can not only take place on the top-level logical model, but also on specific robot or PLC programs. These can be then used for simulations generating information about assemblability and assembly times, allowing improved design decisions once fed back to the product engineers.},

  abstract     = {Integrating new functions into the aircraft can, for example, increase performance or reduce fuel consumption. Since the installation of such additional functions increases the overall aircraft complexity, it is crucial to adapt methods and tools that support the development and ensure traceability, consistency, and verifiability. In this context, model-based systems engineering and the associated Systems Modeling Language (SysML) have been established as a standard methodology. This paper presents an overview of a system development and modeling process with SysML at the concept design stage using a position-variable shock control bumps system as an example. In addition to the system modeling, safety and reliability analyses have to be considered during the design process. To keep both, the model and the associated safety assessment consistent, this work introduces an extension of SysML to enable the execution of a functional hazard assessment (FHA) according to the ARP4754A and ARP 4761 guidelines. This is the first step in conducting a model-based safety assessment. Furthermore, a modeling process with concepts management methods is performed. In summary, the presented modeling process consists of three main parts: the system modeling, functional hazard assessment and concept management.},

Such input texts do not reflect real-world requirements documents. To address this issue, we propose a pipeline for preprocessing such requirements documents at the conceptual level, for subsequent automatic generation of class, activity, and use case models in the Unified Modelling Language (UML) downstream. Our pipeline consists of three steps. Firstly, we implement entity-based extractive summarization of the raw text to enable highlighting certain parts of the requirements that are of interest to the modelling goal. Secondly, we develop a rule-based bucketing method for selecting sentences into a range of ‘buckets’ for transformation into their corresponding UML models. Finally, to prove the effectiveness of supervised machine learning models on requirements texts, a sequence labelling model is applied to the text specific for class modelling to distinguish classes and attributes in the running text. In order to enable this step of our pipeline, we address the lack of available annotated data by labelling the widely used PURE requirements dataset on a word level by tagging classes and attributes within the texts. We validate our findings using this extended dataset.},

  abstract     = {Simulation tools are essential for designing and testing car setups in modern racecar competitions: state-of-the-art full-body simulators replicate driving conditions, but they require detailed tuning ( alignment ) of hundreds or thousands of parameters to reduce the reality gap. This procedure is performed by comparing simulations with real-world data (Formula 1 teams collect data in the order of terabytes every race weekend), most often visually, resulting in a time-consuming operation that requires advanced expertise. Additionally, the process is not formally encoded, relies on human intuition and expertise, and thus results are highly subjective and may vary depending on who is performing the operation. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline for parameter tuning in full-body racing simulators. This pipeline replicates the manual tuning workflow, but substituting subjective visual comparisons with an objective cost function—the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). We validate the proposed approach by comparing the quality of the alignment and the time required to achieve it between experts performing manual tuning and the proposed automated pipeline. We find that automating the process requires a similar number of simulations to be performed compared to manual tuning, but the automated pipeline is significantly faster and more consistent.},

Essentially, such platforms allow to shift from coding to graphical modeling, helping to improve quality and reduce development time. The Cordis SUITE is a low-code development platform that adopts the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to design complex machine-control applications. In this paper we introduce Cordis models and their semantics. To enable formal verification, we define an automatic translation of Cordis models to the process algebraic specification language mCRL2. As a proof of concept, we describe requirements of the control software of an industrial cylinder model developed by Cordis, and show how these can be verified using model checking. We show that our verification approach is effective to uncover subtle issues in the industrial model and its implementation.},

Biomodels is a repository of peer-reviewed models represented in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Most of these models are quantitative, but in some cases, qualitative models—such as Boolean networks (BNs)—are better suited. This paper focuses on the automatic transformation of quantitative SBML models to Boolean networks. We propose SBML2BN, a pipeline dedicated to this task. Our approach takes advantage of several SBML elements (reactions, rules, events) as well as a numerical simulation of the concentration of the species over time to constrain both the structure and the dynamics of the Boolean networks to synthesise. Finding all the BNs complying with the given structure and dynamics was formalised as an optimisation problem solved in the answer-set programming framework. We run SBML2BN on more than 200 quantitative SBML models, and we provide evidence that one can automatically construct Boolean networks which are compatible with the structure and the dynamics of an SBML model. In case the SBML model includes rules or events, we also show how the evaluation criteria are impacted when taking these elements into account.},

The DNA damage response (DDR) and DOT1L/H3K79me pathways are required to maintain LSCs in MLLr -AML, but little is known about their interplay. This study revealed that the DDR enzyme ATM regulates the maintenance of LSCs in MLLr -AML with a sequential protein-posttranslational-modification manner via CBP-DOT1L. We identified the phosphorylation of CBP by ATM, which confers the stability of CBP by preventing its proteasomal degradation, and characterised the acetylation of DOT1L by CBP, which mediates the high level of H3K79me2 for the expression of leukaemia genes in MLLr -AML. In addition, we revealed that the regulation of CBP-DOT1L axis in MLLr -AML by ATM was independent of DNA damage activation. Our findings provide insight into the signalling pathways involoved in MLLr -AML and broaden the understanding of the role of DDR enzymes beyond processing DNA damage, as well as identigying them as potent cancer targets.},

Since the shape of the high-speed train head closely influences its surrounding airflow, optimizing the head shape is the primary way to reduce the aerodynamic drag. However, existing optimization methods have limitations in parametrically describing the train head with enough details and fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel parametric modeling method based on the approximate analytical partial differential equation (PDE) for the aerodynamic shape optimization of high-speed train heads. With this method, the detailed shape of the train head is controlled by four design parameters. To enhance the optimization efficiency, a two-stage multilayer perceptron (MLP) surrogate model is proposed to predict the aerodynamic drag coefficients of the high-speed train, and a classic genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to optimize the total drag coefficient and generate the train head shape with good aerodynamic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through several comparison experiments.},

Model based active learning (AL) data sampling strategies have shown potential for further optimization. This paper introduces a workflow for conducting DOE comparative studies using automated machine learning. Based on a practical definition of model complexity in the context of machine learning, the interplay of systematic data generation and model performance is examined considering various sources of uncertainty: this includes uncertainties caused by stochastic sampling strategies, imprecise data, suboptimal modeling, and model evaluation. Results obtained from electrical circuit models with varying complexity show that not all AL sampling strategies outperform conventional DOE strategies, depending on the available data volume, the complexity of the dataset, and data uncertainties. Trade-offs in resource allocation strategies, in particular between identical replication of data points for statistical noise reduction and broad sampling for maximum parameter space exploration, and their impact on subsequent machine learning analysis are systematically investigated. Results indicate that replication oriented strategies should not be dismissed but may prove advantageous for cases with non-negligible noise impact and intermediate resource availability. The provided workflow can be used to simulate practical experimental conditions for DOE testing and DOE selection.},

  abstract     = {Requirements engineering focuses on eliciting, specifying, transforming and validating user and system requirements correctly and efficiently. Transforming user requirements to system requirements is a critical step in this process. It is a challenging because the high-level intentions of users often lack the detailed information to help specify system requirements. In practice, the successful transformation from user requirements to system requirements is labor-intensive, which requires the sophisticated human efforts of domain experts and developers for information processing and supplementation. It is desirable to have a method for automatically transforming user requirements into system requirements. In this paper, we propose an approach iStar2UML that can automatically transform the user requirements of iStar into the system requirements specified by UML models. iStar is a well-known goal-oriented model for eliciting and specifying user requirements; it concentrates on analyzing intentions and social dependencies of stakeholders. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a de facto standard for object-oriented system requirements modeling and design. We evaluate the proposed approach through five case studies.

Through collaborative modeling, end-users, stakeholders, experts, and entrepreneurs are able to create a shared understanding of a system representation. While the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the major conceptual modeling languages in object-oriented software engineering, more and more concerns arise from the modeling quality of UML and its tool-support. Among them, the limitation of the two-dimensional presentation of its notations and lack of natural collaborative modeling tools are reported to be significant. In this paper, we explore the potential of using virtual reality (VR) technology for collaborative UML software design by comparing it with classical collaborative software design using conventional devices (desktop PC/laptop). For this purpose, we have developed a VR modeling environment that offers a natural collaborative modeling experience for UML Class Diagrams. Based on a user study with 24 participants, we have compared collaborative VR modeling with conventional modeling with regard to efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Results show that the use of VR has some disadvantages concerning efficiency and effectiveness, but the user’s fun, the feeling of being in the same room with a remote collaborator, and the naturalness of collaboration were increased.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the valuation of geometric Asian power options and presents an efficient numerical algorithm for solving the option price PDE. The analytical methodology utilizes the fractional Ito formula and replicating portfolio techniques to derive a PDE that characterizes the option price. However, due to the lack of an analytical solution for this PDE, a numerical method is proposed to solve it. The numerical solution involves implementing a time-semi-discrete scheme obtained through forward time difference approximation, while the other derivatives in the equation are approximated using cubic B-spline quasi-interpolation approximation. By employing the respective scheme and incorporating the initial and boundary conditions, the numerical solution for the equation is obtained. Subsequently, the stability of the method is investigated, and numerical results are presented.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach for assessing the uncertainty in vibration and static responses of laminated composite beams resulting from uncertainty in material properties and distributed loads. The proposed method utilizes surrogate models developed using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based on a relatively small sample size. These training samples are computed using a high-order shear beam model in which the governing equations are derived using Hamilton's principle, and solved by Ritz’s approach using a trigonometric series approximation. The proposed PCE model's coefficients are estimated using the spectral projection and linear regression techniques. The first four statistical moments and probability distributions of the mid-span displacement and the fundamental frequency of laminated composite beams are predicted. Global sensitivity analysis is also conducted to assess how material property variation and stochastic loads affect the beam's deflection and the fundamental frequency. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed PCE models are compared with those from Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). A remarkable reduction in the computational cost of PCE models compared to MCS is observed without compromising the predictions' accuracy. As most real-world systems are subjected to multiple sources of uncertainty, this study provides a state-of-the-art method to quantify such uncertain parameters more efficiently and allow for a better reliability assessment in composite beam design.},

The sequence of choices of the penalty taker is generated by a stochastic chain with memory of variable length. It has been conjectured that the probability distribution of the response times is a function of the specific sequence of past choices governing the algorithm used by the penalty taker to make his choice at each step. We found empirical evidence that besides this dependence, the distribution of the response times depends also on the success or failure of the previous prediction made by the participant. Moreover, we found statistical evidence that this dependence propagates up to two steps forward after the prediction failure.},

We study the influence of stationary distribution of semi-Markov process on extinction of brucellosis in switching environment including both stable states, during which brucellosis dies out, and unstable states, during which brucellosis persists. The results show that increasing the frequencies and average dwell times in stable states to certain extent can ensure the extinction of brucellosis. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the analytical results. We also suggest that herdsmen should reduce the densities of animal habitation to decrease the contact rate, increase slaughter rate of animals and apply disinfection measures to kill brucella.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we deal with the problem of European vulnerable option pricing under the mixed fractional Brownian motion with stochastic corporate liabilities and jumps. Assume that the dynamics of all assets including the underlying asset, the counterparty’s assets and corporate liabilities are given by three interrelated jump-diffusion processes. Jumps are divided into a systematic component which affects the prices of all assets and an idiosyncratic component affecting each asset price. Under this framework, the pricing formulae for vulnerable options are derived using an actuarial approach. Further, we discuss some properties of the pricing formulae, which reveal that our model contains not only the traditional pure diffusion processes such as Black–Scholes model (J Polit Econ 81:637–659, 1973) and Klein model (J Bank Finance 20:1211–1229, 1996), but also the jump-diffusion processes such as Merton jump model (J Financial Econ 3:125–144, 1976), Tian et al. model (J Futures Mark 34:957–979, 2014) and Zhou et al. model (Acta Math Appl Sin-E 35:305–318, 2019). The numerical results show that the randomness of the corporate liabilities may reduce the expected payoff of the option holder at maturity time and also increase the likelihood of default, thus it reduces the vulnerable option price.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a Markov-modulated stochastic volatility model that captures the dependency of market regimes on investor sentiment. The main contribution lies in developing a modified version of the classical Heston model by allowing for a sentiment-driven bias in the volatility of the asset. Specifically, a two-factor Markov-modulated stochastic volatility model is proposed, integrating a diffusion coefficient in the risky asset dynamics and a correlation parameter influenced by both the volatility process and a continuous-time Markov chain accounting for the sentiment-bias. Diverging from conventional approaches in option pricing models, this framework operates under the real-world probability measure, necessitating considerations about the existence of an equivalent martingale pricing measure. The purpose of this paper is to derive a closed formula for the pricing of European-style derivatives and to fit the model on market data through a suitable calibration procedure. A comparison with the Heston benchmark model is provided for a sample of Apple, Amazon, and Bank of America stock options.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an advanced and detailed analysis of the mechanisms of hepatitis B virus (HBV) propagation in an environment characterized by variability and stochas-ticity. Based on some biological features of the virus and the assumptions, the corresponding deterministic model is formulated, which takes into consideration the effect of vaccination. This deterministic model is extended to a stochastic framework by considering a new form of disturbance which makes it possible to simulate strong and significant fluctuations. The long-term behaviors of the virus are predicted by using stochastic differential equations with second-order multiplicative α -stable jumps. By developing the assumptions and employing the novel theoretical tools, the threshold parameter responsible for ergodicity (persistence) and extinction is provided. The theoretical results of the current study are validated by numerical simulations and parameters estimation is also performed. Moreover, we obtain the following new interesting findings: (a) in each class, the average time depends on the value of α ; (b) the second-order noise has an inverse effect on the spread of the virus; (c) the shapes of population densities at stationary level quickly changes at certain values of α . The last three conclusions can provide a solid research base for further investigation in the field of biological and ecological modeling.},

  abstract     = {Participating life insurance contracts are policies that provide dividends (participation bonuses) based on the insurer’s financial performance. While these products are popular, there exists a gap in the literature for the analysis of these contracts under a stochastic setting. This paper fills this gap by proposing methods to (i) determine performance bonuses, (ii) compute the fair premium of the contract, and (iii) perform risk measurements for participating contracts in a realistic stochastic environment. The specific case of a fixed premium endowment participating contract, where the annual premium remains constant while benefits increase stochastically, is considered. We extend both the variable benefits life insurance approach of Bowers et al. [ 9 ] and the compound reversionary bonus mechanism presented in Booth et al. [ 8 ] and Bacinello [ 2 ] to a stochastic financial market (including stochastic interest rates) and stochastic mortality framework. Monte Carlo simulations provide insight about the sensitivity of premiums to contract specification and the evolution over time of both benefits and risks faced by the insurer.},

These systems face challenges due to the unpredictable behavior of users and the inherent uncertainties of renewable sources, which result in significant voltage fluctuations. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a Kriging-based multi-objective stochastic optimization algorithm designed to minimize voltage fluctuations in photovoltaic and wind power integrated stand-alone microgrid systems. The algorithm optimizes the design of the microgrid by simultaneously minimizing the total cost, carbon emissions, system reliability, and voltage fluctuation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods, achieving lower costs, reduced emissions, and improved reliability while effectively mitigating voltage fluctuations. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a robust solution for enhancing the performance and stability of stand-alone microgrids in areas lacking traditional electrical infrastructure.},

The parameters of the model were estimated based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation and multidimensional search optimization method. The performance of each degradation model was evaluated by introducing Akai Information Criterion and error evaluation method. Through the construction of an ultrasonic motor life test system and the life test, experimental data that can reflect the degradation of motor performance were obtained.

Even though these resonances have been identified in various systems, a transition between them has never been observed before. The present study demonstrates the presence of both resonances in a liquid crystal electroconvection system using combined amplitude and phase noises, which correspond to colored noises with appropriate cutoff frequencies (i.e., finite correlation times). We established the emergence of both resonances and their transition through systematic control of the electroconvection threshold voltage using these two noise sources. Our numerical simulations were experimentally confirmed and revealed how the output performance of the system could be controlled by combining the intensity and cutoff frequency of the two noises. Furthermore, we suggested the crucial contribution of a usually overlooked additional phase noise to the advancements in various noise-related fields.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic volatility models based on Gaussian processes, like fractional Brownian motion, are able to reproduce important stylised facts of financial markets such as rich autocorrelation structures, persistence and roughness of sample paths. This is made possible by virtue of the flexibility introduced in the choice of the covariance function of the Gaussian process. The price to pay is that in general, such models are no longer Markovian nor semimartingales, which limits their practical use. We derive, in two different ways, an explicit analytic expression for the joint characteristic function of the log-price and its integrated variance in general Gaussian stochastic volatility models. That analytic expression can be approximated by closed-form matrix expressions. This opens the door to fast approximation of the joint density and pricing of derivatives on both the stock and its realised variance by using Fourier inversion techniques. In the context of rough volatility modelling, our results apply to the (rough) fractional Stein–Stein model and provide the first analytic formulas for option pricing known to date, generalising that of Stein–Stein, Schöbel–Zhu and a special case of Heston.},

Besides, we verify that the system is stochastic permanence under certain conditions. In addition to that, we prove that the system has an ergodic stationary distribution when the parameters satisfy certain conditions.

These systems replicate the complex behavior of different sectors in society and private enterprises altogether. The model incorporates resilience and survivability measures and the concepts of breaking points, referred to as divergence, and resurgence. The representation of a THE model intends to be more extensive than other representations as it evaluates systems at different performance levels and state spaces through time. The model is meant to be a tool to forecast or anticipate breaking points and resurgence events through THE's lifecycle. It is also designed as a mathematical foundation, allowing decision-makers to view multiple factors simultaneously. To prove the pertinence of the approach, the notable predicaments of Puerto Rico (PR) since 1960 have been transcribed to the mathematical dialect of a THE under stress with real historical data, socioeconomic indexes, and technological innovation indexes. The final resolved Markov chain for PR's case reveals that, for a stressed society, a contracted economy, and a survivable form of technology, the greater probabilities tend to the initial state from a survivable state (i.e., 90.32},

We provide an example showing that one cannot improve the stability of the exiting time and simultaneously improve the continuity of the dependence on initial data. Finally, we analyze the regularization effect of nonlinear noise in preventing blow-up. Precisely, we demonstrate that global existence holds true almost surely provided that the noise is strong enough.},

Such methods are standard for smooth dynamical systems and increasingly used for continuous, non-smooth dynamical systems. However, they are much less used for random dynamical systems, in particular for hybrid models with discrete, random dynamics. Here we propose a geometrical method that works directly with the hybrid system. We illustrate our approach through an application to a hybrid pituitary cell model in which the stochastic dynamics of very few active large-conductance potassium (BK) channels is coupled to a deterministic model of the other ion channels and calcium dynamics. To employ our geometric approach, we exploit the slow–fast structure of the model. The random fast subsystem is analyzed by considering discrete phase planes, corresponding to the discrete number of open BK channels, and stochastic events correspond to jumps between these planes. The evolution within each plane can be understood from nullclines and limit cycles, and the overall dynamics, e.g., whether the model produces a spike or a burst, is determined by the location at which the system jumps from one plane to another. Our approach is generally applicable to other scenarios to study discrete random dynamical systems defined by hybrid stochastic–deterministic models.},

  abstract     = {This study estimates the technical efficiency measures of maize producing farm households in Ethiopia using stochastic frontier (SF) panel models that take different approaches to model firm heterogeneity. The efficiency measures are found to vary depending on how the estimation model treats both unobserved and observed firm heterogeneity. Estimates from the ‘true’ random effects (TRE) models that treat firm effects as heterogeneity are found to be identical to those from pooled SF models. Those results differ from the ones generated from the basic random effects (RE) models that treat firm effects as part of overall technical inefficiency. The more flexible generalised ‘true’ random effects (GTRE) model that splits the error term into firm effects, persistent inefficiency, transient inefficiency, and a random noise component indicates the presence of higher levels of persistent inefficiency than transient inefficiency. The basic truncated-normal RE model and heteroscedastic RE model yields similar efficiency estimates. The GTRE model predict persistent efficiency measures similar to those from the basic RE and flexible RE model with environmental variables incorporated in the variance function as well as in the deterministic production frontier. These results imply that the RE and GTRE panel models provide reliable efficiency estimates for our data compared to the TRE models. All the estimated SF models generate comparable production function parameters in terms of magnitude and sign. Overall, the results underscore the importance of scrutinising stochastic frontier models for their reliability of analytical results before drawing policy inferences.},

Specifically, the underlying firms are assumed to have the value process driven by a Hawkes jump-diffusion model with the continuous parts of the trajectories being driven by correlated Brownian motions, while the jumps being driven by Hawkes processes having general structure of the exciting functions. The proposed framework takes into account the numerically observed facts about the default, i.e., clustering and unexpectedness. Furthermore, the default barriers are assumed to be stochastic in nature and modeled as stochastic processes, affected by common factors reflecting the systematic risk. A sensitivity analysis of default probability and correlation is conducted to investigate the impact of jump risk, clustering, and stochastic default barriers. These numerical studies demonstrate that jump clustering increases the default probability but reduces the correlation of defaults.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comparison of two multi-fidelity methods for the forward uncertainty quantification of a naval engineering problem. Specifically, we consider the problem of quantifying the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic resistance of a roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry advancing in calm water and subject to two operational uncertainties (ship speed and payload). The first four statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), and the probability density function for such quantity of interest (QoI) are computed with two multi-fidelity methods, i.e., the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC) and an adaptive multi-fidelity Stochastic Radial Basis Functions (SRBF). The QoI is evaluated via computational fluid dynamics simulations, which are performed with the in-house unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) multi-grid solver 
$$\chi$$
 χ navis. The different fidelities employed by both methods are obtained by stopping the RANS solver at different grid levels of the multi-grid cycle. The performance of both methods are presented and discussed: in a nutshell, the findings suggest that, at least for the current implementation of both methods, MISC could be preferred whenever a limited computational budget is available, whereas for a larger computational budget SRBF seems to be preferable, thanks to its robustness to the numerical noise in the evaluations of the QoI.},

  abstract     = {Cell proliferation often experiences a density-dependent intrinsic proliferation rate (IPR) and negative feedback from growth-inhibiting molecules in culture media. The lack of flexible models with explanatory parameters fails to capture such a proliferation mechanism. We propose an extended logistic growth law with the density-dependent IPR and additional negative feedback. The extended parameters of the proposed model can be interpreted as density-dependent cell-cell cooperation and negative feedback on cell proliferation. Moreover, we incorporate further density regulation for flexibility in the model through environmental resistance on cells. The proposed growth law has similarities with the strong Allee model and harvesting phenomenon. We also develop the stochastic analog of the deterministic model by representing possible heterogeneity in growth-inhibiting molecules and environmental perturbation of the culture setup as correlated multiplicative and additive noises. The model provides a conditional maximum sustainable stable cell density (MSSCD) and a new fitness measure for proliferative cells. The proposed model shows superiority to the logistic law after fitting to real cell culture datasets. We illustrate both conditional MSSCD and the new cell fitness for a range of parameters. The cell density distributions reveal the chance of overproliferation, underproliferation, or decay for different parameter sets under the deterministic and stochastic setups.},

  abstract     = {A modified four-variable Hindmarsh–Rose (HR) neuronal model incorporating electromagnetic induction effects is proposed by integrating sine-Wiener bounded noise and time delay. Through systematic numerical simulations, this study examines the synergistic effects of bounded noise and temporal delay on stochastic resonance (SR) characteristics in neuronal electrical activity. The spectral response patterns were quantitatively analyzed using Fourier coefficient, revealing three distinct resonance configurations: single-peak, double-peak, and triple-peak profiles, which serve as characteristic signatures of SR phenomena. Notably, numerical results demonstrate that temporal delay and noise correlation time can induce multi-stochastic resonance behavior, while noise intensity variation maintains monostable resonance characteristics. Parameter optimization analysis indicates that appropriate selection of temporal delay and noise parameters enables precise frequency-matching between endogenous neuronal oscillations and external forcing currents, accompanied by enhanced phase synchronization between input signals and output responses. These findings provide theoretical foundations for neuromorphic engineering applications requiring adaptive signal detection in noisy biological environments.},

This paper aims to investigate noise-induced phenomenological bifurcation (P-bifurcation) and the influence of noises on the population model. With the help of Fokker–Planck equation, we obtain the stationary probability distribution (SPD) of the model, and find that the shape of SPD experiences a transition from one structure to another when the noise intensity passes through a critical value, i.e., the P-bifurcation occurs. Moreover, detailed analysis and simulations for stochastic logistic-like models with weak and strong Allee effects show that the correlated noises have complex effects on the eventual distribution of population size.

Data science plays a crucial role, helping us constructing more accurate dynamical models that capture and reflect the true dynamical changes of a system. At the same time, data science is also a powerful tool for deriving exact solutions of a system. By integrating it with deep learning algorithms, we are able to effectively predict the system responses and successfully apply this in several applications, such as airfoil flutter, arm musculoskeletal system, financial market, and epidemiology. In addition, inverse problems also occupy a pivotal position.

  abstract     = {With the development of the electric vehicle industry, the number of power batteries has increased dramatically. Establishing a recycling EOL (end-of-life) battery network for secondary use is an effective way to solve resource shortage and environmental pollution. However, existing networks are challenging due to the high uncertainty of EOL batteries, e.g., quantity and quality, resulting in a low recycling rate of the recovery network. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a stochastic programming approach for recovery network design under uncertain conditions of EOL batteries. Firstly, a multi-objective model for battery recovery network is established, considering carbon emissions and economic benefits. Secondly, a stochastic programming approach is proposed to clarify the model. Subsequently, the genetic algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. Finally, a recovery network case of Region T is given to verify the credibility and superiority of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces carbon emissions by 20 metric tons and increases overall economic benefits by 10 million yuan in Region T compared to the deterministic model. Furthermore, the two portions affecting the optimization results are also discussed to provide a reference for reducing carbon emissions and improving economic efficiency in recycling networks.},

The model incorporates the uncertainty in care activity duration via sample average approximation.We employ a Monte Carlo Optimization procedure to determine the appropriate sample size to obtain solutions that provide a good trade-off between approximation accuracy and computational time.

There are various nonlinearities and uncertainties in the vehicle suspension system, and even small changes can have a significant impact on the suspension performance. This paper provides an in-depth study of quarter- and half-vehicle suspensions modeled with nonlinear springs and dampers, considering the stochastic uncertainty of various parameters. A mathematical model of a nonlinear vehicle suspension was developed to more accurately simulate the increased stiffness of suspension springs with travel and the energy consumption of dampers. The sparse grid-based polynomial chaos expansion is employed to construct the metamodels of the system response in both the frequency and time domains. This approach effectively captures the stochastic characteristics of the system response, reducing computational cost while improving accuracy. Based on polynomial metamodels, various performance indicators of the nonlinear suspension were analyzed, including statistical moments, probability distributions, and parameter sensitivities. The results are then compared and discussed, revealing that uncertainties in the nonlinear spring, sprung mass, and tire stiffness significantly impact the frequency response, time response, ride comfort, and safety. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic characteristics and behaviors of nonlinear vehicle suspensions under complex parameter uncertainties and provide a reference for enhancing suspension performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the stochastic resonance phenomenon in a bistable system driven by signal-dependent noise is studied. By establishing the Fokker–Planck equation and combining adiabatic approximation theory, the power spectral density useful to describe the stochastic resonance phenomenon is obtained, and the influence of the signal-dependent noise intensity on the power spectral density is analyzed. With the increase in signal-dependent noise intensity, the power spectral density will reach the maximum, which indicates that signal-dependent noise will cause stochastic resonance. In addition, the variation of system parameters with the signal-dependent noise intensity is obtained, and the optimal system parameters under the maximum signal-to-noise ratio are derived. Applying theoretical deduction to image denoising, the experimental results show that the proposed method has higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity values than the existing typical methods.},

  abstract     = {The analytical evaluation of production system performance measures is a difficult task. Over the years, various methods have been developed to solve specific cases of very short production lines. However, formulae for estimating the mean production rate (throughput) are lacking. Recent developments in artificial intelligence simplify their use in the solution of symbolic regression problems. In this work, we use genetic programming (GP) to obtain approximate formulae for calculating the throughput of short reliable approximately balanced production lines, for which the processing times are exponentially distributed. A hybrid GP   GA scheme reduces the search space, in which GP uses genetic algorithms (GA) as a search engine. The scheme produces polynomial formulae for throughput estimation for the first time. To train the GP algorithm we use MARKOV, an accurate algorithm for calculating numerically the exact throughput of short exponential production lines. A few formulae, not previously reported in the literature, are presented. These formulae give close results to the exact results from the MARKOV algorithm, for short (up to five stations) reliable approximately balanced production lines without intermediate buffers. Also, the robustness of these formulae is satisfactory. In addition, the proposed hybrid GP   GA scheme is useful for design/production engineers to adjust the formulae to other ranges of the mean processing rates; the algorithms are quickly retrained to generate a new approximate formula.},

The algorithm consists of a decision tree that incorporates all the 1024 decision nodes that may arise from the information retrieval process of DMs. We calibrate the behavior of the algorithm to the one observed from online users and run several sets of 1,000,000 queries. Each query lets DMs decide which subset of the ten alternatives composing the initial page of results to click, allowing us to evaluate their behavior as ranking reliability is assumed to decrease when DMs decide not to click on an alternative. We compare the click-through rates (CTRs) obtained when modifying the degree of ranking reliability derived from the alternatives displayed on the first page of search results. We illustrate how the stability of the CTR prevails among the top-ranked alternatives within relatively reliable scenarios while it drops when imposing large initial decrements in reliability. The resulting consequences regarding the importance of relative ranking positions are analyzed, the top three alternatives exhibiting a generally contained decrease in their CTRs that contrasts with the cumulative pattern arising from the fourth position onwards.},

The developed method is a hybridization of density-based topology, multilayer perceptron, and water cycle-moth flame algorithm. Firstly, the topology design for flexure mechanism is conducted to create a draft shape of flexure mechanism, and it is redesigned to seek a proper structure. Secondly, datasets of finite element simulations are collected. These data are then normalized, and the feed-forward multilayer perceptron (FMLP) is utilized to formulate the regression models for all performances. In order to determine the best suitable parameters of each FMLP model, their architectures are optimized by the Taguchi technique. By evaluating the measurement indexes such as correlation coefficient, mean square error, and root mean square error, the developed FMLP models show a superiority as compared to the multiple linear regression. Then, the sensitivity of design parameters is investigated. Thirdly, based on the well-established FMLP models, the size optimization is conducted by the water cycle-moth flame algorithm. Finally, in comparison with the FMLP-based differential evolution, FMLP-based firefly algorithm, FMLP-based particle swarm optimization, and FMLP-based teaching-learning based optimization, the present method has a better efficiency through the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests.},

  abstract     = {The seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) is a recently proposed meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by seagull foraging behavior. It has the advantages of simple structure and easy implementation. However, it also has some shortcomings, such as easily falling into local optimal and low convergence accuracy when solving complex engineering optimization problems. In this paper, to overcome the defects of the original SOA, an enhanced seagull optimization algorithm (ESOA) based on mutualism mechanism and commensalism mechanism is proposed. To evaluate the performance of the ESOA algorithm, the IEEE CEC2020 benchmark suite is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the ESOA algorithm, and the results are compared and analyzed with the latest meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. In addition, the ESOA algorithm is applied to twelve different types of engineering optimization problems, including pressure vessel design problem, multiple disc clutch brake design problem, three bar truss design problem, car crashworthiness problem, cantilever beam problem, abrasive water jet machine, gas transmission compressor design problem, hydro-static thrust bearing design problem, speed reducer problem, tubular column design problem, I beam design problem and industrial refrigeration system design problem. The convergence curves of ESOA and the comparison results of the latest metaheuristic algorithms are analyzed and compared with those reported in the latest literature. The results show that the ESOA algorithm is an optimization method that can find the optimal solution in engineering design problems, and has strong competitiveness compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the extent and existence of multiple branches in the distribution network, one of the main challenges in this network will be the issue of fault location. Gradually, with the expansion of smart grids and the use of smart meters in the distribution network, various methods are proposed to use these devices to the fault location. In this paper, fault location in the distribution network is defined as an optimization problem with an objective function based on network voltage changes before and after the fault. The objective function of the problem consists of the difference between the two approaches. In the first approach, the combination of the power flow (PF) method with smart meter data is used to calculate voltage changes before and after the fault in each network node. In the second approach, by calculating the network impedance matrix per the hypothetical fault location in each node of the network, these voltage changes are calculated, and by comparing the results of these two approaches, when the objective function of the problem is minimized, the optimal answer will be the fault location in the network. Therefore, in this issue, two objective functions of the difference between these two approaches are defined, one to identify the faulty section and the other to fault location has been used. The required data are extracted from the network partly before the fault and partly after the fault. Due to the need to process these data, the volume of calculations and the wide distribution network, a genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to solve the problem. To evaluate the speed and accuracy of the proposed method in fault location, the proposed method has been implemented on the largest distribution network, namely the IEEE 123-node distribution test system through MATLAB software. The results showed that the proposed method had a good performance for types of faults and different fault resistance so that it was able to detect the location of the fault with an accuracy of 1.501},

  abstract     = {Under-platform dampers (UPDs) are traditionally used in aircraft engines to reduce the risk of high cycle fatigue. By introducing friction in the system, vibrations at resonance are damped. However, UDPs are also the source of nonlinear behaviours making the analysis and the design of such components complex. The shape of such friction dampers has a substantial impact on the damping performances, and topology optimisation is seldomly utilised—particularly for nonlinear structures. In the present work, we present a numerical approach to optimise the topology of friction dampers in order to minimise the vibration amplitude at a resonance peak. The proposed approach is based on the moving morphable components framework to parametrise the damper topology, and the efficient global optimisation algorithm is employed for the optimisation. The results demonstrate the relevance of such an approach for the optimisation of nonlinear vibrations in the presence of friction. New efficient damper geometries are identified in a few iterations of the algorithm, illustrating the efficiency of the approach. Results show that the most efficient geometry divides the vibration amplitude at resonance by 3, corresponds to a lower mass (80},

In the particular case of model transformations, detecting design patterns contributes to a better comprehension as they carry valuable information on the transformation structure. In this paper, we propose a generic approach to detect, semi-automatically, design patterns and their variations in model transformations. Our approach encodes both design patterns and transformations as strings and use a string-matching algorithm for the detection. The approach is able to detect complete and partial implementations of design patterns in transformations, which is useful to refactoring and improving model transformations.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, wall-climbing robots have begun to replace manual work at heights to reduce economic losses and casualties caused by working at heights. This paper designs a negative pressure adsorption type wall-climbing robot and analyzes the internal fluid movement state of its negative pressure device and the force analysis of the robot when it is adsorbed and balanced. Furthermore, through the experimental prototype, the influence of wall material, robot pose, negative pressure cavity shape and sealing method on the adsorption performance of the wall-climbing robot is explored. The computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) simulation method and experimental results are used to verify each other, which proves the correctness of the simulation results. Based on the Kriging surrogate model, the functional relationship between the impeller blade outlet angle, the impeller inlet diameter, the number of blades as the design variables, the negative pressure as the dependent variable was established, and the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize it. Compared with the original design, the optimized design results of impeller parameters have increased the negative pressure value from 3534.75 to 4491.19 Pa, an increase of 27.06},

  abstract     = {In large-scale disasters, as an important part of the rescue management, buses are often used to evacuate carless people. Timing is always the main concern in any evacuation planning. Hence, not only is minimizing evacuation time the primary goal of bus evacuation problems (BEPs), but computation time to solve a BEP is also crucial. Nevertheless, BEP is NP-hard which makes optimization of the BEP for large-scale disasters within an acceptable time intractable. Practically, sub-optimal but efficient algorithms for bus evacuation planning are desired. In this work a two-step sub-optimal algorithm, called network flow planning (NFP) algorithm is proposed. In the NFP, firstly, an aggregated network flow model, which minimizes the total travel time of all the buses, is adopted. It is proven that the model can be solved as a linear programming problem. The minimum total travel time solution is then converted to approximate the minimum evacuation time solution by assigning evacuation tasks to all buses as equally as possible in the second step. To verify the effectiveness of the NFP algorithm, a greedy algorithm inspired by NFP is presented, and several numerical case studies are presented in this paper. In a Monte Carlo simulation study, randomized cases are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the presented greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm, an approximation algorithm and CPLEX. Furthermore, a real-world large-scale flood disaster case in Xingguo, China is studied, which illustrates the efficiency and practical value of the proposed algorithm in large-scale evacuations.},

  abstract     = {The Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA) is a meta-heuristic algorithm that has been inspired by the vortex phenomenon proposed by Dogan and Olmez in 2015. Like other meta-heuristic algorithms, the VSA has a major problem: it can easily get stuck in local optimum solutions and provide solutions with a slow convergence rate and low accuracy. Thus, chaos theory has been added to the search process of VSA in order to speed up global convergence and gain better performance. In the proposed method, various chaotic maps have been considered for improving the VSA operators and helping to control both exploitation and exploration. The performance of this method was evaluated with 24 UCI standard datasets. In addition, it was evaluated as a Feature Selection (FS) method. The results of simulation showed that chaotic maps (particularly the Tent map) are able to enhance the performance of the VSA. Furthermore, it was clearly shown the fitness of the proposed method in attaining the optimal feature subset with utmost accuracy and the least number of features. If the number of features is equal to 36, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 77.49 and 92.07. If the number of features is 80, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 36.37 and 71.76. If the number of features is 3343, the percentage of accuracy in VSA and the proposed model is 95.48 and 99.70. Finally, the results on Real Application showed that the proposed method has higher percentage of accuracy in comparison to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, a great deal of attention is paid to metaheuristic algorithms to reach the approximate solution in an acceptable computational time. As one of the recent-developed successful metaheuristics, Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) algorithm is according to the inspiration of the rules of social engineering to solve approximate optimization problems. In this research, a Modified Social Engineering Optimizer algorithm (MSEO) by using an adjustment operator is proposed in which there are some assessment criteria for defender and attacker to determine and calculate the weight simultaneously for the first time. This enhancement comprises adding adjustment operators to improve the performance of SEO in terms of search accuracy and running time. Most notably, this operator is utilized to make a better new generation and improve the interaction between the search phases. The adjustment operator strategy is also applied to a novel division based on the best person. As an extensive comparison, the suggested algorithm is tested on fourteen standard benchmark functions and compared with ten well-established and recent optimization algorithms as well as the main version of the SEO algorithm. This algorithm is also tested for sensitivities on the parameters. In this regard, a set of engineering applications were provided to prove and validate the MSEO algorithm for the first time. The experimental outcomes show that the suggested algorithm produces very accurate results which are better than the SEO and other compared algorithms. Most notably, the MSEO provides a very competitive output and a high convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Water pollution escalates with rising waste discharge in river systems, as the rivers’ limited pollution tolerance and constrained self-cleaning capacity compel the release of treated pollutants. Although several studies have shown that the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is an effective algorithm regarding the management of river water quality to reach water quality standards, to our knowledge, the literature lacks using a new optimization model, namely, the multi-objective cuckoo optimization algorithm (MOCOA). Therefore, this research introduces a new optimization framework, including non-dominated sorting and ranking selection using the comparison operator densely populated towards the best Pareto front and a trade-off estimation between the goals of discharges and environmental protection authorities. The suggested algorithm is implemented for a waste load allocation issue in Jajrood River, located in the North of Iran. The limitation of this research is that discharges are point sources. To analyze the performance of the new optimization algorithm, the simulation model is linked with a hybrid optimization model using a cuckoo optimization algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms to convert a single-objective algorithm to a multi-objective algorithm. The findings indicate that, in terms of violation index and inequity values, MOCOA’s Pareto front is superior to NSGA-II, which highlights the MOCOA’s effectiveness in waste load allocation. For instance, with identical population sizes and violation indexes for both algorithms, the optimal Pareto front ranges from 1.31 to 2.36 for NSGA-II and 0.379 to 2.28 for MOCOA. This suggests that MOCOA achieves a superior Pareto front in a more efficient timeframe. Additionally, MOCOA can attain optimal equity in the smaller population size.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary optimization is widely utilized in industrial design. Despite the success of multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms in addressing complex optimization problems, research focusing on input disturbances remains limited. In many manufacturing processes, design parameters are vulnerable to random input disturbances, resulting in products that often perform less effectively than anticipated. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the concept of survival rate. The algorithm comprises two stages: the evolutionary optimization stage and the construction stage of the robust optimal front. In the former stage, we introduce the survival rate as a new optimization objective. Subsequently, we seek a robust optimal front that concurrently addresses convergence and robustness by employing a non-dominated sorting approach. Furthermore, we propose a precise sampling method and a random grouping mechanism to accurately recover solutions resilient to real noise while ensuring population’s diversity. In the latter stage, we introduce a performance measure that integrates both robustness and convergence to guide the construction of the robust optimal front. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of both convergence and robustness compared to existing approaches under noisy conditions.},

To reduce the cost of CI, many companies adopt batching algorithms that combine several commits into a single build, either with a fixed or a dynamically evolving batch size. While a successful, dynamic batching technique has been proposed by earlier work, we propose a fully online, more flexible dynamic batching technique that can be configured on-the-fly and updates batch sizes only based on the outcome of the previous batch build.

A seismic inversion methodology using a genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is proposed in this study to characterize the reservoir both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is usually difficult and expensive to map deeper reservoirs in exploratory operations when using conventional approaches for reservoir characterization hence inversion based on advanced technique (GA and PSO) is proposed in this study. The main goal is to use GA and PSO to significantly lower the fitness (error) function between real seismic data and modeled synthetic data, which will allow us to estimate subsurface properties and accurately characterize the reservoir. Both techniques estimate subsurface properties in a comparable manner. Consequently, a qualitative and quantitative comparison is conducted between these two algorithms. Using two synthetic data and one real data from the Blackfoot field in Canada, the study examined subsurface acoustic impedance and porosity in the inter-well zone. Porosity and acoustic impedance are layer features, but seismic data is an interface property, hence these characteristics provide more useful and applicable reservoir information. The inverted results aid in the understanding of seismic data by providing incredibly high-resolution images of the subsurface. Both the GA and the PSO algorithms deliver outstanding results for both simulated and real data. The inverted section accurately delineated a high porosity zone (

The results indicate that the NSGA-II algorithm integrated with the TOPSIS method is effective in identifying the optimal parameters. Additionally, future studies are encouraged to explore the applicability of these algorithms with various datasets and evaluation criteria to further enhance adaptability. This research underscores the potential of biclustering methods to provide robust and adaptable solutions, particularly in bioinformatics and across a range of other scientific domains.},

Finding good quality software components are internally strong cohesive which reduces the maintenance effort and fasten the development of a software. In this research paper, a new three phase model is proposed for an effective software component reusability prediction. In the first phase, the real time input data are collected from the python programs with 70 number of instances and 16 number of attributes. In the second phase, extra tree classifier is applied to select the best attributes from the collected data on the basis of Gini index. In the final phase, selected attributes are fed to enhanced Harris hawks optimization algorithm for selecting the best reusable software components from the python programs, where the selected best reusable components are adapter, template, singleton, proxy, factory, façade and state. In the experimental phase, proposed model performance is analyzed by means of mean square error, f-test, P-value and sum of squares. Simulation outcome revealed that the proposed model achieved better performance in software component reusability prediction compared to conventional Harris hawks optimization algorithm.

Through the implementation of the Monte-Carlo simulation and Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) algorithm, the stochastic distribution of the bending performance and their critical factors are identified. The results show that the normal distribution is the most suitable for the random distribution of bending performance indicators. The variability of the elastic modulus of ordinary steel bars, initial strain of prestressed steel hinge wires, and constant load axial force has little effect on the bending moment performance, while the yield stress of ordinary steel bars, elastic modulus of concrete, compressive strength of unrestrained concrete, and elastic modulus of prestressed steel hinge wires have a greater impact on the bending performance. Additionally, the compressive strength of unrestrained concrete has a significant influence on the equivalent bending moment of the cross-section that concerns designers.},

  abstract     = {The traditional probabilistic reliability analysis method has problems such as poor convergence, low calculation accuracy, and long time consumption in calculating the reliability of concrete arch bridges due to factors such as the uncertainty of the structural parameters and the performance function being highly nonlinear. This paper proposes a method for calculating the reliability of concrete arch bridges based on the Kriging model and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOSA) of the simulated annealing algorithm. This method takes advantage of the Kriging model in small samples and high-dimensional nonlinear data processing capabilities and establishes a response surface model to approximate the actual limit state function. The optimization of the PSO algorithm is realized through the self-adaptive and variable probability mutation operation of the SA algorithm, which enhances the ability of the PSO algorithm to get rid of the local minimum, effectively avoids falling into the local minimum, and finally makes the calculation result tend to the global optimum. It overcomes the problems of slow convergence speed and premature maturity of traditional PSO algorithms. The correctness and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper are verified through the example analysis and the actual engineering application of a concrete arch bridge. The research results show that the method proposed in this paper has obvious advantages in sample size, calculation accuracy, and iteration times compared with the existing reliability calculation methods for concrete arch bridges. This paper provides a fast and effective method for the structural reliability calculation of concrete arch bridges.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fast generalized surrogate−assisted evolution algorithm based on a multi-strategy hybrid sparrow search algorithm (FGSAEA-MSHSSA). The proposed algorithm introduces an innovative model management approach that integrates both global and local surrogate models. The proposed algorithm constructs the global surrogate model using an ensemble surrogate method and introduces a variance and distance (VD) criterion to select appropriate individuals for exact evaluation, effectively guiding the evolutionary search process. It also proposes the concept of a population trust region to build local surrogate models, enhancing the exploration capability of FGSAEA-MSHSSA. Additionally, the top feasible mean rule (TFMR) is incorporated to maintain a balance between the feasible and infeasible regions during the search, improving the quality of feasible solutions and significantly accelerating convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other advanced algorithms on benchmark functions with varying characteristics and spring design problems. It not only significantly reduces computational costs but also greatly enhances optimization performance, with an average improvement of approximately 48.4},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have shown great potential to solve computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs). Their two key components, i.e., the optimizer and the surrogate model, both need to select solutions to promote further evolution and to update the model, respectively. However, the corresponding selection strategies are designed independently and mainly consider the predicted fitness of candidate solutions. Consequently, they can hardly complement each other well and are much likely to mislead the population evolution since the surrogate model necessarily has some prediction errors. Directing against this issue, this study proposes a unified dual-space-driven selection (DSDS) strategy and develops a new SAEA by taking differential evolution and radial basis function as the optimizer and the surrogate model, respectively. Besides the predicted fitness in objective space of candidate solutions, DSDS also considers their distribution in decision space by measuring how close they are to the geometric centers of their respective neighborhoods with a new indicator called neighborhood centrality (NC). It tries to select the solutions with good fitness and small NC values under a multi-objective sample selection framework and thus helps the resulting SAEA steadily search in multiple neighborhoods of excellent solutions. The performance of the new SAEA was extensively tested on six commonly used benchmark functions with five different dimensions from 20 to 200 as well as two typical real-word traffic signal optimization cases. Experimental results demonstrate that it possesses more competitive performance and stronger robustness than state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

This paper presents a distributionally robust iron-steel allocation (DRISA) model to obtain a robust scheduling plan, where the distribution of the pretreatment time vector is assumed to belong to an ambiguity set which contains all the distributions with given first and second moments. This model aims to minimize the production objective by determining the iron-steel allocation and the completion time of each charge, while the constraints should hold with a certain probability under the worst-case distribution. To solve problems in large-scale efficiently, a variable neighborhood algorithm is developed to obtain a near-optimal solution in a short time. Experiments based on actual production data demonstrate its efficiency. Results also show the robustness of the DRISA model, i.e., the adjustment and delay of the robust schedule derived from the DRISA model are less than the nominal one.},

This mathematical equation is a nonlinear algebraic equation that finds the path from the starting point through the obstacle to the target point by a dynamic method. A minimum value evaluation criterion is applied to optimize multiple tracing paths to find an optimal solution. The advantage of this algorithm is that it simplifies the problem by finding the differences between them through a one-dimensional search for paths that avoid obstacles in the region of the motion function. It makes decisions by numerical comparison, thus avoiding the errors associated with objective evaluation. This algorithm can be applied in the field of intelligent control and the field of driverless vehicles.

  abstract     = {Complex systems pose risks characterized by factors such as uncertainty, nonlinearity, and diversity, making traditional risk measurement methods based on a probabilistic framework inadequate. Supernetworks can effectively model complex systems, and temporal supernetworks can capture the dynamic evolution of these systems. From the perspective of network stability, supernetworks can aid in risk identification for complex systems. In this paper, an IO-SuperPageRank algorithm is proposed based on the supernetwork topological structure. This algorithm reveals network instability by calculating changes in node importance, thereby helping to identify risks in complex systems. To validate the effectiveness of this algorithm, a four-layer supernetwork composed of scale-free networks is constructed. Simulated experiments are conducted to assess the impact of changes in intralayer edge numbers, intralayer node numbers, and interlayer superedge numbers on the risk indicator IO value. Linear regression and multiple tests were used to validate these relationships. The experiments show that changes in the three network topological indicators all bring about risks, with changes in intralayer node numbers having the most significant correlation with the risk indicator IO value. Compared to traditional measures of network node centrality and connectivity, this algorithm can more accurately predict the impact of node updates on network stability. Additionally, this paper collected trade data for crude oil, chemical light oil, man-made filaments and man-made staple fibers from the UN Comtrade Database. We constructed a man-made filaments and fibers supply chain temporal supernetwork, utilizing the algorithm to identify supply chain risks from December 2020 to October 2023. The study revealed that the algorithm effectively identified risks brought about by changes in international situations such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Israel–Hamas conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This demonstrated the algorithm’s effectiveness in empirical analysis. In the future, we plan to further expand its application based on different scenarios, assess risks by analyzing changes in specific system elements, and implement effective risk intervention measures.},

  abstract     = {Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is one of the most important level-2 kernels in sparse basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS). Compared to another level-2 sparse BLAS kernel sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV), SpTRSV is in general more difficult to find high parallelism on many-core processors, such as GPUs. Nowadays, much work focuses on reducing dependencies and synchronizations in the level-set and Sync-free algorithms for SpTRSV. However, there is less work that can make good use of sparse spatial structure for SpTRSV on GPUs. In this paper, we propose a tiled algorithm called TileSpTRSV for optimizing SpTRSV on GPUs through exploiting 2D spatial structure of sparse matrices. We design two algorithm implementations, i.e., TileSpTRSV_level-set and TileSpTRSV_sync-free , for TileSpTRSV on top of level-set and Sync-free algorithms, respectively. By testing 16 representative matrices on a latest NVIDIA GPU, the experimental results show that TileSpTRSV_level-set gives on average 5.29

  abstract     = {Many-objective evolutionary algorithms often struggle to strike a balance between convergence and diversity when solving many-objective optimization problems. Consequently, an adaptive boundary-based selection many-objective evolutionary algorithm with density estimation, MaOEA/ABS-DE, is proposed. Specifically, the algorithm initially utilizes prior information regarding the adaptive estimation of the shape of the Pareto front to perform coordinate transformation on the population, thus guiding the population towards the approximate boundary of the current Pareto front. Subsequently, a novel approach for estimating the neighboring density of individuals is introduced by utilizing the distribution information of the transformed population. Furthermore, adaptive boundary-based selection and shifted-based density estimation selection strategies are designed for the environmental selection process. The environmental selection process is completed through a two-step selection. In the first step, a candidate pool is formed by selecting solutions with lower neighboring density, which aims to maintain a broad search for the population in the objective space. In the second step, the SDE is introduced to compare the convergence of individuals in the candidate pool, and those with the optimal SDE values are selected. Finally, extensive comparative experiments are conducted on two benchmark test suites, MaF (Many-objective Functions) and WFG (Walking Fish Group), as well as on two practical cases. The MaOEA/ABS-DE is compared with five representative many-objective evolutionary algorithms, including 1by1EA, NSGA-III, MaOEA-CSS, RVEA, and SPEA2 + SDE. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms or at least matches the performance of the five algorithms on 87.04},

  abstract     = {At present, China's urbanization transformation is accelerating, the construction industry is developing rapidly, and people's requirements for buildings are also increasing, which leads to the increasing energy consumption. Therefore, energy-saving construction in the construction industry is imminent. During the actual life cycle of a building project, including planning, design, construction and later operation and maintenance, energy consumption will be generated in the above processes. Based on this background, this research realized the design of intelligent building management and information system for energy conservation projects by introducing computer vision algorithm. The system is integrated with laws and regulations, economic benefits, technical steps, quality management, cost management, schedule management and other modules. The design process is relatively complex. Therefore, this work adopts modern computer vision algorithm technology and uses relevant tools to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of information in each stage of energy-saving project management process and realize information management from project approval, design, drawing review, and construction to acceptance. Finally, this paper builds system interface layer, system function layer, and database support layer. The system measurement shows that the building energy consumption can be predicted easily, accurately and stably by inputting the energy consumption data collected by each part of the target building. The system realizes the combination of qualitative and quantitative research on energy conservation regulation and improves the informatization level of China's energy conservation research and construction. This paper designs a kind of intelligent building energy-saving management system by studying computer vision algorithm.},

The method combines the advantages of the eXFAST methodology and a new procedure, which generates the set of main and complementary frequencies for the random variable vector, in order to enhance the convergence when estimating the main and the total interaction effect of models with strong nonlinearities. First, the proposed approach is benchmarked using the well-known Legendre polynomial model of order p and Sobol’s G-functions. The benchmark studies show a solid performance of the proposed method compared to Monte Carlo and the classic eXFAST algorithm without the re-sampling procedure. Secondly, the proposed approach is coupled with the finite element method with the aim to predict the dynamic instabilities of a reduced brake system consisting of a rotating disc and two flat pads. The investigations have shown that the hybrid approach estimates the main and the total interaction contributions of the instabilities with only a few stochastic iterations, which reduces considerably the computational cost of direct methods available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Gradually, the previously proposed water resource management schemes and reservoir operating policies adjusted to the historically experienced climatic conditions are losing their validity and efficacy, urging building up the models compatible with the likely climatic change conditions at the future. This paper aims at optimizing the reservoir operation under climate change conditions targeting the objectives including (1) minimizing the shortages in meeting the reservoir downstream water demands and (2) maximizing the sustainability of the reservoir storage. For evaluating the effects of the climate change, six general circulation models (GCMs) built up under the representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5) emission scenario are adopted and utilized to predict the climate variables over a 30-year planning period. To solve this problem, an improved version of our recently proposed fuzzy multi-objective particle swarm optimization (f-MOPSO) algorithm, named f-MOPSO-II, is proposed. The f-MOPSO takes a novel approach to handle multi-objective nature of the optimization problems. In this approach, the common concept of “diversity” is replaced with “extremity,” to choose the better guides of the search agents in the algorithm. The f-MOPSO-II is based on the f-MOPSO. However, it is aimed at simultaneously mitigating the f-MOPSO computational complexity and enhancing the quality of the final results presented by this algorithm. The results obtained by the f-MOPSO-II were then compared with those yielded by the popular non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). As the results suggest, the f-MOPSO-II is capable of simultaneously meeting the water demands and holding the reservoir storage sustainable, much better than the NSGA-II.},

This paper considers the parameter estimation probelm for Hammerstein nonlinear systems whose output measurements are contaminated with additive outliers. By incorporating a lasso-type penalty on the outlier vector, a regularization based least squares identification algorithm that can interactively estimate the system parameters and outliers is proposed based on the auxiliary model identification idea. To further reduce the impact of outliers on the identification effect, each observation is assigned an individual weight, which decreases as the number of iterations increases once the corresponding data is determined to be an outlier. Finally, the outliers can be excluded from the contaminated data without any prior knowledge and the estimation bias is reduced. A numerical example and a benchmark system are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Efficient simulation is crucial for the development and validation of quantum algorithms and quantum computers. This paper explores and compares various strategies to leverage different levels of parallelism to accelerate the contraction of tensor networks representing large quantum circuits. We propose a new parallel multistage algorithm based on communities. The original tensor network is partitioned into several communities, which are then contracted in parallel. The pairs of tensors of the resulting network can be contracted in parallel using a GPU. We use the Girvan–Newman algorithm to obtain the communities and the contraction plans. We compare the new algorithm with two other parallelisation strategies: one based on contracting all the pairs of tensors in the GPU and another one that uses slicing to cut some indexes of the tensor network and then MPI processes to contract the resulting slices in parallel. The new parallel algorithm gets the best results with different well-known quantum circuits with a high degree of entanglement, including random quantum circuits. In conclusion, the results show that the main factor that limits the simulation is the space cost. However, the parallel multistage algorithm manages to reduce the cost of sequential simulation for circuits with a high number of qubits and allows simulating larger circuits.},

The goal is to update the uncertain parameters of two behavioral material models applied to the Finite Element Model (elastic moduli, mass densities, constraints, and boundary conditions) to minimize the discrepancy between experimental and numerical dynamic features. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the definition of a metamodel to reduce the computational strain and try to define the necessary parameters to use for the calibration process. Due to the high nonlinear dependency of the objective function of this optimization problem on the parameters, and the likely possibility to get trapped in local minima, a machine learning approach was meant. A fully automated Finite Element Model updating procedure based on genetic algorithms and global optimization is used, leading to tower uncertain parameters identification. The results allowed to create a reference numerical replica of the structure in its actual health state and to assess its dynamic performances allowing better control over their future evolution.},

  abstract     = {In real-world problems, engineering data often suffer from outliers due to deficiencies in measurement techniques, recording errors, or other reasons. In this work, a robust prediction method is proposed based on the Kriging method and fuzzy c-means algorithm. An outlier detection strategy is designed based on the fuzzy c-means algorithm, in which Kriging method is used to evaluate the relationship between the input and output. The membership of each training sample is calculated based on the prediction error of the Kriging model of each cluster and is used to judge whether the training sample is an outlier. The detected outliers are removed from the training samples, and then the remaining training samples are used to construct the final prediction model. The effect of the parameters of the proposed method on its performance is studied through an one-dimensional and a four-dimensional numerical problem, and ten benchmark functions are used to test its performance thoroughly. The results indicate that the proposed method produces much better performance in terms of outlier detection accuracy and prediction accuracy than the conventional outlier detection method and the Kriging method. Similar results can be found in the experiments on engineering problems. The proposed method is applied to model and analyze the operation data of the cleaning device of a combine harvester. The effect of the operation parameters of the cleaning device on the grain impurity ratio is studied, and the operation parameters of the cleaning device are optimized based on the prediction model of the proposed method. The analysis and optimization results provide a reference for the operation and control of the cleaning device of a combine harvester.},

  abstract     = {Parameter identification in a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) entails the application of optimization algorithms to ascertain the optimal unknown variables essential for crafting an accurate model that predicts fuel-cell performance. These parameters are typically not included in the manufacturer’s datasheet and must be identified to ensure precise modeling and forecasting of fuel cell behavior. This paper introduces a recently developed hybrid algorithm (Aquila Optimizer Arithmetic Algorithm Optimization (AOAAO)) that enhances the AO and AAO algorithm’s efficiency through a novel mutation strategy, aimed at determining seven unknown parameters of a PEMFC during the optimization process. These parameters function as decision variables, and the objective function aimed for minimization is the sum square error (SSE) between the predicted and actual measured cell voltages. AOAAO demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving an SSE minimum in comparison to other compared algorithm. AOAAO’s robustness was validated through extensive testing with six commercially available PEMFCs, including BCS 500 W-PEM, 500 W SR-12PEM, Nedstack PS6 PEM, H-12 PEM, HORIZON 500 W PEM, and a 250 W-stack, across twelve case studies derived from various operational conditions detailed in manufacturers’ datasheets. For each datasheet, both Current–Voltage (I/V) and Power–Voltage (P/V) characteristics of the PEMFCs scenarios closely aligned with those observed in experimental data, affirming AOAAO’s superior accuracy, robustness, and time efficiency for real-time fuel cell modeling. In terms of computational efficiency, AOAAO runtime is significantly faster than all compared algorithms, demonstrating an efficiency improvement of approximately 98},

Motivated by the famous DIRECT (DIviding RECTangles), a new HALRECT (HALving RECTangles) algorithm is introduced. A new deterministic approach combines halving (bisection) with a new multi-point sampling scheme in contrast to trisection and midpoint sampling used in most existing DIRECT -type algorithms. A new partitioning and sampling scheme uses more comprehensive information on the objective function. Four different strategies for selecting potentially optimal hyper-rectangles are introduced to exploit the objective function’s information effectively. The original algorithm HALRECT and other introduced HALRECT variations (twelve in total) are tested and compared with the other twelve recently introduced DIRECT -type algorithms on 96 box-constrained benchmark functions from DIRECTGOLib v1.1 , and 96 perturbed their versions. Extensive experimental results are advantageous compared to state-of-the-art DIRECT -type global optimization. New HALRECT approaches offer high robustness across problems of different degrees of complexity, varying from simple—uni-modal and low dimensional to complex—multi-modal and higher dimensionality.},

This study proposes a novel forecasting framework that fuses modal decomposition with the advanced PatchTST model. Initially, the Spearman correlation coefficient is employed to identify features strongly associated with battery capacity. The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) method is then used to break down the raw capacity sequence into a set of intrinsic mode functions. To enhance decomposition quality, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) optimizes the number of modes K and penalty factor α by minimizing mean envelope entropy. The selected features and decomposed components are subsequently input into a PatchTST network, whose hyperparameters are tuned via the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), to predict battery RUL. Experimental validation on the NASA Battery dataset and NASA Randomized Battery Usage Dataset demonstrates that the proposed WOA-VMD-SSA-PatchTST model consistently outperforms baseline models, including CNN, GRU and PatchTST, achieving superior prediction accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {The complex and variable nature of shadows in natural environments-including diverse shapes, intensities, and intricate scene compositions-presents major challenges for accurate shadow removal. To address these challenges, this study introduces MGME-ShadowNet, a novel shadow removal algorithm designed to enhance image quality by restoring details within shadowed regions, thereby improving the performance of subsequent image processing tasks. MGME-ShadowNet integrates a MaskGuideAttention mechanism and a Mask-Aware Enhancement Module (MAEM) within a diffusion model framework, enabling it to handle both soft and hard shadows, especially in complex scenes. The MaskGuideAttention mechanism adaptively adjusts the contributions of self-attention and spatial attention through learnable parameters and allocates attention based on shadow masks. Meanwhile, the MAEM module refines initial shadow masks generated by the shadow detection network, improving their accuracy through dilated convolutions and pyramid pooling. Experimental evaluations on the SRD dataset demonstrate that MGME-ShadowNet achieves improved performance compared to existing methods, with a 2.09 dB increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in shadowed regions and a 0.56-point reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) for shadow quality, surpassing the performance of ShadowDiffusion. These results confirm MGME-ShadowNet’s effectiveness in handling complex shadow scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Donghui-Wang/MGMEShadowNet.},

  abstract     = {Based on double-compressed sampling, a hyperspectral spectral unmixing algorithm (SU_DCS) is proposed, which could directly complete the endmember extraction and abundance estimation. On the basis of the linear mixed model (LMM), we designed spatial and spectral sampling matrices, obtained spatial and spectral measurement data, and constructed a joint unmixing model containing endmember and abundance information. By using operator separation and Lagrangian multiplier algorithm, the endmember matrix, abundance matrix and remixing image can be quickly obtained by matrix operation. The parameters of the unmixing algorithm, including regularization parameter, convergence threshold and spatial sampling rate, are determined using synthetic simulated hyperspectral data. The proposed algorithm is applied to two kinds of real hyperspectral data, with or without ground truth, in order to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm. Firstly, we provide the performance of the algorithm on real datasets without ground truth. Compared with algorithm VCA_FCLS and algorithm CPPCA_VCA_FCLS, the endmember spectral curve extracted by the proposed SU_DCS is almost consistent with that obtained by VCA_FCLS, and is more smooth than that of obtained by CPPCA_VCA_FCLS. Additionally, the abundance estimation map estimated by the SU_DCS has consistency with the results obtained by VCA_FCLS. Moreover, the proposed SU_DCS has higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for remixing images with higher computational efficiency. Secondly, we provide the performance of the proposed algorithm on four real datasets with ground truth, including dataset Cuprite, dataset Samson, dataset Jasper and dataset Urban. We provide the results of endmember extraction and abundance estimation from the compressed data under different sampling rate conditions. The extracted endmember maintains good consistency with the true spectral curves, and the estimated abundance map can also maintain good spatial consistency with the ground truth. The comparison results with other four comparative algorithms also indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain relatively accurate endmembers and abundance information from compressed data, the reliability and validity of the proposed algorithm have been proved. In summary, the main innovation of the proposed algorithm is that it can extract endmembers and estimate abundance with high accuracy from a small amount of measurement data.},

The proposed CSMOEA adopts an adaptive clustering strategy to divide the current population into good and bad groups, and the clustering centers in the design space are obtained, respectively. Then, a bi-level sampling strategy is proposed to select the best samples in both the design and objective space, using distance to the clustering centers and approximated objective values of radial basis functions. The effectiveness of CSMOEA is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 21 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show high efficiency and a good balance between convergence and diversity. Additionally, CSMOEA is applied to the shape optimization of blend-wing-body underwater gliders with 14 decision variables and two objectives, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving real-world engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {As a critical component of rotating machinery, the operating status of rolling bearings is not only related to significant economic interests but also has a far-reaching impact on social security. Hence, ensuring an effective diagnosis of faults in rolling bearings is paramount in maintaining operational integrity. This paper proposes an intelligent bearing fault diagnosis method that improves classification accuracy using a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and adaptive hierarchical hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (AHHKELM). First, a hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (HKELM) is initially constructed, leveraging SDAE’s deep network architecture for automatic feature extraction. The hybrid kernel functions address the limitations of single kernel functions by effectively capturing both linear and nonlinear patterns in the data. Subsequently, the hierarchical hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (HHKELM) is refined through an enhanced Aquila Optimizer (AO) algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the kernel hyperparameter combination. The AO algorithm is further enhanced by incorporating chaos mapping, implementing a refined balanced search strategy, and fine-tuning parameter 
$$G_2$$
 , which collectively improve its ability to escape local optima and conduct global searches, thus strengthening the robustness of the model during parameter optimization. Experimental results on the CWRU , MFPT and JNU datasets demonstrate that stacked denoising autoencoder-adaptive hierarchical hybrid kernel extreme learning machine (SDAE-AHHKELM) has better fault classification accuracy, robustness, and generalization than KELM and other methods.},

  abstract     = {Computer Numerical Control milling is a critical technique in advanced manufacturing, yet ensuring consistent surface quality remains challenging due to dynamic variations in temperature, force, and other uncertain factors such as material properties and environmental noise. Robust optimization offers a promising approach to mitigate these uncertainties, enhancing product quality and precision, which holds significant potential for advancing machining technologies of Computer Numerical Control. In this study, 7075 aluminum alloy was selected as the workpiece material, and a comprehensive set of 25 × 4 face milling experiments was conducted. Take the spindle speed (n), feed per tooth ( 
$${\text{f}}_{\text{z}}$$
 f z ), milling depth ( 
$${\text{a}}_{\text{p}}$$
 a p ) and milling width ( 
$${\text{a}}_{\text{e}}$$
 a e ) as input variables, and the mean and variance of surface roughness as output variables. Use stochastic kriging methods to reasonably characterize the relationship between input and output. To achieve a combination of milling parameters that ensures both minimal surface roughness and high robustness, the Mean-Square Error criterion was utilized to integrate the mean and variance models constructed through stochastic kriging. Additionally, the hunter-prey optimization algorithm was enhanced by introducing Latin hypercube sampling and a nonlinear dynamic update strategy. Then, the improved algorithm was applied to the established Mean-Square Error model, and the milling parameter combination with better surface roughness and robustness was obtained. The findings of this study not only provide a practical framework for optimizing machining parameters of Computer Numerical Control but also contribute to the broader field of robust optimization in manufacturing. By addressing the challenges posed by uncertainties, this research supports the development of more reliable and efficient machining processes, aligning with the goals of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing. The proposed model is not limited to manufacturing; its robust optimization framework is adaptable to diverse fields such as aerospace, energy systems, and biomedical engineering, offering reliable solutions under uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Recently, image encryption methods using compressed sensing (CS) technology for visual security have gained widespread attention. These schemes simultaneously encrypt and compress the plain image at one time, and then embed the encrypted image into a new carrier image (i.e., cover image), making the secret cipher image better be concealed in a visually secure manner. However, considering reconstruction quality and embedding efficiency, new hiding algorithm should still be studied further for improvement. To address these problems, a visual image hiding algorithm is presented in this paper, i.e., ViIHA. First, a pseudo-random sequence generation method using restricted Boltzmann machine is designed to improve the randomness of keystream. Second, a measurement matrix and a parallel CS technique are constructed to enhance execution efficiency. Next, a random dynamic embedding strategy is proposed to improve data embedding capacity while ensuring the visual quality for cover image. Finally, simulation experiments show that ViIHA has high security and strong robustness. Compared with some current algorithms, the proposed ViIHA can achieve a better quality for both reconstructed image and cover image, demonstrating a good performance.},

At the first level, two subspaces are created to accelerate the local search. Subspace1 is a promising region determined by fuzzy c-means clustering method, and Subspace2 is a promising region around the current best solution. Subsequently, the presented local exploitation using multi-spaces reduction is carried out to alternately achieve more promising points in the original global space, Subspace1 and Subspace2. Furthermore, the estimated mean square error of Kriging will be maximized for exploring the sparsely sampled regions, once CLEGE algorithm falls into the local optimum.

Exploring the optimization and improvement of the prediction model to obtain the optimal solution is an urgent problem. In this paper, based on genetic algorithm and data mining technology, a genetic algorithm model based on adaptive improvement is proposed. Through linear adaptive optimization, the optimal solution of complex problems is obtained. When estimating parameters, EM algorithm is used to estimate, so that the final effect of model fusion can reach the expectation. At the same time, it integrates data mining technology, Borderline STATE EasyEnsemble sampling method and SVM intelligent technology to build an optimized comprehensive risk early warning model, which realizes the automatic integration and prediction of financial risks. The adjusted mathematical model is better than the single technical model. This study verified that the prediction ability of the improved model for minority samples has been greatly improved.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA) prevails in the optimization of computationally expensive problems. However, existing SAEAs confront low efficiency in the resolution of high-dimensional problems characterized by multiple local optima and multivariate coupling. To this end, this paper offers a dual-drive collaboration surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (DDCSAEA) by coupling feature reduction and reconstruction, which coordinates two unsupervised feature learning techniques, i.e., principal component analysis and autoencoder, in tandem. DDCSAEA creates a low-dimensional solution space by downscaling the target high-dimensional space via principal component analysis and collects promising candidates in the reduced space by collaborating a surrogate-assisted evolutionary sampling with differential mutation. An autoencoder is used to perform the feature reconstruction on the collected candidates for infill-sampling in the target high-dimensional space to sequentially refine the neighborhood landscapes of the optimal solution. Experimental results reveal that DDCSAEA has stronger convergence performance and optimization efficiency against eight state-of-the-art SAEAs on high-dimensional benchmark problems within 200 dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, many computer vision tasks, including object detection, recognition, and segmentation, have been accomplished using deep learning models. However, certain computer vision algorithms, such as affine transformation, image blur, edge detection, and histogram equalization, remain irreplaceable in deep learning models. To accelerate the execution times of these computer vision algorithms, in this paper, these algorithms are implemented and optimized on the Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM) and a very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture based on the RISC-V instruction set. The TVM is a deep learning compiler framework on which deep learning tasks can be optimized across various hardware platforms through multiple levels of optimization. In the VLIW architecture, groups of instructions are concurrently executed, thereby leveraging instruction-level parallelism to improve performance. Computer vision applications, which are largely composed of fixed operations, are frequently optimized by deploying these applications on digital signal processors (DSPs) with VLIW architectures. Thus, we propose a 6-way VLIW architecture composed of two integer units, two floating-point or double-precision units, and two vector units on the basis of the RISC-V vector extension(RVV) for VLIW architectures. In our research, we use TVM tensor expressions to implement computer vision algorithms and optimize performance via the MetaSchedule for the proposed VLIW RVV architecture. In our experiments using the Gem5 simulator, the proposed VLIW architecture demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving up to 26.08 times faster execution in histogram equalization than the RV64 baseline. We evaluated the performance of four computer vision algorithms across various CPU architectures and memory configurations, highlighting the effectiveness of combining traditional algorithms with machine learning compiler frameworks and specialized hardware to increase computational efficiency.},

However, when policy sets defined by the XACML become large and complex, the policy evaluation time increases significantly. In order to improve policy evaluation performance, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the DPCA (Density Peak Cluster Algorithm) to improve the clustering effect on large-scale complex policy sets. Combined with this algorithm, an efficient policy evaluation engine, named DPEngine, is proposed to speed up policy matching and reduce the policy evaluation time. We compare the policy evaluation time of DPEngine with the Sun PDP, HPEngine, XEngine and SBA-XACML. The experiment results show that (1) when the number of requests reaches 10,000, the DPEngine evaluation time on a large-scale policy set with 100,000 rules is approximately 2.23},

  abstract     = {Improving the effectiveness and scalability of implicit algorithms has long been a subject that attracted scientific computing researchers. The generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method is one of the efficient algorithms employed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). However, due to the inherent sequential properties, GMRES encountered difficulties in achieving high parallel computing performance. Diverse HPC architecture trends also introduce challenges in algorithm migration. In this work, based on the separation of concerns thought, a performance-portable parallel GMRES algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve compressible Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids in parallel on different platforms. First, the Jacobian evaluation for the GMRES algorithm is improved. This method explicitly calculates a more accurate Jacobian matrix derived analytically instead of using the matrix-free method to enhance the convergence. In addition, it is convenient to call the highly optimized linear algebra libraries to achieve performance and portability, manually implementing the high-level Jacobian matrix computation and leaving the rest algorithm part and low-level optimization on target architecture to the library. Combined with a fine-grained parallel LU-SGS (lower-upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel) preconditioner, the algorithm can run efficiently on multi-core or many-core architectures such as GPUs. The proposed method has been used to compute some typical compressible flow configurations. Experimental results show that the proposed method has obvious advantages over the commonly used implicit algorithms like matrix-free GMRES and LU-SGS in terms of convergence and portability of parallel performance.},

For the taxonomy development, data from 101 blockchain start-ups serves as a basis for empirical validation. Using hierarchical clustering and the k-means method, seven archetypes that sharpen the understanding of how blockchain solutions affect business models in enterprise networks and enable new business models are derived.

  abstract     = {The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) have engendered an increased penetration of cyber-physical systems such as internet-enabled devices and sensors for surveillance and management applications. This has posed an increased risk of attacks in these devices and networks by malevolent agents. Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm that incorporates the concept of Social Networking into the Internet of Things that paved the way to an area called Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) that is capable of autonomously establishing social relationships among other network participants for the overall system improvement. Due to the ad-hoc nature of the environment, it is hard to ensure the trustworthiness of the nodes to rely on the opinions, messages, and credibility of the message senders. We propose a Blockchain based reputation management system using Bayesian Inference approach for estimating the posterior probability of trustworthiness of each decision-making node in the network based on the decisions on incidents concerning the hypothesis. A dynamic weight learning mechanism of nodes and events is proposed for an efficient decision system. The proposed decision fusion algorithm is a novel voting mechanism based on the reputation of the node and the importance of the event. This approach uses Blockchain as a solution for identity management for node authorization and access control, and also for distributed storage of node reputation scores. The decision strategy of the proposed work outperforms other decision approaches such as simple majority voting, weighted voting, fuzzy rule-based inference, etc. The proposed approach out performs the state of the art trust management algorithms as discussed in results section, on the degree of punishment the propose algorithm offers to malicious activity.},

  abstract     = {Drug traceability is a critical process involving monitoring and validation of the origin, quality, and safety of pharmaceutical products throughout their supply chain to prevent the distribution of counterfeit, substandard, or expired drugs that could harm patients. Traditional centralized solutions for drug traceability, relying on intermediaries and central authorities, introduce risks of data manipulation, corruption, and single points of failure. This work presents the design and implementation of a novel solution for decentralized drug traceability based on blockchain technology and on a reputation mechanism that operates on top of a trustworthy decentralized knowledge base, thus integrating three core technologies: blockchain, semantic, and reputation methods. Blockchain technologies ensure transparent and secure supply chain processes while providing a trustworthy estimation of the reputation of supply chain participants. Semantic technologies address drug data heterogeneity by ensuring interoperability and creating mappings between various data sources, including verifying the identities of the various users. Additionally, the reputation mechanism promotes transparency and accountability, as stakeholders contribute feedback on drug quality, authenticity, and reliability. This fosters a culture of trust and reliability, offering the drug supply chain an effective tool for continuous improvement and informed decision-making based on aggregated feedback, ultimately enhancing overall quality and safety throughout the distribution network. The design and implementation of the system, along with several evaluations, show the feasibility of the new semantic blockchain system in real-world scenarios and the improvement of the entities with a high reputation score. Our solution is more trustworthy, discouraging fraudulent activities as security is based on the various properties included in the semantic model.},

The modelling is built upon the definition of a UML profile, which is able to capture transaction-oriented information. The analysis is based on existing formal analysis tools. In particular, the paper considers the Tweetchain protocol, a recent proposal that leverages online social networks, i.e., Twitter, for extending blockchain to domains with small-value transactions, such as IoT. A specialized textual notation is added to the UML profile to capture features of this protocol. Furthermore, a model transformation is defined to generate a Tamarin model, from the UML models, via an intermediate well-known notation, i.e., the Alice    Bob notation. Finally, Tamarin Prover is used to verify the model of the protocol against some security properties. This work extends a previous one, where the Tamarin formal models were generated by hand. A comparison on the analysis results, both under the functional and non-functional aspects, is reported here too.},

The blockchain has the potential to facilitate responsible sourcing appropriately, compliance with weather requirements, and sustainable delivery chains. The purpose of this study is to address the hassle of managing conservatism when approaching era adoption and to explore the performance enhancements in blockchain-generated implementations. To achieve this goal, we introduce a scientific approach aimed at studying the outcomes of various factors in the adoption process in the blockchain era and verifying their impact on the overall performance of the delivery chain. Furthermore, a team of multidisciplinary professionals will establish causal relationships among these elements through a consensus-based approach. Ultimately, fuzzy reasoning tools can be used to determine the relative weights between identified factors and delivery chain performance goals. We will assemble causal representations of diagnoses using a dense scientific map model and dynamically generate scenarios for each.

This paper employs mean–variance theory and Bayesian method to construct a blockchain-supported maritime supply chain model, and examines the port service price, port emission reduction investment level, freight price, shipping quantity and the expected utilities of both parties. We contribute to clarifying the emission reduction and coordination in the blockchain-supported maritime supply chain with risk-averse participants, and identify the specific conditions for blockchain adoption. A key finding is that blockchain adoption conditions are not only related to the costs involved, but also depend on the future direction of shipping market demand. In addition, we are the first to design both cost-sharing and revenue-sharing contracts in a blockchain-supported maritime supply chain for emission reduction, and to identify the conditions under which these contracts are coordinated. We find that although both contracts improve the profitability of ports and shipping companies under certain conditions, each has its own merits. Furthermore, we reveal the effects of the relevant parameters, and assess that the sensitivity of port service price and shipping price to blockchain unit operating cost is not intuitively monotonic, but is influenced by the low-carbon preference degree of shippers. The research results have critical contributions and practical implications for blockchain adoption and the optimization of emission reduction in the shipping operations.

In the proposed architecture, we have newly designed blocks and gateway nodes, which improve the security and credibility of smart grid device identity authentication. Then we design a Computing Balance based Exchange (CBE) algorithm to improve the interaction efficiency between smart grid devices. In addition, the multi-layer smart contract based on smart grid is proposed to solve the problems of lack of mutual trust and information sharing between smart grid devices. Finally, the blockchain-based smart grid security architecture and multi-layer smart contract can achieve secure interaction and efficient identity authentication among smart grid devices.},

As these systems are often safety-critical, formal methods to ensure safety, performance and resilience are highly desirable, in particular also in the presence of unknown and uncertain environments. The semantics of Simulink is, however, only informally defined. In this paper, we present a modular approach to transform stochastic Simulink models to stochastic hybrid automata (SHA). Our key idea is threefold: 1) We provide transformation rules that map Simulink blocks to SHA templates, 2) we map distributed signal flow to a discrete event synchronization mechanism, and 3) we present a parallel composition algorithm. Our transformation gives us access to established quantitative analysis techniques such as reachability analysis and statistical model checking. We show the feasibility of our approach using a temperature control system with a stochastic failure and repair model.},

In this paper, a calibrated finite element model (FEM) is developed to evaluate the dynamic response due to aeolian vibrations of a single OPGW (Optical Ground Wire) cable with Stockbridge dampers. The model included the geometric, material, and damping characteristics of the OPGW cable and dampers, calibrated in previous work. The wind power input was simulated using a stochastic wind model based on Wiener processes, which allowed for a more realistic representation than deterministic models available in the literature. In addition, a Polynomial Chaos-Kriging (PCK) metamodel of the FEM model was constructed to reduce the computational cost of the model evaluation. The uncertainty of the wind load was propagated through the metamodel to obtain the distributions of the variables regarding the dynamic response, including the antinode and bending amplitudes, as a function of the Von Karman vortex shedding frequency. This was achieved using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, in which a large number of random simulations based on the wind model probability distribution were generated. The results were aggregated to obtain the distributions of the variables of interest. Field measurements were recorded with specific equipment to validate the simulation results. The results obtained in this study provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of cable-damper systems under aeolian vibrations, which are of great importance in their robust design.},

The results show that the overall TFP of knowledge transfer at the university level in China has been improving. The increase in technical efficiency is the primary reason for this phenomenon. The output elasticity of R   D capital input is much larger than that of R   D labor input, indicating that currently, knowledge transfer is still driven by capital. This finding is particularly clear in 211-Project universities. R   D labor in the knowledge transfer process receives more preference in universities (especially non-211-Project universities) in the later period (i.e., 2012–2016). Therefore, the government should encourage the enthusiasm of researchers and improve the substantial contribution of R   D labor, thus facilitating an improvement in the subsequent knowledge transfer performance.},

  abstract     = {This study suggests a stochastic model for time series of daily zonal (circumpolar) mean stratospheric temperature at a given pressure level. It can be seen as an extension of previous studies which have developed stochastic models for surface temperatures. The proposed model is a combination of a deterministic seasonality function and a Lévy-driven multidimensional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, which is a mean-reverting stochastic process. More specifically, the deseasonalized temperature model is an order 4 continuous-time autoregressive model, meaning that the stratospheric temperature is modeled to be directly dependent on the temperature over four preceding days, while the model’s longer-range memory stems from its recursive nature. This study is based on temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis model product. The residuals of the autoregressive model are well represented by normal inverse Gaussian-distributed random variables scaled with a time-dependent volatility function. A monthly variability in speed of mean reversion of stratospheric temperature is found, hence suggesting a generalization of the fourth-order continuous-time autoregressive model. A stochastic stratospheric temperature model, as proposed in this paper, can be used in geophysical analyses to improve the understanding of stratospheric dynamics. In particular, such characterizations of stratospheric temperature may be a step towards greater insight in modeling and prediction of large-scale middle atmospheric events, such as sudden stratospheric warming. Through stratosphere–troposphere coupling, the stratosphere is hence a source of extended tropospheric predictability at weekly to monthly timescales, which is of great importance in several societal and industry sectors.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic programming has been widely used in various application scenarios and theoretical research works. However, these excellent methods depend on specific explicit probability modeling with complete knowledge of uncertainty, which is very limited in practical problem since there is usually no way to abstract complex uncertainties into the commonly used known probability models. In this paper, a novel generative model named the Adaptive Discrete Approximation Rejection Sampling is proposed for stochastic programming with incomplete knowledge of uncertainty, which can not only simulate uncertain scenarios from a complex explicit probability model that cannot meet the constraints of existing sampling methods, but also even simulate scenarios from a sample set related to uncertainty when the specific explicit probability model of uncertainty is missing or unavailable. The method is to establish the easy-to-sample proposal distribution by approximately transforming the complex hard-to-sample target probability model, to make the proposal distribution close enough to the target distribution, so as to achieve an efficient sampling while ensuring the performance of the model. On this basis, combining the Monte Carlo method and heuristic optimization, an uncertain optimization model for stochastic programming with incomplete knowledge of uncertainty is further constructed, to solve the unavailability of the existing stochastic programming methods in the absence of explicit probability model of uncertainty. Experimental results show the advantages of the proposed method in terms of applicability, adaptability, accuracy, efficiency and model performance.},

  abstract     = {We here study the effects of stochastic resetting and roughness on the transport and diffusion of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a biased and rough periodic potential in a Gaussian environment. It is found that the increase of the stochastic resetting leads to the appearance of ratchet effect first and it then disappears. This is therefore a reentrance phenomenon. The results also show that roughness and noise weaken ratchet effect, but do not lead to it. The velocity probability distribution is used to interpret the underlying mechanisms, revealing that stochastic resetting breaks the certain symmetry of the system. We also study diffusion showing that with time evolution, the system undergoes subdiffusion first, then superdiffusion, and normal diffusion finally. Moreover, stochastic resetting enhances diffusion, whereas roughness weakens it. Our results provide a valuable way of tuning transport and diffusion of Brownian particle by manipulating stochastic resetting and roughness. This may have wide potential applications in many fields, such as biology, physics, and chemistry.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates polynomial chaos methods for the linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by a special type of colored noises, i.e., the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) noise. Unlike the study for the SPDEs driven by white noises, the stochastic analysis for colored noises suffers from great difficulties due to the lack of orthogonality among the “basis” functions. We take special care for such scenario and prove the existence and uniqueness of the chaos solution and establish the convergence analysis of the truncated numerical solutions. We show that the truncation error exhibits exponential convergence in the expansion order and cubic convergence in the number of random variables. This improved convergence rate, surpassing the linear rate described in Lototsky and Stemmann (Q Appl Math 66(3):499–520, 2008), underscores the significance of our findings. Moreover, we consider first-order differential operators as the coefficients of noises, which are more challenging in analysis. Our study also extends the numerical study in Chen et al. (Stoch Partial Differ Equ Anal Comput 7(1):1–39, 2019) for SPDEs driven by white noises of various distributions to a more general type of noise. The results can provide useful guidance for distribution-free SPDEs driven by colored noise of various distributions. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical findings and to illustrate different convergence rates for commutative noises and noncommutative noises.},

  abstract     = {Purpose Aiming at the output saturation problem of the classical tristable stochastic resonance (CTSR) system, stochastic resonance of an unsaturated piecewise tristable system driven by a periodic forcing and Gaussian white noise is investigated. Methods The dimensionality of the six-type function is reduced to four-type and quadratic function. The potential function and mean first passage time (MFPT) is analyzed, and then the spectral amplification (SA) formula of the system is derived. The fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is utilized to carry out the numerical simulation. Finally, the proposed system is introduced into fault detection. Results In this work, the potential feld structure of the proposed system is discussed. The MFPT and SA derived and the influence of the parameters on the proposed system is discussed. The influence of output saturation on weak signal detection performance under strong noise is compared. Conclusions Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that the unsaturated piecewise system has much better anti-noise performance and frequency spectrum amplification factor. Bearing fault diagnosis results show that the fault frequency can be more accurately identified by the unsaturated piecewise tristable system and the characteristic signal’s energy can be enhanced more. The theoretical basis and reference value of the system are provided for further application in practical engineering testing.},

  abstract     = {Industrial development has made air pollution increasingly severe, and many respiratory diseases are closely related to air quality in terms of infection and transmission. In this work, we used the classic stochastic susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model to reflect the spread of respiratory disease, coupled with the diffusion process of air pollutants to the infectious disease model, and we investigated the impact of various environmental noises on the process of disease transmission and air pollutant diffusion. The value of this study lies in two aspects. Mathematically, we define threshold R 1 s $\mathcal{R}_{1}^{s}$ for extinction and threshold R 2 s $\mathcal{R}_{2}^{s}$ for persistence of the disease in the stochastic model ( R 2 s < R 1 s $\mathcal{R}_{2}^{s}<\mathcal{R}_{1}^{s}$ ) when the parameters are constant, and we show that (i) when R 1 s $\mathcal{R}_{1}^{s}$ is less than 1, the disease will go to stochastic extinction; (ii) when R 2 s $\mathcal{R}_{2}^{s}$ is larger than 1, the disease will persist almost surely and the model has a unique ergodic stationary distribution; (iii) when R 1 s $\mathcal{R}_{1}^{s}$ is larger than 1 and R 2 s $\mathcal{R}_{2}^{s}$ is less than 1, the extinction of the disease has randomness, which is demonstrated through numerical experiments. In addition, we derive the exact expression of the probability density function of the stationary distribution by solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation under the condition of disease persistence and analyze the effects of random noises on stationary distribution characteristics and the disease extinction. Epidemiologically, the change of the concentration of air pollutants affects the conditions for disease extinction and persistence. The increase in the inflow of pollutants and the increase in the clearance rate have negative and positive impacts on the spread of diseases, respectively. We found that an increase in random noise intensity will increase the variance, reduce the kurtosis of distribution, which is not conducive to predicting and controlling the development status of the disease; however, large random noise intensity can also increase the probability of disease extinction and accelerates disease extinction. We further investigate the dynamic of the stochastic model, assuming that the inflow rate switches between two levels by numerical experiments. The results show that the random noise has a significant impact on disease extinction. The data fitting of the switching model shows that the model can effectively depict the relationship and changes in trends between air pollution and diseases.},

This paper presents a novel stochastic-geometrical modeling framework for object pose estimation based on observing multiple feature points. This framework utilizes mixture models for feature point densities in object space and for interpreting real measurements. Advantages are the avoidance to resolve individual feature correspondences and to incorporate correct stochastic dependencies in multi-view applications. First, the general modeling framework is presented, second, a general algorithm for pose estimation is derived, and third, two example models (camera and lateration setup) are presented. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of this modeling and general algorithm by presenting four simulation scenarios for three observation systems, including the dependence on measurement resolution, object deformations and measurement noise. Probabilistic modeling utilizing mixture models shows the potential for accurate and robust pose estimations while avoiding the correspondence problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of optimal Construction Supply Chain (CSC) design and integration in deterministic and stochastic environments by providing a family of models for the optimization of a dynamic, multi-product, multi-site contractor-led CSC. With the objective of minimizing the total CSC cost, optimal decisions are made on network design, production, inventory holding and transportation, while also considering discounts for bulk purchases, logistics centers, on-site shortages and an inventory-preparation phase. The models integrate the operations of temporal and project-based supply chains into a sustainable network with repetitive flows, large scope contracts and economies of scale to provide the main contractor with a versatile optimization framework which can account for different levels of uncertainty. The novelty of this paper lies in providing a flexible integrative optimization CSC tool that accounts for multiple CSC actors (suppliers and/or logistics centers), projects, products, time periods, operations, and different decision-making environments depending on the nature of the problem and the risk-attitude of the decision maker. This paper contributes to the fast-growing research field of stochastic CSC optimization showcasing stochastic transitions of a mixed-integer linear programming model to chance-constrained programming and two-stage programming and incorporating uncertainties with different types of probability distributions or scenarios, and even interdependent uncertainties—approaches that have not been explored extensively in the CSC context. The results reveal that the stochastic approaches sacrifice the minimum cost of deterministic solutions having average settings to obtain robust well-hedged solutions over the possible parameter variations and that the selection of a suitable method for modeling uncertainty is context-dependent.},

In this paper we introduce a class of rotating shallow water models which are stochastically perturbed in order to incorporate model uncertainty into the underlying system. The stochasticity is chosen in a judicious way, by following the principles of location uncertainty, as introduced in Mémin (Geophys Astrophys Fluid Dyn 108(2):119–146, 2014). We prove that the resulting equation is part of a class of stochastic partial differential equations that have unique maximal strong solutions. The methodology is based on the construction of an approximating sequence of models taking value in an appropriately chosen finite-dimensional Littlewood-Paley space. Finally, we show that a distinguished element of this class of stochastic partial differential equations has a global weak solution.},

Based on stochastic analysis tools, algebraic graph theory, and Lyapunov function method, the containment protocols based the relative states measurement with multiplicative noises are developed to guarantee the mean square and almost sure containment. Moreover, the sufficient conditions and necessary conditions related to the control gains are derived for achieving mean square and almost sure containment. It is also shown that multiplicative noises may works positively for the almost sure containment of the first-order multi-agent systems.

  abstract     = {The correct operation of safety-critical distributed embedded systems is crucial. Following a model-driven approach, the relevant system aspects must be captured and rigorous ideally fully-automatic analysis of (probabilistic) timed safety properties must be supported. Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) support the modeling of such systems and analysis of such properties via model checking or simulation. However, they only support the modeling of probabilistic choice with a fixed numbers of outcomes and non-deterministic timing delays via timing constraints limiting applicability (descriptive expressiveness) and usefulness (precision of analysis results). To remedy this drawback of PTGTSs, we (a) extend PTGTSs to Stochastic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (STGTSs) integrating discrete/continuous random variables to capture stochastic behavior and (b) outline an adaptation of PTGTS model checking for STGTSs to enable analysis w.r.t. probabilistic timed safety properties. Relying on a running example in which shuttles navigating on a track topology must avoid derailing, we exemplify STGTS support for modeling and analysis.},

Note that above engineering applications have the characteristic of hysteresis, which results in degraded performance for most existing PPC schemes. This paper investigates the problem of PPC for stochastic nonlinear systems with hysteresis input. Different from existing PPC schemes, an improved finite-time performance function is introduced to select the desired convergence time flexibly. By incorporating an intermediate parameter into the controller, a novel control design framework is presented to adaptively compensate hysteresis input. Besides, the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the systems are approximated by fuzzy logic systems, and the computational complexity problem is reduced by using dynamic surface control technique. Then, the proposed control scheme ensures that tracking error converges to the specific region, which can be set arbitrarily within the physical limitations. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Daylight plays a major role in the wake/sleep cycle in humans. Indeed, the wake/sleep system stems from biological systems that follow a circadian rhythm determined by the light/dark alternation. The oscillations can be modeled by the higher-order nonlinear van der Pol-type equation driven by a term that mimics the light cycle. In this work, noise in the illumination is introduced to investigate its effect on the human circadian cycle. It is found that the presence of noise is detrimental for the sleep/wake rhythm, except for some special values for which it may favor regular oscillations. Depending on system parameters, noise induces regularities, such as stochastic resonance; if the natural light is turned off, it emerges that there is an optimal value of intensity noise which most deteriorates the regularity of the cycle; it is the phenomenon of anti-coherent resonance. Also, the phenomenon of stochastic resonance occurs; in the presence of natural light and there is an optimal noise intensity which improves the evolution of the wake/sleep system. However, there is a critical value of the noise beyond which the system becomes chaotic; indeed, for sufficiently high noise levels (how high depends upon the parameter of the system), the sleep/wake cycle evolves in a random and unpredictable manner, for whatever parameters of the external light.},

  abstract     = {Context : In various domains such as crisis management, medicine, public safety and mobility, there is a necessity to experiment by using state-of-the-art data driven analytics and decision-making approaches, as well as large quantities of complex data. In the same time, data-driven insights need to be extremely timely, accurate, precise, so that they can be useful to the potential user. Objective : This work deals with the problem of experiment design aiming at the best possible experiment outcomes, such as accuracy and sensitivity of the obtained results. Our goal is to define probabilistic model of data analytics workflow that captures dependencies between datasets, methods and deployment options. The general goal is to create a next generation decision support system that integrates novel research results from the domains of data integration, machine learning, explainable knowledge engineering, and model-driven engineering into a common solution. Method : To achieve our objectives, this work implements a Bayesian network and a Markov decision process for modelling the data analytics workflow, that are used at different stages of the experimental process flow definition. Results : To provide a proof of concept, the testing was performed with a minor Bayesian model built for a dataset with precise constraints, set of four mixed ANOVA methods and set of three deployment options. The results illustrate the practical use of the proposed measure for calculating the conditional probabilities, which allows learning a Bayesian network from the experimenter’s usage. Conclusions : The proposed new solution is appropriate and can be used in decision-making throughout the process flow in complex experiments. Due to its practical utility, this solution will be further researched and improved and in later stages integrated into the ExtremeXP framework.},

To meet system load requirements, efficient strategies such as system modeling and design optimization are of great significance, requiring a comprehensive balance between economic and environmental factors. However, the volatility, variability, and uncertainty of renewable energy generation and power supply pose significant challenges to the supply-demand balance of off-grid systems. To address this, this paper proposes a stochastic optimization method aimed at achieving the optimal design of off-grid integrated energy systems. The method incorporates the uncertainties of wind speed and solar irradiance to construct a bi-objective optimization model, which balances the reduction of pollutant emissions and the enhancement of economic benefits while adhering to equipment constraints and ensuring power balance. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative method for evaluating renewable energy penetration rates. Simulation analysis of a real-world project demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the stochastic resonance phenomenon in a time-delayed insect outbreak system driven by cross-correlated Gaussian white noises and multiplicative periodic signals is investigated. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expression of the time-delayed insect outbreak system is acquired in accordance with the small delay approximation theory, the Novikov theorem and the steepest descent method. The results of numerical simulation on the SNR function of the system indicate that the stochastic multiresonance phenomenon appears on the corresponding SNR curve with the increases of the multiplicative noise intensity. However, a conventional stochastic resonance phenomenon is observed on the SNR curve under the influence of additive noise intensity, and resonance and suppression coexist, which indicates that multiplicative noise and additive noise have significantly different impacts on stochastic resonance as the SNR changes with different intensity of noise correlation. When the multiplicative noise intensity takes its value from different ranges, the effect of time delay on SNR differs entirely. When the intensity of noise correlaton is negative and positive, the noise correlation strength has completely opposite influences on the SNR curves.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the transmission characteristics of the virus and focuses on the dynamic properties of a stochastic HIV model with general incidence rate, accounting for virus-to-cell infection, cell-to-cell transmission, and immune impairment. The model incorporates both productively infected cells and latently infected cells, with the contact rates governed by two mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. Under certain assumptions, we first prove that the stochastic system has a unique positive global solution. We further explore the asymptotic behavior of the solution, particularly near the equilibrium points of the corresponding deterministic model. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the existence of stationary distribution is confirmed when 
$${\mathcal {R}}_{0}^{S}>1$$
 R 0 S > 1 . Biologically, stationary distribution indicates that HIV infection can persist for an extended period within the host. Furthermore, it is proved that the virus can be eliminated when 
$${\mathcal {R}}_{0}^{E}<1$$
 R 0 E < 1 . Notably, we calculate the exact expression for the probability density function near the quasi-endemic equilibrium via solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation, which reflects the statistical properties of the stochastic system. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results, and we investigate the effect of stochastic perturbations on the model behavior and give the sensitivity index of each parameter to virus propagation.},

This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm GA based methodology for forecasting energy demand in Morocco’s building sector until 2050. The methodology takes into account historical energy consumption data, socioeconomic factors, and urbanization patterns to represent the complex processes that drive energy demand. The model is evaluated against real International Energy Agency data, indicating a strong correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9634) between projected and observed energy demand. Once validated, the model uses predicted socioeconomic data to assess habitable areas and then anticipates future power usage for buildings. The results show that energy demand increased progressively during the simulation period, with significant results projected for 2030, 2040, and 2050. By 2030, energy demand is predicted to increase by 84.33},

This is especially evident due to work-hardening and thermal softening, leading to problems such as hot-melt adhesion and distortion. To tackle this challenge, a study employed the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) to conduct a systematic analysis of the problem. It identified contradictions and conflicts therein and proposed an innovative optimization strategy based on the Improved Coati Optimization Algorithm (ICOA). Initially, five crucial processing parameters—spindle speed (A_S), cutting tool material (A_CM), feed rate (A_vf), plastic plate material (A_PM), and cutting depth (A_ap)—are determined through grey relational analysis and utilized as input for the prediction model. Subsequently, a processing state prediction model is constructed on the MATLAB software platform, and the ICOA algorithm is used to optimize the model parameters of the convolutional gated recurrent unit network (CNN-GRU), thereby enhancing its robustness, generalization ability, and prediction accuracy. Experimental validation on the PT-1325 CNC machine tool demonstrated that the CNN-GRU model optimized by ICOA attained a prediction accuracy of 96.67},

  abstract     = {Vehicle tracking is a core problem hindering multisensor fusion in intelligent driving. The interference caused by measurement outliers and motion estimation model mismatch seriously affects the estimation accuracy of target states. In view of these problems, an adaptive vehicle target tracking enhancement algorithm based on fuzzy interacting multiple model robust cubature Kalman filtering (FLIMM-IARCKF) is developed. In this algorithm, we constructed a derivative-free adaptive robust cubature Kalman filter (IARCKF) to suppress measurement outliers and errors in motion estimation modeling. Furthermore, a combined fuzzy reasoning method is developed to work with the interacting multiple model algorithm, which further enhances the target tracking performance by increasing the efficiency of model probability updating and by adaptively regulating the process noise covariance matrix. Simulated experiments verify the effectiveness of the IARCKF algorithm and reflect the advantages of the FLIMM-IARCKF algorithm in estimation accuracy, robustness, and model transformation efficiency when compared to the STCKF (Yun et al in Measurement 191:110063, 2022), Huber-CKF (Tseng et al in J Navig 70(3):527–546, 2017), MRCKF (Wu et al Acta Phys Sin 64(21):218401, 2015. https://doi.org/10.7498/aps.64.218401 ) and IMM-CKF (Song et al in ISA Trans 12(6):387–395, 2020) algorithms.

The algorithm was developed according to basic theoretical formulas and provides a certain level of theoretical depth. In addition, to balance the relation between convergence and robustness, an improved restricted method that uses different restricted parameters at different stages was combined with the step-size algorithm. This method maintains the convergence speed while reducing fluctuations. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm eliminates numerous parameters and approaches the optimal step-size without increasing the computational burden. Weight misalignment, stability and complexity performance analyses are also provided. According to the experimental results and analyses, the proposed algorithm has a good performance.},

  abstract     = {It is known that manually detecting heart conditions is often costly and time-consuming and any study regarding diagnose these conditions has a great importance. In this study, a metaheuristic optimization model has been developed to automate the detection of heart diseases with artificial intelligence compatible methods. In the proposed model, the feature set is selected to represent the best heart sound signals and heart disease diagnoses using machine learning algorithms with these feature sets. The proposed method has been tested on the Pascal dataset which consists of four classes. Firstly, an electronic-based filter model is used as low-pass filter and has great potential to use as a filtering for heart sound signals to decrease noise. Secondly, the statistical and acoustic feature vector extracted from the audio signals in the Pascal dataset is passed through particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FA) and cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), and the most suitable feature vector is selected. After obtaining the most suitable feature vector with metaheuristic optimization algorithms and filtering method, heart disease diagnosis is performed using random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms.},

In this study, we explore similar tests on 30-dimensional problems to study the scalability and efficiency of these surrogate models under increased complexity. The surrogate models - k Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost and Support Vector Machines - are used to regress the fitness function, thereby reducing the required number of fitness evaluations to achieve optimization progress. The training of these models is designed to remain cost-effective, requiring frequent recalibration throughout the optimization process. The Wilcoxon test based statistical analysis of experimental results has been made to validate the effectiveness of the surrogate models in both 10 and 30 dimensions. The results indicate that among the considered candidate surrogate models, kNN seems most effective and its incorporation into JADE increases the overall performance of that algorithm.},

This study proposes using surrogate models as an efficient alternative to approximate the fitness value without significantly reducing the overall quality of results.

Traditional detection methods struggle with the identification of various underground anomalies and lack sufficient algorithmic generalization. This study introduces a novel style transfer algorithm, leveraging Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data through generative adversarial networks (GANs), to enhance the detection and generalization capabilities in underground object detection at airports. Our method integrates mask and decoder modules within the network architecture and utilizes adversarial learning to manage variations in underground backgrounds, which are common across different airport environments. This approach effectively minimizes the impact of background disparities on the detection algorithms while maintaining spatial consistency of underground objects. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods, as demonstrated in comparative experiments that involve pre- and post-data enhancement. It not only stabilizes image generation, achieving an average structural similarity index above 0.5, but also improves the average F1 score for multi-object detection by 2},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel integrated multi-algorithm fusion localization and trajectory tracking framework for autonomous vehicles under extreme conditions with non-Gaussian noises. Firstly, in order to solve the problem that GPS signals are interfered with non-Gaussian noises or lost, a localization method based on Particle Filter (PF) is designed, which takes full advantage of the reference objects position information and vehicle driving state information, thus realizing the self-localization for high-speed autonomous vehicles. Besides, considering the accumulated errors of the model-driven Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in the long-horizon positioning prediction, an online future driving state prediction algorithm based on multi-order variable-step Markov model (MM) is proposed to calculate the future vehicle position in scenarios without reference. The fusion of these two methods can give full play to their respective advantages, thus improving the accuracy and robustness of the whole localization algorithm in scenes with non-Gaussian noises. Then, the location information and the future driving state are applied to the trajectory tracking controller based on adaptive model predictive control (AMPC). Finally, the CarSim-Matlab/Simulink cGAOo-simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when GPS signal is interfered with non-Gaussian noises, which further improve the positioning accuracy and autonomous tracking stability.},

In addition, to increase the convergence rates, a multi-direction gradient iterative (DR-MD-GI) based Krylov subspace algorithm is proposed, its basic idea is to construct several orthogonal search directions in each iteration, thereby significantly accelerating the convergence rates and demonstrating significant enhancements in efficiency and reliability. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed DR-MD-GI method has the following advantages: (1) make full use of all the collected data, thus can improve the estimation efficiency; (2) estimate unmeasurable inputs and noise using auxiliary models, thus can enhance the accuracy; (3) adaptively construct several directions in each iteration, thus can increase the convergence rates.

The goal is to maximize the critical buckling load by identifying optimal fiber orientations within the layers using the Bonobo Optimizer Algorithm (BOA). The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is employed to determine elastic buckling loads under combined thermomechanical loading. Numerical investigations are conducted for various parameters, including uniform temperature rises, edge loading conditions, support configurations, hole size ratios, load ratios, and geometric proportions. The results showed that these parameteres play a vital role in the the buckling load optimization of laminate composite plate with a hole. The study shows CCCC and SFSF boundary conditions yield the highest and lowest buckling loads, respectively. Critical buckling load decreases with temperature rise. Plates without cut-outs outperform those with cut-outs, and shorter plates under negative temperature rise achieve maximum buckling load. Uniform loading results in the lowest buckling capacity due to its larger loading area.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in using adaptive filtering algorithms is efficiently emulating a system subject to noisy disturbances. This can be facilitated in applications where the system response to impulse is sparse, which allows for acceleration of the convergence rate if appropriate strategies are used. As a result, methods that impose norm constraints on the estimates are widely used. However, in the case of non-stationary plants to be identified, there is a gap in terms of theoretical performance guarantees of these algorithms. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model capable of predicting the performance of the 
$$\ell _0$$
 ℓ 0 -LMS algorithm in identifying a plant subjected to a first-order Markovian disturbance. Therefore, a tracking analysis is carried out, including both the average performance of the adaptive coefficients and second-order statistics of these coefficients. The theoretical model offers an analytical equation that predicts the asymptotic mean squared deviation in terms of the variance of the Markovian disturbance. Further, for most simulated scenarios, the theoretical model’s error in mean squared deviation remains below 1 dB, even when the learning step varies across several orders of magnitude. It was possible to observe that the theoretical model can accurately predict the steady-state regime for a wide range of learning step values and calculate an optimal value for this parameter. The findings are confirmed through extensive simulations.},

Many of these methods rely on performance critical parameters, which usually need to be set by the designer, potentially leading to suboptimal designs. This contribution presents a two-stage optimization approach to find the optimal configuration for an automotive exhaust gas treatment FDI algorithm. The FDI algorithm is configured and validated using measurement data from a demonstrator car. Challenges are a large design parameter space (16 parameters), a noisy objective function and substantial computational cost when evaluating the FDI function for one configuration. These issues are addressed by using noisy Bayesian Optimization and Tabu Search. The presented approach shows superior validation performance in comparison to particle swarm optimization and random search. It consistently outperforms the default parametrization and gives the designer an insight into which parameters contribute the most.},

  abstract     = {The static parameterization scheme in the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model limits the dynamic capture of latent heat flux (LE) in different plant functional types (PFTs). Therefore, this study employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to optimize the constraint factors and sub-models in the PT-JPL model that are influenced by sensitive prior parameters, thereby constructing five hybrid models under the PT-JPL physical constraint framework to achieve the dynamic response of fixed prior parameters and to integrate ensemble learning (EML) with the process-based framework, ensuring that physical mechanism and high precision coexist. Comparative analysis and validation across five PFTs in the Heihe River Basin of China reveal that the XGB-LEc-PT-JPL model, optimized for vegetation transpiration, exhibits the best comprehensive performance and outperforms the pure data-driven model in several aspects. Regarding overall accuracy, the MAE and RMSE are 15.47 W/m^2 and 23.85 W/m^2, respectively. Although hybrid models optimized for deeper constraint factors sometimes exceed the simulation accuracy of the XGB-LEc-PT-JPL model, they often exhibit reduced parameter generalization, increasing model uncertainty. Finally, the regional scale comparison of different models reveals a consistent spatial pattern, and the XGB-LEc-PT-JPL model can still achieve good simulation accuracy. This study combines EML with physical model, providing scientific insights for understanding hydrological processes under regional climate change, as well as for ecological water resource conservation and optimal water resource allocation.},

This paper is concerned about signal modeling problem for the sine multi-frequency signals or periodic signals. In terms of different characteristics between the signal output and the signal parameters, a separable modeling scheme is presented for estimating the signal parameters. In order to seize the real-time information of the signals to be modeled, a sliding measurement window is designed for using the observations dynamically and implementing accurate parameter estimates. Because the amplitude parameters are linear with respect to the signal output and the angular frequency parameters are nonlinear with respect to the signal output, the signal parameters are separated into a linear parameter set and a nonlinear parameter set. Based on these separable parameter sets, a nonlinear optimization problem is converted into a combination of the optimization quadric and the nonlinear optimization. Then, a separable multi-innovation Newton iterative signal modeling method is derived and implemented to estimate sine multi-frequency signals and periodic signals. The simulation results are found to be effective of modeling dynamic signals. For the reason that the proposed method is based on dynamic sliding measurement window, it can be used for online estimation applications.},

Firstly, a rolling optimization cost function is built based on the observation at a single sampling instant to catch the modal information at a single time point and a generalized extended stochastic gradient (GESG) algorithm is proposed through the stochastic gradient optimization. Secondly, a rolling window cost function is built in accordance with the dynamical batch observations within data window by extending the proposed GESG algorithm and the multi-innovation generalized extended stochastic gradient algorithm is derived. Thirdly, from the perspective of theoretical analysis, the convergence proof of the proposed algorithm is provided based on the stochastic martingale convergence theory.

  abstract     = {Various surrogate-based multiobjective evolutionary algori-thms (MOEAs) have been proposed to solve expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, these algorithms are usually examined on test suites with unrealistically simple Pareto sets (e.g., ZDT and DTLZ test suites). Real-world MOPs usually have complicated Pareto sets, such as a vehicle dynamic design problem and a power plant design optimization problem. Such MOPs are challenging to construct reliable surrogates for surrogate-based MOEAs. Constructed surrogates with low accuracy are likely to make incorrect predictions and even mislead the search direction. In this paper, we propose an improved fuzzy classifier-based MOEA by leveraging the accuracy information of the classifier. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on two well-known test suites with complicated Pareto sets and four real-world problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving realistic MOPs with complicated Pareto sets when only a limited number of function evaluations are available.},

To improve task quality, we aim to automatically design crowdsourcing tasks tailored to requesters’ metrics. Experiments are conducted on Amazon mechanical turk (AMT) to identify the behaviors of online workers, forming a multi-agent system (MAS) as a testbed for evaluating and optimizing task design using an enhanced genetic algorithm. We also show how the MAS can create tasks that meet specified quality metrics. Finally, we validate our task designer through AMT experiments, paving the way for a data-driven approach to task quality assurance in crowdsourcing.},

  abstract     = {In modern digital world, the amount of information is increasing dramatically. All this information requires immediate processing which can be done by automated systems. To accelerate processing in automated systems, new models, methods and efficient algorithms for their implementation are needed. The article considers the problem of distributing incoming messages to handlers in an automated system of an organization. The classical assignment problem and known methods of its solution are the mathematical basis for solving the problem. A generalization of the assignment problem with invalid combinations of assignments is considered as a model. A solution algorithm is developed and a software product for solving the described problem in the Python language is implemented. Moreover, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the quality of the developed algorithm and check its feasibility. The applied problem posed in this paper is relevant as in terms of its practical application and as the study of the mathematical model of the assignment problem and methods of its solution. The developed algorithm allows us to calculate the system load and regulate the number of handlers in operation. The obtained results can serve as input parameters for the simulation model of the incoming message processing system which will allow experimenting with the load of such a system.},

Cyberattacks continuously evolve and adapt to exploit potential vulnerabilities in emerging technologies. The types of cyberattacks have become increasingly complex and diverse, posing significant threats to the security of digital assets and personal information. Therefore, machine learning techniques for analyzing threats represented as graphs have emerged to respond to complex attacks. For this reason, it remains challenging to develop and design datasets with a graph-based structure. The majority of open-source datasets related to cybersecurity come from capturing network traffic, which may not fully encompass comprehensive cyber threat detection. The methodology involves a process of feature extraction from operating system logs. This is essential for facilitating processing in the form of graph-based machine learning. The results will consist of two types of datasets: Edge Dataset collects data in the form of edges, which capture the connectivity relationships between device networks. Node Dataset collects data in the form of nodes, containing features and labels, further subdivided into Windows and Ubuntu operating systems. The dataset will be used for cyber threat detection and made available to other researchers interested in machine learning for further development related to graphs.},

  abstract     = {The German construction industry has experienced strong growth over the last decade. Nevertheless, the planning and control of construction site processes are currently still predominantly manual and based on experience. At the same time, these processes are very similar to traditional production systems, especially in terms of their complexity and the challenges of scheduling and resource planning. In this area, structured and standardized planning as well as control-based key performance indicators (KPIs) are state of the art. For this reason, this paper describes an approach to systematically transfer lean production methods to the building trade. Therefore, application-specific KPIs are methodically developed in cooperation with technical building equipment (TBE) companies by adapting KPIs from traditional production systems and evaluating their practical applicability in daily work. These KPIs are then complemented by newly designed KPIs, developed in workshop sessions with the TBE companies. This results in a total of 14 KPIs, which are mapped to a previously developed project management (PM) methodology based on lean and agile management approaches. The data-based PM methodology and the use of KPIs allow stakeholders to digitally track the status of the construction site, identify possible weak points and utilize optimization potential, which will be validated in future construction site projects.},

As such processes are characterised by a high degree of flexibility, creativity, and complexity, they usually rely on different techniques and technologies compared to traditional “well-structured” processes. Accordingly, the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) was proposed similarly to BPMN for the structured processes. Even though CMMN is certainly necessary in this field, our preliminary analysis revealed some shortcomings. In this article, we address some of these shortcomings related to the presentation and manipulation of data. More precisely, we are dealing with the extension of the element Case File Item and its associated elements, where metadata is poorly defined. With the help of the existing Dublin Core metadata element set, the element Case File Item was extended structurally and visually to achieve an improved understanding of the business process models.},

Organizations are increasingly embarking on complex data-sharing initiatives, often encompassing personal data, raising heightened privacy concerns and regulatory obligations. With transparency obscured by complexity, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to decompose data ecosystems. Leveraging AT, traditionally applied in intra-organizational contexts, this article proposes extending its application to the ecosystem level. By triangulating qualitative data from case studies and expert interviews, key privacy concerns of both business and regulatory stakeholders in data ecosystems are unveiled. Based on these concerns, the study develops and demonstrates a comprehensive data ecosystem architecture meta-model as a foundation for AT to govern privacy from both a business and regulatory perspective. The contributions bridge existing gaps in understanding and addressing privacy concerns within data ecosystems, offering stakeholders a systematic approach for analysis and mitigation.},

In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved significant success in image recognition, which is potentially relevant for interpreting ground-penetrating radar data. This is because the various types of damage develop at different levels and in different quantities. So the number of datasets of various types of road injuries is not balanced. This leads to poor accuracy of deep learning for injury classification. And the cost of collecting a large amount of data in the field is higher. The aim of this paper is to improve classification accuracy at a lower cost relative to field collection, we propose a damage data expansion method based on generative adversarial network, which consists of encoder and a generative adversarial network. We have made a number of improvements to the generator and discriminator, as well as to the newly added encoder. All of these improvements have improved the generation results in terms of metrics. So that the network can stably generate damage samples with a small number of samples to improve the classification network’s accuracy. The effect on accuracy by varying the proportions of different kinds of samples and traditional expansion methods is also explored. The improvement of the classification network accuracy and FlD metrics illustrates the better performance of the proposed method.},

The original aim of the Symposium, established by the United Nations University, was to focus on modelling and analysing complex systems while using knowledge management strategies, technology and systems to address problems of sustainable development in various domain areas. The focus was soon expanded to generally addressing the complementarity of model-based and data-driven approaches and the synergetic efforts that can lead to the successful combination of these two approaches. Hence the new name of the Symposium: “From Data to Models and Back” and the new acronym, which have been used since 2016. In this paper we will start from the origins and history of DataMod and will look into the community formed around the Symposium in order to identify some research areas that have been addressed during its first 10 years of life. In this perspective, we will try to understand to which extent the two components of the DataMod community managed to integrate and which synergies between data-driven and model-based approaches have emerged. We will also have a look at what is happening outside DataMod and we will finally discuss which research and collaboration challenges should be addressed by future editions of DataMod.},

This study proposes a privacy-preserving solution for a smart home environment to overcome these challenges. The proposed architecture supports data collection, management and sharing for users, developers and manufacturers of IoT devices in smart homes. Also, it improves the transparency in user privacy control and ensures compliance with privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Union (EU) and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) for Thailand. We implemented a prototype and tested it with both non-technical and technical users. The result from the questionnaires shows that all participants reported successfully completing all tasks and noted that the proposed prototype, with its graph visualisation and user-friendly design, makes understanding the policy’s scope easy.

  abstract     = {To create heterogeneous, multiscale structures with unprecedented functionalities, recent topology optimization approaches design either fully aperiodic systems or functionally graded structures, which compete in terms of design freedom and efficiency. We propose to inherit the advantages of both through a data-driven framework for multiclass functionally graded structures that mixes several families, i.e., classes, of microstructure topologies to create spatially-varying designs with guaranteed feasibility. The key is a new multiclass shape blending scheme that generates smoothly graded microstructures without requiring compatible classes or connectivity and feasibility constraints. Moreover, it transforms the microscale problem into an efficient, low-dimensional one without confining the design to predefined shapes. Compliance and shape matching examples using common truss geometries and diversity-based freeform topologies demonstrate the versatility of our framework, while studies on the effect of the number and diversity of classes illustrate the effectiveness. The generality of the proposed methods supports future extensions beyond the linear applications presented.},

  abstract     = {Biogas reactors operating with protein-based biomass have a high methane potential and industrial value. Protein-rich materials, including gelatin processing and ossein factory waste, are suitable feedstocks for use in ammonia-tolerant biogas digesters. However, the anaerobic digestion of these materials is limited by the accumulation of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and lactic acid. A stable biogas starter is required for efficient biogas production from protein-based mass and process performance. Hence, various ammonia-tolerant biogas inocula, immobilization carriers used, culture formulations, and stater stability are comprehensively summarized in this review. We also discuss engineered methanogens and mutants to improve methane productivity. The genera Methanoculleus and Methanosarcina are the dominant ammonia-tolerant methanogens studied in different biogas plants; however, their ammonia-tolerant molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent advances in omics technologies, systems, and synthetic biology of methanogens have been reviewed and discussed for the design and development of methanogenic inocula. We described the genome-centric characteristics of methanogenic consortia to improve the process efficiency under the desired environmental conditions. We also focus on the perspective of methanogenic culture development for the co-production of acetone–butanol–ethanol and methane as well as odor control strategies. A novel metabolic scaffold “Protein Catabolism-Directed Methanogenesis” was discovered from a methanogenic culture using a systems biology approach. This review offers new insights into the feasibility of ammonia-tolerant biogas starters and engineering synthetic pathways for recycling gelatin processing waste into biofuels in the energy sector.},

There is a scarcity of large-scale analysis of literature in this field based on quantitative approaches. This study performed a bibliometric and topic modeling examination on 683 articles from 2002 to 2022, focusing on research topics and trends, journals, countries/regions, institutions, authors, and scientific collaborations. Results showed that, firstly, the number of articles has grown from 1 in 2002 to 220 in 2022, with a majority being published in interdisciplinary journals that link healthcare and medical research and information technology and AI. Secondly, the significant rise in the quantity of research articles can be attributed to the increasing contribution of scholars from non-English speaking countries/regions and the noteworthy contributions made by authors in the USA and India. Thirdly, researchers show a high interest in diverse research issues, especially, cross-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor analysis, cancer prognosis through multi-dimensional data analysis, and AI-assisted diagnostics and personalization in healthcare, with each topic experiencing a significant increase in research interest. There is an emerging trend towards issues such as applying generative adversarial networks and contrastive learning for multimodal medical image fusion and synthesis and utilizing the combined spatiotemporal resolution of functional MRI and electroencephalogram in a data-centric manner. This study is valuable in enhancing researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of the present focal points and upcoming trajectories in AI-powered smart healthcare based on multimodal data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Obviously, the complexity of mathematical database cost models increases with the evolution of the database technology brought by emerging hardware and the new deployment platforms (ex. Cloud). This finding raises questions about the reliability of past Cost Models (CMs). Indeed, redesigning a database CM to evaluate the quality of service (QoS) attributes (i.e. response time, energy, sizing, etc.) is becoming a challenging task. First, because developers directly implement the CM by hard coding inside a DBMS without a prior design. Second, due to a lack of a stepwise development process to support an incremental CM design and continuous testing to diagnose errors that occur at each design stage. Moreover, reusing CMs for other purposes is a major issue that necessitates investigations to allow designers reusing and adapting CMs according to their needs. To take up these challenges, we propose a model-based framework for incremental design and continuous testing of Database CMs Specifically, we are motivated by proposing an approach that aims at shifting CMs design from an adhoc design to a structured and shared design by using a set of design guidelines inspired from software engineering practices. Finally, we propose to use the DevOps reuse practices (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery: CI/CD) to store the CM under design in a repository after each upgrade to be reused, improved, calibrated, and refined for other purposes. We evaluate our approach against common CM features, and we carry out a comparison with some analytical models from the literature. Findings show that our framework provides a high CM prediction accuracy, and identify the right design components with a precision ranging from 85},

  abstract     = {For the thickness measurement of refractory structures, the impact-echo measurement is one of the methods being used. This method is especially suited for the cases where high frequencies cannot be used due to the high damping and scattering in the materials. The data gathered with this method are often processed using a one-dimensional approach, which works well for simple layered structures. However, when the geometry is more complex, the thickness of the material needs to be estimated, as well as the shape of the interface. In this paper a method for inversion of impact-echo data in a two-dimensional setting is presented using multiple transducers. The algorithm was implemented using Fenics finite element software. The software is used to solve the elastic wave equation and the dolfin-adjoint toolbox is used for efficient computation of the shape gradient. In the paper, the algorithm is tested on two common erosion profiles. These examples show that, under reasonable initial assumptions, the solution converges close to the shape of the true interface. In practice, it is convenient to use a low number of sensors; for the two cases, a numerical experiment is carried out to determine the minimum number of sources required to arrive at a good result. The robustness of the algorithm is tested by adding roughness to the interface and by superimposing noise on the reference signals. The last experiment investigates how the solutions change as the number of samples increases.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach based on specifying the tests declaratively, and using an automatic generation of business-rule-compliant initial test states from this specification. In our approach, users declaratively specify the required system state, together with the domain business rules it must satisfy, and we delegate to an automated reasoner the creation of the valid initial state. We also show how the approach can be effectively implemented in Java, and we share experimental results showcasing its feasibility in a realistic project.},

In particular, systems supporting the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) principles of scientific data management. Results We propose a Service Oriented Architecture approach for integrated management and analysis of multi-omics and biomedical imaging data. Our architecture introduces an image management system into a FAIR-supporting, web-based platform for omics data management. Interoperable metadata models and middleware components implement the required data management operations. The resulting architecture allows for FAIR management of omics and imaging data, facilitating metadata queries from software applications. The applicability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated using two technical proofs of concept and a use case, aimed at molecular plant biology and clinical liver cancer research, which integrate various imaging and omics modalities. Conclusions We describe a data management architecture for integrated, FAIR-supporting management of omics and biomedical imaging data, and exemplify its applicability for basic biology research and clinical studies. We anticipate that FAIR data management systems for multi-modal data repositories will play a pivotal role in data-driven research, including studies which leverage advanced machine learning methods, as the joint analysis of omics and imaging data, in conjunction with phenotypic metadata, becomes not only desirable but necessary to derive novel insights into biological processes.},

These key performance indicators are commonly predicted using detailed simulation models; however, the detailed simulation models are computationally expensive and have high development and maintenance costs. In this paper, we propose an aggregate modeling approach, where each work area, i.e., a group of functionally similar workstations, in the wafer fab is aggregated into a single-server queueing system. The parameters of the queueing system can be derived directly from arrival and departure data of that work area. To obtain fab-level predictions, our proposed methodology builds a network of aggregate models, where the network represents the entire fab consisting of different work areas. The viability of this method in practice is demonstrated by applying it to a real-world wafer fab. Experiments show that the proposed model can make accurate predictions, but also provide insights into the limitations of aggregate modeling.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven modeling approach constitutes an appealing alternative to the finite element method for optimizing complex multiphysics parametrized problems. In this context, this paper aims at proposing a parametric solution for the temperature-time evolution during the multiphysics induction heating process by using a data-driven non-intrusive modeling approach. To achieve this goal, firstly, a set of synthetic solutions was collected, at some sparse sensors in the space domain and for properly selected process parameters, by solving the full-order finite element models using FORGE® software. Then, the gappy proper orthogonal decomposition method was used to complete the missing data. Next, the proper orthogonal decomposition method coupled with the nonlinear sparse proper generalized decomposition regression method was applied to find a low-dimensional space onto which the original solutions were projected and a model for the low-dimensional representations was, therefore, created. Hence, a real-time prediction of the temperature-time evolution and for any new process parameters could be efficiently computed at the predefined positions (sensors) in the space domain. Finally, spatial interpolation was carried out to extend the solutions everywhere in the spatial domain by applying a strategy based on the nonlinear dimensionality reduction by locally linear embedding method and the proper orthogonal decomposition method with radial basis functions interpolation. It was shown that the results are promising and the applied approaches provide good approximations in the low-data limit case.},

FIR filters with conventional multipliers and adders are used through which the power consumption is increased. Data-driven clock gating (DDCG) is a technology that uses multibit flip-flops (MBFFs) to share a single clock enabling signal, optimize clock latency, manage clock skew, and improve routing source utilization.

Many contributions were proposed defining pipelines dedicated to Big Data processing and storage, but they target usually particular types of data and specific technologies to meet precise needs without considering the evolution of requirements or the data characteristics’ change. Thus, no approach has defined a generic architecture for Big Data warehousing process. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer model that integrates all the necessary elements and concepts in the different phases of a data warehousing process. It also contributes to generate an architecture that considers the specificity of data and applications and the suitable technologies. To illustrate our contribution, we have implemented the proposed model through a Business model and a Big Data architecture for the analysis of multi-source and social networks data.},

In this paper, we propose a dataset of vehicle trajectories that captures the vehicle’s individual characteristics based on multi-sensor fusion, which combines the data of UAV and radar vehicle detector, and applies Kalman filter for accuracy correction. Drones provide a bird’s-eye view of a wide range of road areas and capture the vehicle’s global trajectory, while radar detectors are mounted on pedestrian overpasses to provide precise data on vehicle personalization and speed. By taking advantage of the advantages of both sensors, the limitations of a single sensor in complex environments are effectively overcome. In addition, radar is able to capture personalized information such as vehicle type, size, license plate number, license plate color, and vehicle brand and sub-brand logos. The experimental results show that the multi-sensor fusion method based on Kalman filter achieves higher detection accuracy and robustness in various environments, and significantly improves the effect of vehicle data acquisition. This dataset provides key data support for analyzing driving behavior patterns, developing interaction strategies for autonomous vehicles, and advancing research into autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).},

However, while the problem of gender bias in education has been widely addressed from a student perspective, it is still not fully analysed from an academic point of view. In this work, we study the problem of gender bias in academic promotions (i.e., from Researcher to Associated Professor and from Associated to Full Professor) in the informatics (INF) and software engineering (SE) Italian communities (we restricted to the Italian community since each country has specific and own promotion systems). In particular, we first conduct a literature review to assess how the problem of gender bias in academia has been addressed so far. Next, we describe a process to collect and preprocess the INF and SE data needed to analyse gender bias in Italian academic promotions. Subsequently, we apply a formal bias metric to these data to assess the amount of bias and look at its variation over time. From the conducted analysis, we observe how the SE community presents a higher bias in promotions to Associate Professors and a smaller bias in promotions to Full Professors compared to the overall INF community.},

  abstract     = {With the abundance of event data, the challenge of enabling process discovery in the large has attracted the community attention. Several works addressed the problem by performing process discovery directly on relational databases, instead of the traditional file based computations. Preliminary results show that moving (parts of) process discovery to the database engine outperforms file based computations. However, all existing works consider the traditional storage of event data which assumes that a clear and predefined process instance notion exists, and that events are correlated to one process instance. In this work, we go two steps further. First, we address the problem of process discovery on object-centric event data which allows several process instance notions to be flexibly defined. We refer to it as multi-process discovery Second, motivated by the intrinsic nature of process discovery that searches for relationships in event data, we address the question of how graph-based storage of object-centric event data improves the performance of multi-process discovery? We propose in-database process discovery operators based on labeled property graphs. We use Neo4j as a DBMS and Cypher as a query language. We compare different discovery strategies that involve graph and relational databases. Our results show that process discovery in graph databases outperform existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, companies rely on data-driven strategies more than ever to improve their business and develop a sustainable competitive advantage. However, building a successful data-driven approach requires all data ecosystem components, including metadata management, as a crucial element of any data processing. Managing Metadata is highly needed for data analytics since it provides valuable insights on data and enables time and cost-effective data management. Managing Metadata has received more attention since big data tools use Metadata for data storage and processing with the emergence of big data. Moreover, other metadata use purposes have appeared, such as data identification and discovery, data quality assessment, content tracking and monitoring, etc. Nevertheless, metadata management could not be effective without considering the quality aspect of metadata. Indeed, in big data environments, the gathered Metadata are unstructured, heterogeneous, and may contain inconsistent values. Such Metadata could not support traditional data management and may negatively affects data processing. Despite the high dependency between metadata management and metadata quality, these two notions are generally addressed separately. Thus, this work highlights how metadata quality could be improved throughout the different phases of Metadata in a big data environment. Moreover, we present in this paper how successful metadata governance could be achieved. Finally, we conclude with some possible future work directions.},

Establishing a minimum level of common information sharing and trust among decision-making stakeholders, often termed as decisional interoperability, is needed for industry adoption. Purely data-driven approaches risk ignoring the enterprise environment and situational context of decisions and are insufficient for such interoperability to the extent that the decision-making rationale is opaque. While linked data and knowledge approaches have long been pursued in the context of data-driven machine learning, these have not been particularly well explored in the context of decisional enterprise interoperability. This paper aims to narrow this gap. It explores how the introduction of AI is changing decisional interoperability concerns. It then outlines patterns of human-AI teaming in decision-making, as well as methods, such as knowledge-infused AI and mechanisms, such as active learning, for enhancing decisional interoperability. Three diverse application domain-cases offer context for an analysis of AI decision-making considerations and decisional interoperability. The paper concludes with arguments about how integration of knowledge into data-driven AI contributes to decisional interoperability and further work needed in this area.},

  abstract     = {Hydrological process modelling consistency is associated with long available gauged data and reliable parameters, which is often limited. Multi-sensors and satellite-based products are considered as an alternative, especially dealing with ungauged basins. In this study, a HEC-HMS hydrological model is used to test two rainfall dataset reliability (Gauges, TRMM product). The testing period is fixed for 2000–2011 to simulate streamflow generated at upper Oum Er Rbia basin. Dealing with soil information lack in the study, we implemented SCS-CN approach in its spatially semi distributed manner, adjusting CN, and comparing streamflow obtained by interpolated gauged and average TRMM pixels values, the model was calibrated to determine its accurate CN for the study area. In the calibration phase, the analysis of CN sensitivity shows its importance on direct flow simulation and for HEC-HMS results. Moreover, the optimal value for the study area is ranging between 30 and 40. In addition, the elaborated model is showing slightly sufficient performance when using TRMM precipitation data at a daily time scale even though its overestimations during intense precipitation events. As a conclusion, the model validation results show an instability estimation for simulated daily streamflow at the upper Oum Er Rbia basin.},

In pursuit of fulfilling the unachieved promise of the Semantic Web to facilitate machine functionality, we have focused on one particular aspect: ensuring a comprehensive experience in any consuming application. To this end, we have investigated how the appropriate reuse and exploitation of metadata can realize this vision. We have thus defined a metadata model combining an interpretation of existing metadata vocabularies with a new lightweight ontology concerned with dataset accessibility. Then, we have developed a metadata registry and a set of associated services that complement the proposed model in satisfying our elicited requirements. As tangible evidence of our solution's effectiveness and influence, we describe and examine the implementation of the metadata registry in three distinct, open-source applications.},

There has been considerable progress in delivering corporate guidelines, technical specifications, and software components available for testing and deploying applications to support IDS-based ecosystems, such as the IDS data connectors classified by the Fraunhofer Institute. However, full implementation of IDS applications seems still complex and expensive for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A possible strategy to deal with such an issue is to break the IDSA specification’s complexity into smaller pieces and build small IDS ecosystems formed by its core business roles (e.g., data owners, users, and broker service providers). In this context, this paper addresses the problem of designing an application to support the broker service provider’s role in operating in an IDS-based ecosystem. This research, therefore, follows a Design Science approach in a three-step process. First, it investigates problems of practical relevance elicited from the IDSA guidelines in combination with requirements provided by representatives of the Dutch Logistics sector. Second, it gives design to tackle the problem by combining Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Enterprise Architecture modeling artifacts. Last, it validates the architecture of the broker service provider’s application by demonstrating its technical feasibility, innovation, and software integration.},

When evaluating approaches, there is a wide range of possible types of studies that can be used, each with different properties. Benchmarks have the benefit that they establish clearly defined standards and baselines. However, when creating new benchmarks, researchers face various problems regarding the identification of potential data, its mining, as well as the creation of baselines. As a result, some research domains do not have any benchmarks at all. This is the case for traceability link recovery between software architecture documentation and software architecture models. In this paper, we create and describe an open-source benchmark dataset for this research domain. With this benchmark, we define a baseline with a simple approach based on information retrieval techniques. This way, we provide other researchers a way to evaluate and compare their approaches.},

Comparing 7 diverse sources across 145 countries, we find significant differences in mobility patterns and networks, impacting applications like epidemic modeling and emphasizing the need for transparent data processing. The description of human mobility is at the core of many fundamental applications ranging from urbanism and transportation to epidemics containment. Data about human movements, once scarce, is now widely available thanks to new sources such as phone call detail records, GPS devices, or Smartphone apps. Nevertheless, it is still common to rely on a single dataset by implicitly assuming that the statistical properties observed are robust regardless of data gathering and processing techniques. Here, we test this assumption on a broad scale by comparing human mobility datasets obtained from 7 different data-sources, tracing 500+ millions individuals in 145 countries. We report wide quantifiable differences in the resulting mobility networks and in the displacement distribution. These variations impact processes taking place on these networks like epidemic spreading. Our results point to the need for disclosing the data processing and, overall, to follow good practices to ensure robust and reproducible results.},

Therefore, we introduce xMarkerFinder, a four-stage computational framework for microbial biomarker identification with comprehensive validations from cross-cohort datasets, including differential signature identification, model construction, model validation and biomarker interpretation. xMarkerFinder enables the identification and validation of reproducible biomarkers for cross-cohort studies, along with the establishment of classification models and potential microbiome-induced mechanisms. Originally developed for gut microbiome research, xMarkerFinder’s adaptable design makes it applicable to various microbial habitats and data types. Distinct from existing biomarker research tools that typically concentrate on a singular aspect, xMarkerFinder uniquely incorporates a sophisticated feature selection process, specifically designed to address the heterogeneity between different cohorts, extensive internal and external validations, and detailed specificity assessments. Execution time varies depending on the sample size, selected algorithm and computational resource. Accessible via GitHub ( https://github.com/tjcadd2020/xMarkerFinder ), xMarkerFinder supports users with diverse expertise levels through different execution options, including step-to-step scripts with detailed tutorials and frequently asked questions, a single-command execution script, a ready-to-use Docker image and a user-friendly web server ( https://www.biosino.org/xmarkerfinder ). The authors describe xMarkerFinder, a four-stage computational framework for microbial biomarker identification with comprehensive validations from cross-cohort datasets. xMarkerFinder is the first computational framework aggregating meta-analyses and machine learning models for the establishment and validation of universally robust microbial biomarkers across multiple cohorts. This protocol is for using xMarkerFinder, a four-stage computational framework, to enable the identification and validation of reproducible microbial biomarkers from cross-cohort studies, and establish potential microbiome-induced mechanisms.},

The developed model is proposed for model predictive driving option in e-bikes to provide optimal motor torque operation against predicted road disturbances. The driving profile is designed to simulate urban driving in different road types by considering pedal usage frequency and pedal load measurement in combined drive. Firstly, a datalogger is designed, and the microcontroller is programmed to measure pedal force independently in all road profiles. Road profiles are divided into two groups, pedal-assisted routes and the full electric driving mode, and all range capacities are recorded to make allover comparisons. Road types consist of asphalt and graded gravel at different slope levels. Pedal load statistical relationship based on each route is also indicated, and the road-based difference is also presented. The obtained data are used for data-driven model development in the MPC control model as measured disturbances. The control model then is integrated into the one-dimensional model to provide road estimation. The design of the developed model provides sensorless road disturbance estimation in urban driving. The proposed control model presents an innovative approach for system designing of micro-e-mobility vehicles in optimum longitudinal vehicle control considering the data-driven MPC method.},

However, the creation of Work Packages often faces challenges, especially in terms of data integration involving multiple departments.

The research methodology includes problem identification through interviews, modeling the current business processes (as-is), qualitative analysis using Process Activity Mapping (PAM) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and quantitative analysis using simulations. The business processes are then redesigned (to-be) using a heuristic approach, and simulations are conducted to monitor and measure their impact compared to the current business processes (as-is).

Runtime errors for entry existence and data types are typically caught later in the development process of higher-level application-specific APIs. In this paper, we propose exploiting modern C ++ metaprogramming features to add compile-time type-safety to improve the interaction with a well-defined metadata-rich scientific schema in domain-specific hierarchical datasets. We tackle two aspects of common use: (i) direct data access, (ii) flexible “in-memory” index models for efficient search and data processing. The proposed APIs use C ++ 17’s template type auto deduction features, C ++ 11’s enum class for type-safety and C-style preprocessor macros for generative templated code. We showcase the pros and cons of our initial work on the standard NeXus schema used for annotating and storing experimental neutron scattering data at several facilities around the world on top of HDF5. Extendable compile-time type-safe APIs are a desirable feature that could be indexed by any modern integrated development environment (IDE). Hence, such APIs can help ease the learning curve for domain scientists using a less error-prone software interaction to enhance the findability of their data without resorting to a domain-specific language (DSL).},

  abstract     = {Recently, the consideration of data aspects has seen a surge in interest both from the perspective of designing processes as from a model discovery perspective. However, it seems that both research domains (models for design and model discovery) use different conceptualisations of data/object-aware systems. In an ideal situation, when (designed) models are implemented, the resulting information systems are equipped with logging functionalities that allow the rediscovery of the models based on which the information systems were implemented. However, there is a lack of guidelines on how to set up logging. From a logging perspective, logging formats are unclear about the granularity of events: the logging may be done at the level of entire tasks or at the level of the operations on individual objects, or a single log may even contain a mix of events at different granularity levels. The lack of clarity in this matter complicates the correct interpretation of log information. The goal of this paper is therefore to investigate how the concepts of object-centric logging and those for data-aware process modelling may be better aligned. This will facilitate setting up proper logging at system implementation time, and facilitate the connection of discovered models to models-for-design. The investigation resulted in iDOCEM, a meta-model that aligns the DOCEL and the Merode meta-model. Comparing iDOCEM to different other logging meta-models demonstrates that the proposed meta-model is complete enough to capture (more than) existing logging formats.},

These challenges require the integration of diverse storage and computing platforms. Consequently, incorporating new data sources and developing new data transformation methods is typically a slow and expensive process. Furthermore, these platforms often lack sufficient abstraction and are heavily reliant on particular technologies, which results in increased costs when adapting to new technological developments. This paper addresses these issues by presenting the Data Platform Shaper , an open tool for constructing and managing data platform catalogs as knowledge graphs. This system is built on top of the Agile Data Management Ontology (AGILE-DM) , a novel ontology specifically designed for describing big data platforms.

Over the course of 18 months, the group authored a new specification and validated it through the development and testing of multiple independent implementations. The outcome of this work is a standard, implementation-agnostic method for defining views that produce tabular data from FHIR resources. SQL on FHIR view definitions can be written to cover common use cases and can be executed across a variety of technology platforms. We evaluate the feasibility of this approach by replicating findings from an existing study across multiple view runner and database implementations, demonstrating portability and consistency.},

  abstract     = {Agent-based modeling, or agent-based model (ABM), is a powerful tool that helps researchers understand complex and high-stakes problems, such as the impact of climate change, digital twins, or epidemiology issues. However, as the scale and/or the precision of these models increase, performance problems emerge when running large simulations on standard computers. Agent-based simulation platforms, can no longer run these large-scale models in a reasonable amount of time, or even cannot run them at all. To address these problems, ABM can be distributed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques to divide the workload across multiple processors, speeding up the simulation execution. Distribution bring the need for defining data synchronization protocols between processors, and ways to access agents across processors to properly execute the distributed simulation. To tackle the issues introduced by the distribution of a model, we propose the concept of proxy : entities managing interactions between agents across distributed instances of a simulation and controlling access to agent data using data synchronization policies . The effectiveness is shown through a case study using the GAMA platform.},

  abstract     = {Our long-term project involves performing general-purpose computation on 2D amorphous computing media, which consist of arbitrary many, small, identical processing elements that are homogeneously spread in 2D Euclidian space, and that communicate locally in space. While the minimal assumptions on hardware provide the fascinating perspective of arbitrary large computing power, they also make programming notoriously difficult. Furthermore, our project involves simulating objects extended in 2D-space, called “blobs”. Maintaining the connectedness of blobs while they move in space adds another layer of difficulty since it demands to process the topology of 2D space. This paper describes a new parallel data structure that can simplify the programming task, in this context. In computer graphics, processing related to 2D topology is performed by using triangle meshes. We consider synchronous media whose underlying network is also a triangle mesh. Our data structure, derived from computer graphics, is anchored on that mesh so that its operations can be compiled on the medium. More precisely, our compiler produces a circuit of logic gates, which enables a high-performance simulation, in the case of crystalline media (Cellular Automata). We demonstrate the expressiveness of the data structure’s operation by using an incremental and modular programming style. We program, first small, then larger building-block functions, and re-use them. Blobs are implemented and re-used to compute the Voronoï diagram. What is the scope of the data-structure? This poses the question of whether there exists a universal set of primitives able to program any processing specified only in terms of 2D-geometry.},

  abstract     = {Malaria remains an endemic disease in many developing countries around the world. For several decades, various malaria control strategies have been developed and implemented in many countries. Many fields like medicine, biology, physics, mathematics, and computer sciences are used to set up these strategies. Mathematical models have proven to be very useful in understanding malaria progression and dynamics. Mainly, these models are based on differential equations and take into account the clinical and biological characteristics of patients and vectors. They made it possible to study the parts of the population which pass from a state of exposure to the disease to different possible states as a result. These mathematical models in general consider global estimates of the evolution of the epidemic based on unspecified percentages of the population. Individuals are considered fairly evenly. However, the health status of each individual as well as their own daily activities can have a particular influence on the epidemic evolution. The objective of this paper is to propose a model based on a daily evolution of the individual’s condition, which depends on their mobility and the characteristics of the territory they visit. Thus, mobility data of a single person moving from one area to another is used to calculate disease progression and predict outcomes. We implement our solution and demonstrate its effectiveness through empirical experiments. The results show how promising the model is in providing possible information on the failure of disease control in the Kédougou region.},

  abstract     = {The use of instrumentation in monitoring or evaluating geodynamic phenomena such as landslide, ground subsidence, earthquake, as well as engineering structures such as dams, foundations, deep excavations, landfills, tunnels and underground openings is widespread. The data of common instruments including piezometers, load/pressure cells, settlement-meters, extensometers, inclinometers, tiltmeters, etc. accumulates over time and forms a huge volume which, without having a proper database and application, causes many problems for users. Therefore, it is essential to create a database/application to store and analyze such periodic datasets in an integrated environment. ArcGIS as a good geospatial platform was used to store, retrieve, analyze, and visualize the instrumentation data. Being one of the most complex types of projects in terms of spatial arrangement of instruments, the embankment dam was chosen, the data of which was used to develop a geodatabase/application. For the purposes of this paper, a relational geodatabase is designed based on data from instruments installed in a dam in NW Iran. Then, a new Dam Data Analysis Application (DDAA) Toolbox was developed using ArcGIS ModelBuilder. DDAA provides valuable custom maps/charts in cross and longitudinal sections of the dam for parameters of pore-pressure, pore-pressure ratio, total stress, arching ratio, and displacement. Also, the toolbox was carefully evaluated and a complete correlation of observations with model-driven results was obtained. It is emphasized that the main purpose of this paper is to develop a geodatabase/application to manage instrumentation data rather than to analyze the behavior of a specific structure.

  abstract     = {Biological imaging is one of the primary tools by which we understand living systems across scales from atoms to organisms. Rapid advances in imaging technology have increased both the spatial and temporal resolutions at which we examine those systems, as well as enabling visualisation of larger tissue volumes. These advances have huge potential but also generate ever increasing amounts of imaging data that must be stored and analysed. Public image repositories provide a critical scientific service through open data provision, supporting reproducibility of scientific results, access to reference imaging datasets and reuse of data for new scientific discovery and acceleration of image analysis methods development. The scale and scope of imaging data provides both challenges and opportunities for open sharing of image data. In this article, we provide a perspective influenced by decades of provision of open data resources for biological information, suggesting areas to focus on and a path towards global interoperability.},

In cases where real-world data for industrial processes is insufficient, a simulation tool is employed to generate an extensive dataset of process variables under varying operating conditions. Subsequently, this dataset is utilized for training the Machine Learning model. The paper showcases a practical use case of this hybrid modelling approach, revealing a model that consistently demonstrates strong predictive accuracy and reliability within the specific industrial context we investigate. By merging the insights derived from physics-based understanding with the adaptability of data-driven Machine Learning, the hybrid model offers a comprehensive solution for precise and accurate predictions.},

Thus, organizations should maintain and assess their big data to improve their capabilities. However, there is still no structured approach with consistent and detailed guidelines that adopt policies and standards to assess and audit big data capabilities in a structured way. In this paper, we aim to provide a generic approach to collecting, managing, and analyzing the organization’s big data capabilities. First, we propose an integrated maturity assessment model that aligns the controls, policies, and best practices to comply with the most recent standard (COBIT 5) throughout the entire big data lifecycle. It can help assess the organization’s big data. We adjusted COBIT 5 practices, and controls to support big data capabilities. These controls were reviewed by professional auditors. Then, we used our proposed integrated maturity assessment model to establish our auditing approach to support the big data auditing process in an efficient way. Finally, we applied our approach to COVID-19 data to support the process of assessing and auditing patients’ data. As proof of concept, we provide an assessment and auditing tool called BMA, and we evaluate it by an auditing expert and apply his recommendations for improvement.},

  abstract     = {Simulations are key steps in the design, implementation, and verification of autonomous vehicles (AV). Parallel to this, typical simulation tools fail to integrate the entirety of the aspects related to the complexity of AV applications, such as data communication delay, security, and the integration of software/hardware-in-the-loop and other simulation tools. This work proposes a SmartData-based middleware to integrate AV simulators and external tools. The interface models the data used on a simulator and creates an intermediary layer between the simulator and the external tools by defining the inputs and outputs as SmartData. A message bus is used for communication between SmartData following their Interest relations. Messages are exchanged following a specific protocol. Nevertheless, the architecture presented is agnostic of protocol. Moreover, we present a data-centric AV design integrated into the middleware. The design considers the standardization of the data interfaces between AV components, including sensing, perception, planning, decision, and actuation. Therefore, the presented design promotes a transparent integration of the AV simulation with other simulators (e.g., network simulators), cloud services, fault injection mechanisms, digital twins, and hardware-in-the-loop scenarios. Moreover, the design allows for transparent, runtime component replacement and time synchronization, the modularization of the vehicle components, and the addition of security aspects in the simulation. We present a case-study application with an AV simulation using CARLA, and we measure the end-to-end delay and overhead incurred in the simulation by our middleware. An increase in the end-to-end delay was measured once data communication was not acknowledged in the original scenario, and data was assumed to be ready for processing with no communication delay between sensors, decision-making, and actuation units.},

This paper formulates a novel state-space decomposition strategy for decoupling control input and measurement attacks in the context of LFC systems with high renewable penetration; introduces a sliding mode observer (SMO) tailored for real-time attack estimation; and integrates an attack-resilient control (ARC) scheme based on

Aiming at the application requirements of virtual simulation monitoring of typical CNC machine tools for the unified interaction and integration of processing and production process data, this paper proposes a development architecture of virtual simulation monitoring and processing process optimization system for CNC machine tools that integrate data, model, communication, and optimization. The data semantic format and data communication are normalized by designing the OPC UA information model of CNC machine tools, modular construction of a three-dimensional digital model, and interactive mapping technology of OPC UA server address space. Virtual simulation visualization and monitoring of CNC machine tools are realized by integrating synchronous simulation modeling, collision detection, and viewpoint control technologies. Building upon this foundation, the control process of the CNC machine tool machining cell is optimized using ECRS and lean production methods. The application focuses on a typical flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) in a machine tool processing and manufacturing workshop. The development of the virtual simulation visualization monitoring system for FMC addresses challenges such as heterogeneous data interaction, sharing, and integration difficulties across multiple heterogeneous equipment. The system successfully fulfills all required functions, and the optimization of the CNC machine tool machining unit’s control process has enhanced equipment utilization and productivity. This solution effectively supports the realization of intelligent manufacturing services, including standardized data-driven digital twins.},

  abstract     = {Multiplets in single-cell sequencing can obscure true biological findings. Here, authors present COMPOSITE, a model-based multiplet detection framework, which helps prevent multiplet clusters, especially in single-cell multiomics data. Droplet-based single-cell sequencing techniques rely on the fundamental assumption that each droplet encapsulates a single cell, enabling individual cell omics profiling. However, the inevitable issue of multiplets, where two or more cells are encapsulated within a single droplet, can lead to spurious cell type annotations and obscure true biological findings. The issue of multiplets is exacerbated in single-cell multiomics settings, where integrating cross-modality information for clustering can inadvertently promote the aggregation of multiplet clusters and increase the risk of erroneous cell type annotations. Here, we propose a compound Poisson model-based framework for multiplet detection in single-cell multiomics data. Leveraging experimental cell hashing results as the ground truth for multiplet status, we conducted trimodal DOGMA-seq experiments and generated 17 benchmarking datasets from two tissues, involving a total of 280,123 droplets. We demonstrated that the proposed method is an essential tool for integrating cross-modality multiplet signals, effectively eliminating multiplet clusters in single-cell multiomics data—a task at which the benchmarked single-omics methods proved inadequate.},

Solving these problems requires a revision of the entire management system of digital company: from business services and business processes to the IT-architecture of a company. An approach has been developed for evaluating the digital company management effectiveness system based on the analysis of KPIs with using of an intelligent data analysis platform, which makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of the digital company management system according to the following parameters: to evaluate of KPI values that determine the digital company effectiveness; to evaluate of the intelligent data analysis platform implementation effectiveness. A method of integral assessment of the results of the implementation of an intelligent data analysis platform is proposed, taking into account: the effect and economic efficiency of the implementation; assessment of the quality of data processing results; technological assessment. The proposed approach to evaluating the management system of a digital company makes it possible to assess the feasibility of the goals set for the development of a digital company and to form goals for the further strategic development of the company.},

  abstract     = {Time series of Kuroshio transport across a section off Shikoku, Japan are derived. Fluctuations of the whole eastward transport are primarily caused by an offshore local stationary anticyclonic eddy. In contrast, throughflow transport, excluding the eddy’s contribution, reflects variations of western-boundary transport expected to compensate for interior Sverdrup transport (WBST). The mean throughflow transport is considerably smaller than the mean WBST. Throughflow transport exhibits a long-term decreasing trend, consistent with WBST. On an interannual scale, throughflow transport lags behind WBST by approximately 5 years. Mean throughflow transports during large meander periods and non-largemeander periods are almost the same.},

It uses a sliding window technique for continuous learning in data streams, coupled with updating learning models upon the completion of each window to maintain accurate detection and align with current data trends. It proposes ASTD patterns for combining learning models, especially in the context of unsupervised learning, which is commonly used for data streams. To facilitate this, a new ASTD operator is proposed, the Quantified Flow, which enables the seamless combination of learning models while ensuring that the specification remains concise. Our contribution is a specification pattern, highlighting the capacity of ASTDs to abstract and modularize anomaly detection systems. The ASTD language provides a unique approach to develop data flow anomaly detection systems, grounded in the combination of processes through the graphical representation of the language operators. This simplifies the design task for developers, who can focus primarily on defining the functional operations that constitute the system.},

These products have been widely used in weather forecasting and hydrological and climate studies. However, the accuracy of satellite products varies spatially and across different datasets. In this study, the accuracy of five satellite-based precipitation products with different spatial resolutions, i.e., CHIRPS, ERA5, TRMM, GPM, and TerraClim available on Google Earth Engine (GEE) were compared with India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data in six climate zones in India. The statistics such as RMSE , R ^2, MSE , and PBIAS were computed. It was observed that the performance of each product varies in different climatic zones. The GPM was observed to have high accuracy in arid, semi-arid, and tropical wet zones. TRMM showed a good match in tropical wet and dry, tropical wet, and semi-arid zones. TerraClim and ERA5 showed high accuracy in humid subtropical and montane regions, respectively. It was also observed that CHRIPS was found to be least suitable in all the climate zones across India. The findings from the present studies will serve as a guiding document for the researcher to select appropriate datasets for different applications such as drought monitoring, precipitation anomaly, hydrological models, or other related studies in India.},

These networks delineate the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes, thereby uncovering the regulatory processes that modulate gene expression under varying environmental conditions. Analyzing TRNs offers valuable insights into bacterial adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic optimization from an evolutionary standpoint. Additionally, understanding TRNs can drive the development of novel antimicrobial therapies and the engineering of microbial strains for biofuel and bioproduct production. This protocol integrates advanced data analysis pipelines, including ChEAP, DEOCSU, and DESeq2, to analyze omics datasets that encompass genome-wide TF binding sites and transcriptome profiles derived from ChIP-exo and RNA-seq experiments. This approach minimizes both the time required and the risk of bias, making it accessible to non-expert users. Key steps in the protocol include preprocessing and peak calling from ChIP-exo data, differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data, and motif and regulon analysis. This method offers a comprehensive and efficient framework for TRN reconstruction across various bacterial strains, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of the analysis while providing valuable insights for basic and applied research.},

Conversely, the sentiment index derived from financial news data, utilizing a time-varying dictionary, demonstrates improved out-of-sample predictive accuracy for the Ibovespa.

It delves into a wide range of research areas including person ReID, human parsing, human pose estimation, and pedestrian detection, addressing the significant challenges posed by overfitting and limited training data in these domains. Our work categorizes data augmentation methods into two main types: data generation and data perturbation. Data generation covers techniques like graphic engine-based generation, generative model-based generation, and data recombination, while data perturbation is divided into image-level and human-level perturbations. Each method is tailored to the unique requirements of human-centric tasks, with some applicable across multiple areas. Our contributions include an extensive literature review, providing deep insights into the influence of these augmentation techniques in human-centric vision and highlighting the nuances of each method. We also discuss open issues and future directions, such as the integration of advanced generative models like Latent Diffusion Models, for creating more realistic and diverse training data. This survey not only encapsulates the current state of data augmentation in human-centric vision but also charts a course for future research, aiming to develop more robust, accurate, and efficient human-centric vision systems.},

In research of contagious diseases, it is widely exploited to analyze their spread mechanisms, especially for preventing COVID-19. Nowadays, transmission dynamics and interventions of COVID-19 have been elaborately established by this method, but its computation performance is seldomly concerned. As it usually suffers from inadequate CPU utilization and poor data locality, optimizing the performance is challenging and important for real-time analyzing its spreading. Results This paper explores approaches to optimize multi-agent simulation for COVID-19 disease. The focus of this work is on the algorithm and data structure designs for improving performance, as well as its parallelization strategies. We propose two successive methods to optimize the computation. We construct a case-focused iteration algorithm to improve data locality, and propose a fast data-mapping scheme called hierarchical hash table to accelerate hash operations.

  abstract     = {There are several limitations known in data modeling discipline, which are related directly to the traditionally used data modeling languages expressiveness. The strong limitations of the expressiveness of the existing well known data modelling languages combined with the lack of a very general universal data modeling language have negative impact to modelling naturalness. As the result of mentioned limits the reality must be transformed to avoid (workaround) the limits introduced by the modelling language. In turn, the transformation process requires extra effort. The problem is strengthened by the lack of mechanisms, which can be used to measure the expressiveness of a particular data modeling language. Some limitations of the existing data modeling languages result from both their metamodel (abstract syntax) and model (metamodel instance) graph-like structure constraints. This kind of limits also has negative impact to a domain-specific modeling naturalness. The paper addresses all problems mentioned above. The problems can be solved with the help of the EGG data modeling language introduced in the paper. First, a universal and customizable EGG data modeling language together with the customization mechanisms (extensions and generalizations) is introduced. According to the first usage scenario the EGG may be applied for domain-specific data modelling tasks in place of other data modeling languages. Second, the paper proposes and applies (for some data modeling languages: RDF, XML, RDBM, UML and AOM) a novel concept of measuring and comparing data modelling languages via mapping their metamodels to the EGG metamodel. So, according to the second usage scenario the EGG metamodel can be used as a reference metamodel for the data modeling language expressiveness comparative studies. It may also support the decision process when a data modeling language must be chosen for a particular domain-specific data modeling task. Third, the EGG introduced in the paper helps to avoid transforming reality to the needs resulting from the data modeling language as the EGG is general enough for the domain data modeling task. Complete abstract syntax of the Extended Generalized Graph is introduced and is expressed through its implementations in terms of the Association-Oriented Metamodel and the Unified Modeling Language. Semantics of each syntactical category of abstract syntax is described. Two complete concrete syntaxes for the Extended Generalized Graph are also introduced in the paper. The case studies related to both social network and knowledge modeling illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the EGG. Abstract syntax is compared to several other metamodels. The comparative study of the case study models created first in different metamodels and then expressed in the Extended Generalized Graph metamodel is summarized quantitatively in the form of a proposed measure.},

However, GCM outputs often deviate from the observed climatological data and therefore need bias correction (BC) before they are used for impact studies. While there are several BC methods, BCs considering frequency, intensity and distribution of rainfall are few. This study proposes a BC method which focuses on separately correcting the frequency, intensity and distribution of precipitation. This BC was performed on high-resolution daily precipitation simulations of Meteorological Research Institute-Atmospheric General Circulation Model Version 3.2 with a 20-km grid size (MRI-AGCM3-2-S) model which is part of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) on Netravati basin, a tropical river basin in India. The historical rain gauge station data was considered for testing the effectiveness of the BC method applied. The quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, Taylor diagram, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination ( R ^2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), percentage bias (PBIAS) and correlation coefficient ( R ) are employed for the evaluation of the BC method. Higher R and R ^2 and lower RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values were observed for the bias-corrected GCM data than raw simulation. The PBIAS reduced from 15.6 to 6},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to create, using big data from user content in retail marketing, a prediction approach to predicting consumer behavior. Based on an approach with two key components, prediction is achievable. The first step is accurate big data analytics of user-generated material, highlighting the essential information and monitoring changes in user behavior (posting and purchasing) as a result of shifting value proposition variables. Second, it involves the inclusion of specialists and seasoned marketers in sociological surveys that use large samples of respondents and the probabilistic method. The value proposition structure was broken down into ten components that influence the rhetoric of user content using the stratification approach. The competitive advantages or business objectives of stores, in turn, made clear the essential categories of user content. The study focuses on Russia’s most widely used digital trading platforms. The study developed an approach to the expert prediction of consumer behavior following changes in content quality and highlighted efficient digital tools for doing so using the sociological technique. The methodology for expert forecasting of consumer behavior amid changes in the quality of user content was developed using empirical, probabilistic, and sociological methods. The competitive advantage or goal of an online store was shown to be the most important element in altering consumer behavior. The proposed expert prediction methodology based on the likelihood matrix of a decline in customer conversion rates due to user content degradation is the study’s scientific contribution.},

  abstract     = {In low resource children automatic speech recognition (ASR) the performance is degraded due to limited acoustic and speaker variability available in small datasets. In this paper, we propose a spectral warping based data augmentation method to capture more acoustic and speaker variability. This is carried out by warping the linear prediction (LP) spectra computed from speech data. The warped LP spectra computed in a frame-based manner are used with the corresponding LP residuals to synthesize speech to capture more variability. The proposed augmentation method is shown to improve the ASR system performance over the baseline system. We have compared the proposed method with four well-known data augmentation methods: pitch scaling, speaking rate, SpecAug and vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP), and found that the proposed method performs the best. Further, we have combined the proposed method with these existing data augmentation methods to improve the ASR system performance even more. The combined system consisting of the original data, VTLP, SpecAug and the proposed spectral warping method gave the best performance by a relative word error rate reduction of 32.13},

In process models, data is commonly represented by data objects, and data object states are employed as abstractions from concrete properties of data objects. However, there is little agreement on how those states can actually be defined. This paper proposes a framework for the definition of data object states. The framework generalizes and consolidates the dimensions that make up data object states in related work. It supports concurrent states to capture different perspectives on a given object. The work is evaluated by (i) mapping the state definitions of existing approaches to the framework to demonstrate its unifying nature, and (ii) a prototypical implementation based on decision tables showcasing the applicability of the framework.},

The findings were threefold; first we validated the data analytics capabilities necessary for PPO business models synthesised from literature with the selected case companies. Second, two additional data analytics capabilities, namely capability to influence how performance is measured and analysed, and capability to simulate the solution’s financial performance) were identified. Finally, this study presents two different roadmaps on how data analytics capabilities have been developed. The study findings suggest that remote monitoring capability is among the most critical data analytics capability to initiate a PPO business model in the equipment manufacturing industry.

  abstract     = {Studies related to the impact of Black Carbon (BC) aerosols on weather phenomena like monsoon breaks, winter fog events, and pre-monsoon heatwaves are sparse in India. This study fills the gap of observational information of BC aerosols and their relationship with meteorological phenomena. We examined the interaction between BC aerosols and precipitation during the monsoon’s active-break cycle, a critical period for agriculture, water resources, and weather patterns. Data from stations in rural and urban areas provided contrasting seasonal and diurnal variation. The diurnal pattern is closely linked to anthropogenic activities and meteorological factors. The study examines significant diurnal and seasonal variation in relation to local and regional meteorological variation. BC concentrations show distinct bimodal diurnal patterns, with major peak in the evening, between 2000 to 2300 h IST and secondary peak in the morning between 0700 to 0900 h IST. Seasonal variations show the lowest BC levels during the monsoon due to efficient wet scavenging, while the highest levels occur during the post-monsoon, primarily from agricultural burning. Meteorological factors like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed significantly influence BC dynamics. Higher temperatures and lower humidity increase BC levels, while rainfall reduces them, and wind disperses BC aerosols, affecting their concentration and distribution. Analysis of pre-monsoon heatwaves, winter fog events, and monsoon conditions reveals the complex interplay between BC aerosols and weather patterns. Local meteorological factors such as temperature inversions and wind patterns significantly influence the BC impact on weather phenomena. This research enhances the understanding of BC pollution and its diverse effects on weather and climate, emphasizing the importance of integrating meteorological factors into air quality management and policymaking. It lays the groundwork for developing targeted strategies to mitigate BC’s adverse effects on health and the environment in India.},

  abstract     = {Modern dynamic models of traffic flow and especially dynamic network loading (DNL) models are a powerful approach to predict traffic flow dynamics in a short-term sense (minutes or hours ahead). Such models should be the core element of any intelligent transportation system to make safer and smarter use of transport networks. Nowadays a variety of traffic data is becoming more and more accurate and available. Online traffic data can be incorporated in DNL model to take into account nonrecurring events (e.g. accidents, road closures or unexpected bad weather conditions). This idea can increase the accuracy of short-term prediction and make traffic flow management more effective. In our research we suggest to combine traditional model-driven approach with a data-driven prediction. As a DNL model we use the link transmission model in cooperation with a dynamic user equilibrium algorithm to identify the routes. Traffic data are the values of speed and flow with a 5-minutes time step, obtained from stationary road sensors. We use the rolling horizon approach, that is, every 5-minutes model constructs 1-hour forecast incorporating actual sensor data. Moreover, we use methods of machine learning to predict the sensor data for the next hour and take it into account while calcu- lating the forecast for the current hour ahead.},

  abstract     = {Data, information and information sharing are key aspects of development in globalized economies. Developing and developed economies need a cross pollination of information in order to align their development strategies. However, there exists a mismatch between information sharing among technocrats of technology and would be users of the generated data, let alone academia and practice. In efforts to improve services through smart city strategies, there is need to harness wireless sensor networks that generate and provide enormous amount of data referred to as big data in a socio-technical approach since smart city is a socio-technical challenge itself. This paper analyses the opportunities and challenges for use of intelligent systems and big data for reaching the contemporary Smart City strategy in a bid to improve service delivery to the citizens and residents. The methodology of this paper is through literature search, policy analysis and aligns to empirical participatory design results from the previous PhD study in order to inform Smart City initiatives in a developing country context case study. Based on findings, this paper proposes human-like Internet of Things (IoTs) that generate big data to ensure fitness and value addition within a given smart city context. The paper asserts that technology is a component of socio-technical ecosystem and therefore big data-oriented system developments should focus on data integration within a social and cultural context.},

  abstract     = {Data observability is the ability of the whole monitoring and understanding of data quality and lineage to identify and address data issues early. This is becoming increasingly important as organizations collect and store more data; also the ingestion process and the data itself become more complex. This paper shows the first iteration of BDS-Analytics, a PySpark library born from the empirical experiences of data engineers and data scientists in projects where BDS S.P.A, a Chilean Big Data Consulting firm, has been working. We present the initial scenario detected in different Big Data initiatives, where data quality and data observability criteria, in addition to the difficulty of their implementation, have been discussed. The proposed library includes PySpark functions that can solve the common requirements of exploratory data analysis and primary data quality, and the potential to add new features or tools for a stronger study of the data. In addition, this research presents a qualitative evaluation that includes surveys with professionals in the area and seeks to evaluate issues such as Effort Estimation, Usability, and Quality. The main contributions of this research are (1) the development of a PySpark library and its key capabilities, and (2) the evaluation process of the library in a real industrial environment.},

With the expansion of universal formats for describing the structure of public transport systems, such as GTFS or Transmodel, the use of these data has expanded far beyond the public transport domain. On the other hand, the effort to use these data encounters the problem of its processing, storage and integration with the structure of the transport system due to the volume and speed of data generation from real operations. These problems are even more evident in the case of further use of these data as inputs for machine learning, or data mining, where integration of data from different systems into a single model is necessary. The purpose of this paper was to design a method by the which big data from real operations could be integrated with the changing structure of the transport system so that this data could be stored long term without loss of granularity, or entropy value. As a result, we proposed a data model with big data transformation algorithm, whose functionality has been verified in testing over the public transport system of the second largest city in the Czech Republic.},

This framework incorporates the use of Decision Model and Notation (DMN) for enhanced comprehensibility and normalization to simplify decision tables. The framework's efficacy was tested by adapting the C4.5 algorithm to the DM45 algorithm. The proposed adaptations include (1) the utilization of a decision log, (2) ensure an unpruned decision tree, (3) the generation DMN, and (4) normalize decision table. Future research can focus on supporting on practitioners in modeling decisions, ensuring their decision-making is compliant, and suggesting improvements to the modeled decisions. Another future research direction is to explore the ability to process unstructured data as input for the discovery of decisions.},

Failure time of antenna coils, circuit boards, and power supply have been recorded. Therefore, failure mode and failure mechanism can be analyzed of the tool. Secondly, a fault analysis model of electromagnetic wave LWD tool based on Weibull distribution model has been built up, and by using this fault analysis model the reliable life and the remaining useful life of antenna system can be calculated. The last, the goodness-of-fit test can be operated to Weibull distribution model by using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Study results show that the reliability and the law of fault occurrence of electromagnetic wave LWD tool can be directly reflected.

  abstract     = {Power system transient stability assessment is the key to the safe and stable operation of power grids. As the complexity and volatility of power grid operation modes continue to climb, the application of both deterministic and probabilistic assessment methods in different scenarios is limited. Transient stability assessment in conventional scenarios using deterministic physical models is too slow and the calculations are too absolute for decision making such as risk assessment, while in extreme cases, where there is less historical data and the mode of operation fluctuates, the use of probabilistic models can lead to large biases. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid model-data driven approach for transient stability assessment of power system. Firstly, scenario identification is performed based on K-means clustering. Secondly, in general scenarios, the probabilistic assessment method of transient stability based on gaussian process regression (GPR) for particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used; and in extreme scenarios, the deterministic assessment method based on time-domain simulation is used. Finally, the validity of the method proposed in this paper is verified in IEEE39 node system.},

Build an analysis model of spatial distribution, time change and attribute characteristic parameters of natural resource big data response, obtain the characteristic quantity of cross-space coverage of natural resource change and state, establish the middle platform architecture system of resource big data by the method of natural resource collaborative perception, and realize the joint acquisition of natural resource big data by the method of aviation acquisition, ground observation and professional monitoring. Build a natural resources spatio-temporal database with business elements connected, rich thematic information and multi-scale integration, and solve the problems of interconnection, dynamic convergence and effective integration of multi-source business information of natural resources big data. Through high-level spatio-temporal cognition and processing, the spatio-temporal distribution law of natural resources can be obtained, and the full-cycle sharing of resource big data can be realized. The test results show that this method has good time–space coupling and strong conflict coordination and resolution ability for the full-cycle sharing of resource big data, and it has a good application value in the simulation, optimization and regulation of different scenarios of natural resources development, utilization and protection.},

From the sample data of the empirical seismic-damage observations, 1409 simply supported girder bridges, 107 continuous girder bridges, and 612 arch bridges were selected. The latest version of the Chinese seismic intensity standard was utilized to evaluate the fragility of bridge samples in different macroseismic intensity zones, and the empirical vulnerability matrix and multidimensional regression comparison model of typical bridge clusters were developed. Taking the bridge length, the coordinate azimuth of the bridge location, the number of spans, the geometric form of the pier columns, and the type of bearings and foundations as the single factors influencing vulnerability and assuming (i) the line type and bridge length, (ii) the types of pier column and foundation, and (iii) the number of spans, the type of bearings, foundations, and linearity as the coupled factors influencing vulnerability, the aforementioned typical bridges were subjected to comparative vulnerability analysis. Innovative fragility regression and probability comparison models of typical bridges were developed considering the influence of multiple factor coupling. A novel vulnerability evaluation model was proposed based on the characteristic parameters and damage grade of bridge clusters in the umbrella earthquake area, and the model was optimized and verified by using the typical bridge database of the Wenchuan earthquake.},

  abstract     = {Modelling and applying multivariate distributions is an important topic in ecology. In particular in plant ecology, the multidimensional nature of plant traits comes with challenges such as wide ranges in observations as well as correlations between several characteristics. In other disciplines (e.g., finances and economics), copulas have been proven as a valuable tool for modelling multivariate distributions. However, applications in ecology are still rarely used. Here, we present a copula-based methodology of fitting multivariate distributions to ecological data. We used product copula models to fit multidimensional plant traits, on example of observations from the global trait database TRY. The fitting procedure is split into two parts: fitting the marginal distributions and fitting the copula. We found that product copulas are well suited to model ecological data as they have the advantage of being asymmetric (similar to the observed data). Challenges in the fitting were mainly addressed to limited amount of data. In view of growing global databases, we conclude that copula modelling provides a great potential for ecological modelling.},

Studying the dynamic evolution of cancer and revealing the mechanisms of cancer progression based on experimental data is an important topic. In this study, we aim to employ a data-driven energy landscape approach to analyze the dynamic evolution of cancer. We take Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) as an example. From the energy landscape, we introduce two quantitative indicators (transition probability and barrier height) to study critical shifts in KIRC cancer evolution, including cancer onset and progression, and identify critical genes involved in these transitions. Our results successfully identify crucial genes that either promote or inhibit these transition processes in KIRC. We also conduct a comprehensive biological function analysis on these genes, validating the accuracy and reliability of our predictions. This work has implications for discovering new biomarkers, drug targets, and cancer treatment strategies in KIRC.},

  abstract     = {Services are flourishing drastically both on the Internet and in the real world. In addition, services have become much more interconnected to facilitate transboundary business collaboration to create and deliver distinct new values to customers. Various service ecosystems come into being and are increasingly becoming a focus in both research and practice. However, due to the lack of widely recognized service ecosystem models and sufficient real data for constructing such models, existing studies on service ecosystems are limited to a very narrow scope and cannot effectively guide the design, optimization, and evolution of service ecosystems. In this paper, we first propose a multilayer network-based service ecosystem model (MSEM), which covers a variety of service-related elements, including stakeholders, channels, functional and nonfunctional features, and domains, and more importantly, structural and evolutionary relations between them. “Events” are introduced to describe the triggers of service ecosystem evolution. Then, we propose a data-driven approach for constructing MSEM from public media news and external data sources. Experiments conducted on real news corpora show that compared with other approaches, our approach can construct large-scale models for real-world service ecosystems with lower cost and higher efficiency.},

In order to answer this question, we collect the arriving times of passengers from online car-hailing platform in Beijing, and then analyze the collected data based on stochastic renewal process and uncertain renewal process. Finally, by comparing samples and confidence intervals of the total numbers of passengers arriving on the online car-hailing platform under two mathematical systems, we come to the conclusion that the queueing systems in the real world are uncertain rather than random.},

However, the presence of multiple disciplines poses challenges concerning computational efforts and system organizational integration. This paper introduces a novel MDO system by integrating a directly manipulated free-form deformation (DFFD) method and a data-driven model with pre-screening strategy. The DFFD enables precise deformation of compressor surfaces with fewer control points to reduce variables, while data-driven models can significantly accelerate the convergence of complex multi-objective optimization problems. It is applied to an axial compressor to enhance its aerodynamic and aeroelastic performance. A fluid-domain mesh-based method is employed to construct the blade finite element model, addressing the fluid–structure interface interpolation. By progressively increasing the outlet pressure to search the compressor near surge point, the prediction accuracy of surge margin during the optimization process is effectively improved. Compared to the prototype, the isentropic efficiency of optimized compressor at the design point and peak increases by 1.22 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively, and the surge margin improves by 3.23},

  abstract     = {Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present, and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (i.e., values of properties of interest). DataTime offers a unifying interface to query the past, present, and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides (i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, (ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system’s sensors, and (iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can be used for managing data from the past, the present, and the future and facilitate the development of digital twins.},

  abstract     = {This study adopts a multidimensional approach to examining sustainability reporting practices among notebook manufacturers, integrating traditional corporate sustainability reports with social media data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. Using advanced machine learning techniques, including multi-label classification and BERT-based sentiment analysis, the research highlights the key environmental, social, and economic dimensions that consumers prioritize. The findings reveal a significant misalignment between consumer concerns, reflected in social media discourse, and the focus of corporate sustainability reports. While companies emphasize environmental impacts and supply chain management, consumers prioritize product reliability, community obligations, and educational initiatives. This gap indicates a need for companies to realign their sustainability strategies to better meet consumer expectations, emphasizing trust-building, community engagement, and educational efforts. Despite these differences, the study also identifies shared concerns between consumers and producers, such as environmental impacts, supply chain sustainability, and transparency in sustainability claims. Based on these insights, the study recommends fostering transparent communication, engaging in inclusive dialogue, and committing to accountable actions across all sustainability dimensions. By aligning corporate reporting with consumer expectations, this research provides guidance to help companies advance towards a circular economy and enhance Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in the electronics industry, ultimately benefiting both companies and consumers in the pursuit of a more sustainable future.},

  abstract     = {For many industries, 2020 has been a turbulent year, but data analytics has been one field that has observed steady and substantial growth amid economic and market instability. We find ourselves in a very paradoxical position in 2020. A builder cannot properly build a house without the right instruments or materials, and a business cannot make the best decisions without the right data and consumer insights. The rapidly changing demands of customers are forcing businesses in all industries to continually spindle their strategies so as to remain competitive and drive sales—and data and analytics are the best way to do this. On the one side, to survive the global health crisis, we are told to separate ourselves socially. The hyperconnected world, on the other hand, helps us to communicate even more easily and more effectively, exchanging knowledge and ideas from the comfort of our homes across the world. This, in turn, urges industries to build tools to help us better explain concepts and encourage each professional to make a valid contribution. Such technologies certainly did not arise just this year, but they are affecting many areas of business and life now, and there is no exception to data analytics. This chapter presents the different trends that are gaining momentum in the industry during post-COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Multi-party business processes rely on the collaboration of various players in a decentralized setting. Blockchain technology can facilitate the automation of these processes, even in cases where trust among participants is limited. Transactions are stored in a ledger, a replica of which is retained by every node of the blockchain network. The operations saved thereby are thus publicly accessible. While this enhances transparency, reliability, and persistence, it hinders the utilization of public blockchains for process automation as it violates typical confidentiality requirements in corporate settings. In this paper, we propose MARTSIA : A Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications . MARTSIA enables precise control over process data at the level of message parts. Based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (MA-ABE), MARTSIA realizes a number of desirable properties, including confidentiality, transparency, and auditability. We implemented our approach in proof-of-concept prototypes, with which we conduct a case study in the area of supply chain management. Also, we show the integration of MARTSIA with a state-of-the-art blockchain-based process execution engine to secure the data flow.},

Compared to statistical modeling approaches, machine learning makes fewer explicit assumptions about data structures, such as linearity. Consequently, the parameters of machine learning models usually cannot be easily related to the data generating process. To learn about the modeled relationships, partial dependence (PD) plots and permutation feature importance (PFI) are often used as interpretation methods. However, PD and PFI lack a theory that relates them to the data generating process. We formalize PD and PFI as statistical estimators of ground truth estimands rooted in the data generating process. We show that PD and PFI estimates deviate from this ground truth not only due to statistical biases, but also due to learner variance and Monte Carlo approximation errors. To account for these uncertainties in PD and PFI estimation, we propose the learner-PD and the learner-PFI based on model refits and propose corrected variance and confidence interval estimators.},

  abstract     = {Due to the growing trend towards miniaturization, small-scale manufacturing processes have become widely used in various engineering fields to manufacture miniaturized products. These processes generally exhibit complex size effects, making the behavior of materials highly dependent on their geometric dimensions. As a result, accurate understanding and modeling of such effects are crucial for optimizing manufacturing outcomes and achieving high-performance final products. To this end, advanced gradient-enhanced plasticity theories have emerged as powerful tools for capturing these complex phenomena, offering a level of accuracy significantly greater than that provided by classical plasticity approaches. However, these advanced theories often require the identification of a large number of material parameters, which poses a significant challenge due to limited experimental data at small scales and high computation costs. The present paper aims at evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of various optimization techniques, including evolutionary algorithm, response surface methodology and Bayesian optimization, in identifying the material parameter of a recent flexible gradient-enhanced plasticity model developed by the authors. The paper findings represent an attempt to bridge the gap between advanced material behavior theories and their practical industrial applications, by offering insights into efficient and reliable material parameter identification procedures.},

In nine institutions and hundreds of departments and majors, Vietnam National University in Hanoi has around 2,500 researchers. Thus, knowledge management manages massive amounts of fragmented data and knowledge from many departments, disciplines, multidisciplines, geographies, and unevenly distributed systems. We propose a data fabric strategy for managing university knowledge by integrating and harmonizing fragmented data across systems and sources. Data-driven decision making promotes collective intelligence by creating a unified and complete picture of institutional knowledge. The data fabric technique powers vDFKM, a knowledge management platform that goes beyond metadata and the knowledge graph paradigm in integrating, exploiting, and reusing knowledge. The paradigm includes KM-based Applications, KM Coordinator, and Runtime and Data Infrastructure. A VNU Digital Knowledge Hub (VNU-DKH) prototype promotes the vDFKM technique. Initial experimental findings show that VNU-DKH can model knowledge representation of learning resources more efficiently and improve knowledge integration across universities.},

It models the production resources, such as steel billets, slabs or coils, production equipment, such as a continuous casting machine or a hot rolling mill, and is capable of representing the tracking uncertainty characteristic of the production of steel long products. A property graph representation of the involved entities is used, where not only each entity is typed, but also the links between entities. The model has been developed as part of a digital twin software platform in the CAPRI project and serves as documentation for the application programming interfaces. A decision support system for through-process quality control is being realised as the main application based on the platform.},

  abstract     = {Data catalogs are an established tool to integrate heterogeneous data, enrich raw data with semantic meaningful metadata, and make data easily searchable, maintainable, and shareable. This helps, for instance, data scientists to manage large data sets, which are often required for state-of-the-art artificial intelligence research. Driven by the increasing computing demand of these data-intensive projects, High-performance Computing (HPC) providers have to address the specific demands of these projects to attract this new user group to HPC systems. One particularly challenging domain are the life sciences working with highly-regulated, sensitive health data. This paper presents a workflow to deploy on-demand Elasticsearch (ES) clusters in user space on HPC systems, providing a backend for direct usage or user-defined, higher-order data catalog functionalities. Therewith, it augments the capabilities of a parallel file system by allowing processing of user-defined metadata. Two different encryption techniques are presented and used in two different use cases to systematically benchmark the developed setup, show its general scalability, and highlight important considerations when adapting it to a new use case. It is shown, that scaling out ES clusters has to be done using thorough data and workload modeling since larger clusters can be either beneficial or harmful to different workloads.},

  abstract     = {Chlorine is the most common disinfectant in drinking water worldwide, and the free residual chlorine concentration has been stipulated at least 0.1 mg/L according to Japanese drinking water standard to ensure disinfection efficacy during distribution. In addition, Japan is also applying approximately 0.4 mg/L chlorine at treatment plants to supply tasty drinkable water to residents. Although a concentration lower than 0.4 mg/L can help avoid an unpleasant chlorine taste in the supply water, it raises challenges for maintaining residual chlorine greater than the standard throughout distribution pipelines. The chlorine concentration decreases along distribution pipes because of bulk decay and wall decay. These decays depend on the initial chlorine concentration, temperature, time, pipe material, etc. Therefore, bottle tests with the Arrhenius theory were set up on the water at the distribution inlet in the Chibata district in Kosai city, Japan at various temperatures and times to measure the bulk decay coefficient. A literature review and root square mean error matching field data were conducted to estimate the wall decay coefficient. These decay coefficients were input into EPANET 2.2 to simulate water quality using smart water meters’ hourly consumption data. Therefore, the points where chlorine concentrations were below the standard could be hourly estimated.},

  abstract     = {Serious games are software applications with an explicit educational objective that have been thoroughly thought out and designed as a learning instrument or tool. They allow the user to experience situations similar to real life and learn from their mistakes through immediate feedback. These games have been developed in various fields, including business, industry, marketing, health, government, among others. For instance, some are used for cognitive training in human beings, where attention and memory are fundamental axes during the various stages of the human life cycle. In this context, the “memory match game” is a card game where many pairs of cards are laid face down, and its objective is to match pairs in the lowest time and with the minimum number of wrong clicks. This information is registered and stored along with the player’s sociodemographic information. Thus, this article aims to analyze the dataset, applying clustering techniques in order to find behavioral patterns. The age variable was used to generate 4 age groups that served as the basis for applying the unsupervised machine learning algorithm, k-means. The results show the behavior of the data in relation to the age groups, it is evident that the more experience the players gain, times and scores improve, regardless of age.},

Therefore significant research efforts by historians, demographers, population health scientists and others have been started in the past with the aim of making such data collections digitally available, first on the basis of images and then as readily available repositories of transcribed data in electronically queryable formats. For the purpose of extracting data from the Irish Civil registers of deaths in the DBDIrl 1864-1922 project ( https://www.dbdirl.com ), an AI-ML Data Analytics Pipeline was proposed as a working approach validated on a subset of the data. However, the pipeline requires manual steps and it is not applicable as is on similar datasets without significant modifications to its inner workings. We are currently transforming this prototyped, single purpose product to a modular, fully automated workflow, intended to be used and reconfigured for new data in a low-code/no-code fashion by domain experts like historians. We explain our adopted analysis and refactoring process, illustrate it on part of the pipeline, including how we faced obstacles and handled pitfalls. We also evaluate its potential to become a methodical approach to transforming an interactive program to a fully automated process, in a low-code/no-code workflow style, that can be easily reused, reconfigured and extended to be able to tailor it to other datasets as needed.},

$$t_{\textrm{k}}$$
 t k to t and t to 
$$t_{\textrm{k}+1}$$
 t k + 1 , which not only relaxes the monotonic constraint but would also not impose the terms as positive definite. By employing the concept of looped-functional, a new exponential TSLF is introducing the exponents 
$$e^{2\alpha (t-t_{\textrm{k}})},$$
 e 2 α ( t - t k ) , 
$$\frac{e^{2\alpha (t_{\textrm{k}+1}-t)}-1}{2\alpha }$$
 e 2 α ( t k + 1 - t ) - 1 2 α , and 
$$\frac{e^{-2\alpha (t-t_{\textrm{k}})}-1}{2\alpha }$$
 e - 2 α ( t - t k ) - 1 2 α , thereby enhancing the control performance, design flexibility and also it contains the more actual sampling information of system states. Next, the new exponentially stable lemma is derived from the fuzzy SDC system with an external disturbance. To this end, the time derivatives of exponential TSLF-based Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, some stabilization criteria exist in formulating linear matrix inequalities to secure the system is exponentially stable under MFD H

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, meteorological datasets from remote sensing techniques in agricultural and water resources management have been used by various researchers and managers. Based on the literature, meteorological datasets are not more accurate than synoptic stations, but their various advantages, such as spatial coverage, time coverage, accessibility, and free use, have made these techniques superior, and sometimes we can use them instead of synoptic stations. In this study, we used four meteorological datasets, including Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series (CRU TS), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Agricultural National Aeronautics and Space Administration Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (AgMERRA), Agricultural Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (AgCFSR), to estimate climate variables, i.e., precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature, and crop variables, i.e., reference evapotranspiration, irrigation requirement, biomass, and yield of maize, in Qazvin Province of Iran during 1980–2009. At first, data were gathered from the four meteorological datasets and synoptic station in this province, and climate variables were calculated. Then, after using the AquaCrop model to calculate the crop variables, we compared the results of the synoptic station and meteorological datasets. All the four meteorological datasets showed strong performance for estimating climate variables. AgMERRA and AgCFSR had more accurate estimations for precipitation and maximum temperature. However, their normalized root mean square error was inferior to CRU for minimum temperature. Furthermore, they were all very efficient for estimating the biomass and yield of maize in this province. For reference evapotranspiration and irrigation requirement CRU TS and GPCC were the most efficient rather than AgMERRA and AgCFSR. But for the estimation of biomass and yield, all the four meteorological datasets were reliable. To sum up, GPCC and AgCFSR were the two best datasets in this study. This study suggests the use of meteorological datasets in water resource management and agricultural management to monitor past changes and estimate recent trends.},

The analysis identified the overall temporal development trend of UUS planning and the research hot spots, namely, the primary use of UUS and UUS planning technology. Additionally, the study identified academic collaborative relationships through country and institution co-occurrence network analysis. The diversified development philosophy, planning systems, key planning scenarios, and data-driven technology pertaining to UUS planning have been extracted through keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Moreover, the planning systems, planning management, and planning practices for UUS in various countries, including Singapore, Japan, Finland, Canada, and China, were also systematically reviewed. By doing so, the worldwide UUS planning evolution has been identified. The paradigm shift for UUS planning has been clarified, involving technical method, result form, control mode, and control elements. Furthermore, the conceptual data-driven framework for UUS planning, which orients multiple development concepts, has been proposed to meet the requirement of next frontier development.},

  abstract     = {Designing and developing distributed cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) is a time-consuming, complex, and error-prone process. These systems are typically heterogeneous, i.e., they consist of multiple components implemented with different languages and development tools. One of the main problems nowadays in CPPS implementation is enabling security mechanisms by design while reducing the complexity and increasing the system’s maintainability. Adopting the IEC 61499 standard is an excellent approach to tackle these challenges by enabling the design, deployment, and management of CPPS in a model-based engineering methodology. We propose a method for CPPS design based on the IEC 61499 standard. The method allows designers to embed a bio-inspired anomaly-based host intrusion detection system (A-HIDS) in Edge devices. This A-HIDS is based on the incremental Dendritic Cell Algorithm (iDCA) and can analyze OPC UA network data exchanged between the Edge devices and detect attacks that target the CPPS’ Edge layer. This study’s findings have practical implications on the industrial security community by making novel contributions to the intrusion detection problem in CPPS considering immune-inspired solutions, and cost-effective security by design system implementation. According to the experimental data, the proposed solution can dramatically reduce design and code complexity while improving application maintainability and successfully detecting network attacks without negatively impacting the performance of the CPPS Edge devices.},

  abstract     = {The second decade of the twenty-first century witnessed a new challenge in the handling of microscopy data. Big data, data deluge, large data, data compliance, data analytics, data integrity, data interoperability, data retention and data lifecycle are terms that have introduced themselves to the electron microscopy sciences. This is largely attributed to the booming development of new microscopy hardware tools. As a result, large digital image files with an average size of one terabyte within one single acquisition session is not uncommon nowadays, especially in the field of cryogenic electron microscopy. This brings along numerous challenges in data transfer, compute and management. In this review, we will discuss in detail the current state of international knowledge on big data in contemporary electron microscopy and how big data can be transferred, computed and managed efficiently and sustainably. Workflows, solutions, approaches and suggestions will be provided, with the example of the latest experiences in Australia. Finally, important principles such as data integrity, data lifetime and the FAIR and CARE principles will be considered.},

  abstract     = {The intersection of Business Process Management (BPM) and Data Management is critical to improve process interoperability effectiveness. This paper provides a literature review on BPM and data-specific challenges that hinder process interoperability. For that purpose, it introduces the concept of Data Contracts to shift metadata that is typically managed in central data catalogues to the business processes that require this information in an encapsulated form. The research methodology consists of a systematic review of established BPM notations as well as of the development of a conceptual framework. The research goals are (1) to assess to which extent the elements of Data Contracts are covered in established BPM notations and (2) to build a foundation for future research on opportunities of BPM-integrated data contracts to improve effectiveness of process interoperability. The findings show that established BPM languages include only a few elements of Data Contracts, such as relationships between data providers and data consumers. In addition, the conceptual framework indicates that Data Contracts are capable of overcoming data-specific challenges in order to improve process interoperability. Among others, the establishment of data standards between subjects could be fostered and costs connected to data processing could be reduced. The article concludes with a discussion on limitations and further research proposals on strategies to integrate and manage Data Contracts and BPM in business practice.},

  abstract     = {Dataflow process networks (DPNs) are intrinsically data-driven, i.e., node actions are not synchronized among each other and may fire whenever sufficient input operands arrived at a node. While the general model of computation (MoC) of DPNs does not impose further restrictions, many different subclasses of DPNs representing different dataflow MoCs have been considered over time. These classes mainly differ in the kinds of behaviors of the processes. A DPN may be heterogeneous in that different processes in the network belong to different classes of DPNs. A heterogeneous DPN can therefore be effectively used to model and to implement different components of a system with different kinds of processes and, therefore, different dataflow MoCs. This paper presents a model-based design based on different dataflow MoCs including their heterogeneous combinations. In particular, it covers the automatic software synthesis of systems from DPN models. The main objective is to validate, evaluate and compare the artifacts exhibited by different dataflow MoCs at the implementation level of systems under the supervision of a common design tool. Moreover, this work also offers an efficient synthesis method that targets and exploits heterogeneity in DPNs by generating implementations based on the kinds of behaviors of the processes. The proposed synthesis method provides a tool chain including different specialized code generators for specific dataflow MoCs, and a runtime system that finally maps models using a combination of different dataflow MoCs on cross-vendor target hardware.},

In order to provide a more comprehensive mathematical model for dengue, this study proposes a hybrid framework that combines seasonal, environmental, and awareness elements into a compartmentalized model. To clarify complex interactions, network connections are added to the model. This novel model’s progressive development is described in great detail, with thorough answers provided at every turn. Thorough investigations prove the existence and uniqueness of the model, and bifurcation analyses reveal dynamic changes in states with different parameters. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify critical factors and highlight their significant impact. The work concludes with a brief synopsis, findings from the research, and an optimistic forecast for the next advancements.

In addition, the wider use of data from tissue atlases in basic and translational research and in classrooms would benefit from software that facilitates the easy visualization and sharing of the images and the results of their analyses. In this Perspective, we describe the ecosystem of software available for the analysis of tissue images and discuss the need for interactive online guides that help histopathologists make complex images comprehensible to non-specialists. We illustrate this idea via a software interface (Minerva), accessible via web browsers, that integrates multi-omic and tissue-atlas features. We argue that such interactive narrative guides can effectively disseminate digital histology data and aid their interpretation.

  abstract     = {High-yielding traits can potentially improve yield performance under climate change. However, data for these traits are limited to specific field sites. Despite this limitation, field-scale calibrated crop models for high-yielding traits are being applied over large scales using gridded weather and soil datasets. This study investigates the implications of this practice. The SIMPLACE modeling platform was applied using field, 1 km, 25 km, and 50 km input data resolution and sources, with 1881 combinations of three traits [radiation use efficiency (RUE), light extinction coefficient (K), and fruiting efficiency (FE)] for the period 2001–2010 across Germany. Simulations at the grid level were aggregated to the administrative units, enabling the quantification of the aggregation effect. The simulated yield increased by between 1.4 and 3.1 t ha^− 1 with a maximum RUE trait value, compared to a control cultivar. No significant yield improvement (< 0.4 t ha^− 1) was observed with increases in K and FE alone. Utilizing field-scale input data showed the greatest yield improvement per unit increment in RUE. Resolution of water related inputs (soil characteristics and precipitation) had a notably higher impact on simulated yield than of temperature. However, it did not alter the effects of high-yielding traits on yield. Simulated yields were only slightly affected by data aggregation for the different trait combinations. Warm-dry conditions diminished the benefits of high-yielding traits, suggesting that benefits from high-yielding traits depend on environments. The current findings emphasize the critical role of input data resolution and source in quantifying a large-scale impact of high-yielding traits.},

  abstract     = {One challenge in modeling nonlinear dynamic systems involves the uncertainty associated with certain parameters that cannot be directly measured or estimated, along with the complexity of incorporating all relevant physical phenomena into a mathematical model without increasing computational cost. A hybrid twin represents an advanced modeling approach that combines the system’s physics-based mathematical model with the empirical data collected from the real-world system, using data assimilation. This strategy enhances the accuracy and reliability of both estimating the system’s unknown parameters and predicting its overall behavior. Further improvements are achieved by using a reduced-order model, which significantly lowers the computational burden of the entire procedure. In this study, we construct a surrogate model for a Vertical Axis Rotating Machine (VARM) by deploying sparse Proper Generalized Decomposition (sPGD). The model is parametrized in terms of the machine’s unidentified parameters, and we apply the Harmonic-Modal Hybrid (HMH) Frequency Approach to solve for sparse scenarios creating the library of solutions. This is then combined with the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization technique to identify the unknown parameters using the measured shaft displacements of an experimental rig of the machine. The results demonstrate that this method is effective for parameter estimation in complex nonlinear systems and allows for fast computations, whether the unknown force function is specified explicitly or presumed. Precisely estimating a system’s parameters can serve as a crucial indicator for scheduling maintenance or predicting failures.},

However, ensuring the trustworthiness of sensor data utilized by actuators for decision-making is a crucial concern, especially in safety-critical systems that leverage IoT. Untrustworthy data could result in data breaches, system failures, or even loss of life. Therefore, it is essential to specify and analyze the security prerequisites of IoT systems. In this paper, we present SURFING, a requirement language for IoT based on the IoT-LySa process calculus. SURFING allows IoT systems to be specified in terms of their components, communication channels, data flows, and security properties. We also describe the SURFING toolkit, which supports the simulation, and verification of IoT specifications. Furthermore, we have developed a symbolic execution engine for the SURFING toolkit, which enables tracking, navigating, and analyzing data pathways within an IoT specification. This capability helps identify and prevent potential data leaks, tampering, or spoofing. We show the utility of SURFING and its toolkit through a case study involving a street lighting control system.},

  abstract     = {The study discusses how the process information reserves can be used for improving production flexibility on the basis of production component variation control. Building upon the assumption that the data in question describe the functions of the production components as those experience perturbations, we submit that it may be possible to predict the productivity and economic efficiency for new, previously unused control options. We elaborate on the production components that ensure production flexibility, approaching them as a highly autonomous holon. We determine the conditions that make it possible to analyze the holon control options in isolation from controlling all other components. We also suggest a solution to the problem of predicting the employees’ impact on production. Our suggestion is based on limiting the types of impact accessible to a human operator. The study looks at the reasons behind the uncertainty of production control simulation modeling results, which stem from the peculiarities of the data collected. We propose a criterion for assessing the impact of uncertainty on the productivity indicators’ variation. This study offers a systemic overview of the aspects of a production simulation aimed at assessing the impact of uncertainty on productivity predictions. As an example, we review how uncertainty affects the variation of coke consumption and productivity of a blast furnace, which is ensured by selecting a suitable option for iron ore sinter quality control.},

  abstract     = {Hydraulic permeability and water content are usually measured on-site in wells or laboratory tests and are commonly supplemented with geohydrological inferences from geoelectrical data. Current approaches take advantage of the similarities between the physical processes behind electrical and hydraulic flows and the water distribution in a fully or partially saturated medium, leaving aside the complete transition from saturated to unsaturated media commonly observed in geoelectrical exploration. We hypothesize that the natural spatiotemporal variations in water content influence both electrical and hydraulic data in partially saturated media, and in turn, the hydraulic pressure-driven saturation can be used to unify and increase the sensitivity of both data types to hydraulic permeability. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for integrated hydraulic and electrical data modeling coupled with a pressure-dependent effective saturation curve. Following the adjoint state formalism, we develop the expression of the coupled sensitivity of electrical and hydraulic data to hydraulic permeability. We tested this methodology on three synthetic scenarios of unconfined aquifers to determine how the electrical data can increase the sensitivity of piezometer data to hydraulic permeability in a homogeneous and heterogeneous medium. From these experiments, we found that the electrical data are particularly sensitive to hydraulic permeability in the vadose zone, thus overcoming the lack of sensitivity of typical piezometer data for this zone. We also found that this sensitivity is maximum in the immediacies of the water table, which acts as a natural permeability scanner when accumulated measurements for different hydric stresses are made over time.},

These actions allow operations management to improve prediction, value creation, optimization, and automatization. In this study, we develop a novel methodology based on data-mining techniques and apply it to identify insights regarding the characteristics of new business models in operations management. The data analyzed in the present study are user-generated content from Twitter. The results are validated using the methods based on Computer-Aided Text Analysis. Specifically, a sentimental analysis with TextBlob on which experiments are performed using vector classifier, multinomial naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and random forest classifier is used. Then, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation is applied to separate the sample into topics based on sentiments to calculate keyness and p -value. Finally, these results are analyzed with a textual analysis developed in Python. Based on the results, we identify 8 topics, of which 5 are positive (Automation, Data, Forecasting, Mobile accessibility and Employee experiences), 1 topic is negative (Intelligence Security), and 2 topics are neutral (Operational CRM, Digital teams). The paper concludes with a discussion of the main characteristics of the business models in the OM sector that use DDI.

Our approach surpasses traditional methods by automating data filtering and cleansing, reducing manual effort, ensuring data quality, and facilitating efficient resource utilization.

Structured IDS projects proceed according to process models such as the cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), or the process chain of industrial data science. Because of the process Chain’s transdisciplinary procedure, the participation of different people in the analysis with different tasks and competencies is necessary. Therefore, a concept to define specific roles is required, since it provides unequivocal descriptions of the respective tasks. As no role concept for the process chain of IDS exists, this paper develops and presents a transdisciplinary role concept including the four essential roles: Data engineer, analyst, user, and project manager. These roles are described in terms of their characteristics to enable structured cooperation between them. In addition, this paper presents the AKKORD platform for learning and collaboration, which especially should make an important contribution for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to develop knowledge in the usage of the process chain of IDS. The platform provides the opportunity for the users to train the essential roles with their characteristics in the company through targeted competence development.},

The tool is generic in the sense that any monitoring system can be used for creating monitors. In this paper, we use the internal Scala DSL Daut for programming such data-parameterized state machines and temporal logic. To illustrate MESA/Daut, we present a case study that monitors flights from live U.S. airspace data streams, verifying that they conform to planned routes. With base in the case study, we then perform an extensive empirical study of the potential benefits from monitoring slices of a single property in concurrently executing actors. Due to the overhead of scheduling “small” actors (one for each slice or a small number of slices), it is not obvious that concurrent execution of such is beneficial. However, as a main result, we demonstrate that concurrent monitoring of slices to handle data-carrying events can provide considerable speed gains.},

The Computation API of the sparse polyhedral framework (SPF) provides a single entry point for tools to generate and manipulate polyhedral dataflow graphs, and transform applications. However, when viewing graphs generated for scientific applications there are several barriers. The graphs are large, and manipulating their layout to respect execution order is difficult.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new numerical model developed to assist with Data Interpretation and Numerical Analysis of ionospheric Missions and Observations (DINAMO). DINAMO derives the ionospheric electrostatic potential at low- and mid-latitudes from a two-dimensional dynamo equation and user-specified inputs for the state of the ionosphere and thermosphere (I–T) system. The potential is used to specify the electric fields and associated F -region E × B plasma drifts. Most of the model was written in Python to facilitate the setup of numerical experiments and to engage students in numerical modeling applied to space sciences. Here, we illustrate applications and results of DINAMO in two different analyses. First, DINAMO is used to assess the ability of widely used I–T climatological models (IRI-2016, NRLMSISE-00, and HWM14), when used as drivers, to produce a realistic representation of the low-latitude electrodynamics. In order to evaluate the results, model E × B drifts are compared with observed climatology of the drifts derived from long-term observations made by the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar. We found that the climatological I–T models are able to drive many of the features of the plasma drifts including the diurnal, seasonal, altitudinal and solar cycle variability. We also identified discrepancies between modeled and observed drifts under certain conditions. This is, in particular, the case of vertical equatorial plasma drifts during low solar flux conditions, which were attributed to a poor specification of the E -region neutral wind dynamo. DINAMO is then used to quantify the impact of meridional currents on the morphology of F -region zonal plasma drifts. Analytic representations of the equatorial drifts are commonly used to interpret observations. These representations, however, commonly ignore contributions from meridional currents. Using DINAMO we show that that these currents can modify zonal plasma drifts by up to   16 m/s in the bottom-side post-sunset F -region, and up to   10 m/s between 0700 and 1000 LT for altitudes above 500 km. Finally, DINAMO results show the relationship between the pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) of the vertical drifts and the vertical shear in the zonal plasma drifts with implications for equatorial spread F.},

  abstract     = {Citrus constitutes one of the most important and appreciated fruit crops, cultivated worldwide with an estimated annual production of 120 million tonnes. The amount of citrus genomic data currently available is considerable, and it is continually increasing at an unforeseen speed. Since the first citrus genome sequence was released in 2011, several genomes from relevant citrus species, varieties, and clones have been sequenced using next-generation sequencing technologies. This perspective opens significant opportunities for new and original discoveries based on SNP studies. However, the massive amount of publicly available data poses several challenges requiring further effort. In this work, we present CitrusGenome, a Genome Information System that overcomes these challenges and provides an efficient, user-friendly tool for performing SNP discovery analysis in citrus.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel methodology, called Word Co-occurrence SVN topic model (WCSVNtm), for document clustering and topic modeling in textual datasets. This method represents the corpus as a bipartite network of words and documents to rigorously assess the statistical significance of word co-occurrences within documents and document overlap based on shared vocabulary. By employing the Leiden community detection algorithm to the SVN, distinct communities of words can be identified and interpreted as topics. Similarly, documents can be sorted into groups based on their thematic similarities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing three datasets: a set of 120 Wikipedia articles, the arXiv10 dataset, which consists of 100,000 abstracts from scientific papers, and a sampled subset of 10,000 documents from the original arXiv10. To benchmark our results, we compare our approach with several well-established models in the field of topic modeling and document clustering, including the hierarchical Stochastic Block Model (hSBM), BERTopic, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results show that WCSVNtm achieves competitive performance across all datasets, automatically selecting the number of topics and document clusters, whereas state-of-the-art methods require prior knowledge or additional tuning for optimization. Finally, any advancements in community detection algorithms could further improve our method.},

  abstract     = {A Map is a collection of linear and polygonal geometry lines in 2D space. In an actual Map, these lines act as unique features such as roads, carto, points of interest .etc. This paper focuses on providing a solution to one of the basic, though practical, open problems; There is a need to identify kinks in forming a Road in 2D Maps, which is the linear collection of the lines. The kink in the road is inversely proportional to the number of lines presenting them, which means more number of lines less is the kink. In practical cases, there is a balance between them, which results in the kink on specific points. This paper proposed a technique to identify those points by spline interpolation with length manipulation, where the difference in the interpolated lines with points is calculated, and the threshold is defined accordingly. The novelty of the work is that no practical technique identifies kink in the Real Map data, which is deterministic and can be used with ease as the best knowledge of the authors. With the threshold of 10 cm, for Frankfurt and USA, the identifications were 91 and 83 per cent, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a highly efficient method for the rapid detection and localization of open circuit and short-circuit faults in a single-phase nine-level switched-capacitor multilevel inverter, incorporating fault reconfiguration capabilities. The proposed system leverages data-driven techniques that utilize the inverter voltage signal as raw input data, processed through variable mode decomposition (VMD) for extracting critical information and features from the voltage signal. VMD decomposes the voltage signal into three intrinsic mode functions (IMFs-1 to IMFs-3), with IMF-1 providing essential information for fault analysis due to its high sensitivity to disturbances. IMF-1 is subjected to singular value decomposition to extract singular values, which are then transformed into an analytic signal and fed into a machine learning-based fuzzy inference system (FIS). The FIS accurately detects and localizes faulty switches and triggers the reconfiguration process by activating redundant switches or alternative paths, ensuring that output power is preserved and capacitor voltages remain balanced both pre- and post-fault. The proposed method undergoes a rigorous validation process, including comprehensive and competitive analysis, supported by both extensive experimental and simulation results, which demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed topology.},

  abstract     = {Surrounding rock pressure prediction for fully mechanized coal face (FMCF) roof management and control is of great significance. The key challenge is to effectively combine various factors to evolve the surrounding rock pressure trend with high temporal-spatial correlation and heterogeneity. The hydraulic support load is an important indicator that reflects the change in the surrounding rock pressure. Inspired by the research on 'support-surrounding rock’ and the massive data collected by sensors, this paper proposes a data-driven prediction framework for surrounding rock pressure in FMCFs. The framework includes the multidimensional working condition matrix (MWCM) building module, the hydraulic support group temporal-spatial feature fusion (HTSFF) network, and the adaptive deployment strategy (ADS). The MWCM generating methods of hydraulic support in combination with the mining process and the data quality and quantity requirements of the conventional supervised learning method are weakened by the treatment of missing data adapting to the working conditions. The HTSFF network focuses on capturing the spatial correlation of the surrounding rock pressure along the mining direction and the temporal periodicity along the advancing direction of the FMCF and fully considers the dependencies between them. ADS aims to solve the problem of missing data in model deployment and reduce the interference of abnormal data in the model prediction process by adaptively generating MWCM. The rationality and practicability of various designs of the proposed framework were verified on our dataset. Quantitative experiments show that the average error of the surrounding rock pressure prediction is 1.2406 MPa, and the accuracy, precision, and recall rate of periodic pressure prediction are all above 95},

In this work, climate projections derived from WRF simulations with a spatial resolution of 3 km were used to obtain a novel dataset of 53 bioclimatic indicators, called BICI–ULL (Bioclimatic Indicators in the Canary Islands, University of La Laguna). The regional climate simulations were driven by three CMIP5 models (GFDL–ESM2M, IPSL–CM5A–MR, and MIROC–ESM) over three periods (1980–2009, 2030–2059, 2070–2099) and two emission scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5), to obtain, among others, the standard climatic variables used to generate the bioclimatic indicators: temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity and wind speed.},

  abstract     = {In the big data era which we have entered, the development of smart scheduler has become a necessity. A Distributed Stream Processing System (DSPS) has the role of assigning processing tasks to the available resources (dynamically or not) and route streaming data between them. Smart and efficient task scheduling can reduce latencies and eliminate network congestions. The most commonly used scheduler is the default Storm scheduler, which has proven to have certain disadvantages, like the inability to handle system changes in a dynamic environment. In such cases, rescheduling is necessary. This paper is an extension of a previous work on dynamic task scheduling. In such a scenario, some type of rescheduling is necessary to have the system working in the most efficient way. In this paper, we extend our previous works Souravlas and Anastasiadou (Appl Sci 10(14):4796, 2020); Souravlas et al. (Appl Sci 11(1):61, 2021) and present a mathematical model that offers better balance and produces fewer communication steps. The scheduler is based on the idea of generating larger sets of communication steps among the system nodes, which we call superclasses. Our experiments have shown that this scheme achieves better balancing and reduces the overall latency.},

This assumption has an important role in the estimation of the transition probabilities. When the multi-state model is Markovian, the Aalen–Johansen estimator gives consistent estimators of the transition probabilities but this is no longer the case when the process is non-Markovian. Usually, this assumption is checked including covariates depending on the history. Since the landmark methods of the transition probabilities are free of the Markov assumption, they can also be used to introduce such tests by measuring their discrepancy to Markovian estimators. In this paper, we introduce tests for the Markov assumption and compare them with the usual approach based on the analysis of covariates depending on history through simulations. The methods are also compared with more recent and competitive approaches. Three real data examples are included for illustration of the proposed methods.},

However, this transformation can be complex, as different archetypes of data-driven business models require substantially different business and technical capabilities. While there are manifold contributions to research on technical capability development, an integrated and aligned perspective on both business and technology capabilities for distinct data-driven business model archetypes is needed. This perspective promises to enhance research’s understanding of this transformation and offers guidance for practitioners. As maturity models have proven to be valuable tools in capability development, we follow a design science approach to develop a maturity model for the transformation toward archetypal data-driven business models. To provide an integrated perspective on business and technology capabilities, the maturity model leverages a layered enterprise architecture model. By applying and evaluating in use at two manufacturers, we find two different transformation approaches, namely ‘data first’ and ‘business first’. The resulting insights highlight the model’s integrative perspective’s value for research to improve the understanding of this transformation. For practitioners, the maturity model allows a status quo assessment and derives fields of action to develop the capabilities required for the aspired data-driven business model.},

  abstract     = {Sedimentary depositions from the Mississippi River shape the geologic condition of southeast Louisiana. The region’s soft and highly compressible soil presents a significant challenge for civil infrastructure projects, including the need for ground improvement tasks. Models and observations are used to characterize the soil and predict settlement is a common practice. Accurately characterizing soil compressibility properties is particularly challenging due to the soil’s complex and heterogeneous behavior. Most methods predict consolidation settlement using one-dimensional models whose parameters are estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab procedures. Models describing consolidation behavior are evaluated numerically, analytically, or using approximate methods. More recent studies have shown promising results by exploring the assimilation of field observations to improve accuracies. This approach is based on the premise that both modeling and observation can provide complementary information for prediction, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy of the prediction. In this study, we analyze the field data to evaluate the Asaoka and hyperbolic methods for settlement prediction. Despite being accurate, these methods have limited application in regions and conditions beyond those factored in observational data. To broaden the application of empirical equations, we propose a model-informed empirical approach. Synthetic soil settlement curves are generated based on numerical simulation of soil settlement models by sampling soil geotechnical parameters. Plausible synthetic settlement data is then fitted to empirical models to establish the functional relationship between the empirical coefficient and the geotechnical parameters. Complementing model-generated synthetic data and limited observation provides a viable approach toward timely and reliable consolidation settlement estimation.},

  abstract     = {With the observed significant rise in the use of data across a variety of industries in the modern world, distributed systems are now required to process and consume Big Data. HPCC (High-Performance Computing Clusters) system is an open-source data lake platform built for high-speed large-volume data engineering. Enterprise Control Language (ECL) is a declarative language specifically designed for huge data projects on the HPCC system platform. Large amounts of data are processed on a regular basis using HPCC systems, In the proposed work an approach to understand and interpret the data flow within an ECL program is investigated. The current system renders an XML graph, which shows the operations at dataset level which can be viewed in the ECL Watch, an interactive web application developed by HPCC systems. As the data changes of individual fields within dataset are not represented, the proposed work field level data and dependencies within datasets are tracked and their changes and operations are visualized as a directed acyclic graph for a generic ECL program to understand its data workflow. The core of this project relies on parsing the ECL IR (Intermediate Representation) emitted by the ECL compiler. The IR generated is transformed into graphical format. The system was tested against sample ECL programs available in ECL watch and other programs available in the platform regression tests and it provided a simple easy to comprehend data flow visualization.},

Recognizing the complexities arising from domain-specific or overly broad urban data platforms, the research navigates through the evolutionary trajectory of UIs in urban settings. Introducing the concept of Self-Adaptive User Interfaces (SAUIs), the study emphasizes their dynamic responsiveness to user needs based on contextual data. Through a synthesis of design, models, and data-driven insights, the integration of generative design patterns and model-driven development lays the foundation for culturally sensitive and context-aware UIs. The paper showcases a prototype implementation of an urban data platform and outlines the design concept for the prospective implementation of SAUI. Prospective research endeavors aim to assess these interfaces in real-world scenarios and explore alternative UI design approaches for optimal integration into smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Changes in soil temperature (ST) in the Three River Source Region (TRSR) significantly influence regional climate, ecology, and hydrological processes. However, existing models and reanalysis data exhibit considerable deviations in ST due to limitations in physical processes and parameterization schemes. To address this issue, we developed a new ST dataset using the Random Forest method (RFST), integrating observed ST data with relevant gridded datasets. RFST provides monthly ST data at nine layers with a spatial resolution of 0.01° × 0.01° from 1982 to 2015. Validation against two soil observation networks and six meteorological stations shows that the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of RFST exceeds 0.7 at all depths. Compared to ERA5 and CRA40, RFST corrects the cold bias, improves NSE, and reduces RMSE from 4 °C-8 °C to 1 °C-2 °C. RFST not only corrects the underestimation of ST and its warming rate but also aligns more closely with observed values for surface freezing and thawing indices as well as soil freeze-thaw periods, providing a more accurate representation of soil thermal conditions in the TRSR.},

Daily, countless regex generation queries are posted on online Q   A platforms such as StackOverflow ( https://quora.com ) and Quora ( https://stackoverflow.com ). Existing automatic regex synthesis methods demand concretely designed, multimodal datasets for optimal performance. Unfortunately, publicly available datasets even for resource-rich languages like English are often model-specific and incomplete, potentially hindering the efficiency and accurateness of regex synthesis methods. This issue is worsened for resource-poor languages such as Standard Urdu and Roman Urdu. In this paper, we present a novel, benchmark Roman Urdu dataset with 900 words and a novel Roman Urdu lexicon of 4225 words, annotated and labeled, to address the unmet needs of regex synthesis methods. Equipping these methods with a proficient dataset can lead to more fruitful regex generation.},

Companies are pressured to streamline and automate this crucial task through digital workflows and specialized IT-based assistance systems. This has recently piqued the interest of researchers working in different disciplines, such as intelligent systems, machine learning, and natural language processing. The article describes the latest results of our long-term research program on IT-based support for corporate compliance management, offering insights for these, and other disciplines. The context and the main aspects of environmental regulation announcements and the relevance assessment task are analyzed. An extensive conceptual data model is developed that serves as a foundation for tailoring a generic method to perform a relevance assessment that considers site-specific individual environmental compliance facts. The method uses heuristic data operations and various text processing techniques from the field of natural language understanding. In order to exemplify the method, two application scenarios are described in which the relevance of new waste management directives are assessed for a multi-site production company.},

Given the actual information present in a set of images, which is the volume spanned by the set in the corresponding latent space, we show how to take into account the user’s preferences in such a volume calculation to build a user-centric metric for the perceived information. Finally, we propose a sampling strategy seeking the minimum set of images that maximize the information perceived by a given user. Experiments using the coco dataset show the ability of the proposed approach to accurately integrate user preference while keeping a reasonable diversity in the sampled image set.},

The increasing complexity of these hardware platforms advocates the use of real-time operating systems and fixed-priority scheduling to manage applications and resources. This trend calls for new methods to synthesize and implement actors in SDF graphs as real-time tasks with computed scheduling parameters (periods, priorities, processor mapping, etc.). This article presents a framework supporting scheduling synthesis, scheduling simulation, and code generation of these graphs. The scheduling synthesis maps each actor to a periodic real-time task and computes the appropriate buffer sizes and scheduling parameters. The results are verified by a scheduling simulator and instantiated by a code generator targeting the RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) operating system. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the framework’s performance and scalability as well as the overhead induced by the code generator.},

Graphs have emerged as data modelling techniques for large-scale applications with heterogeneous, schemaless, and relationship-centric data. Models exist for mapping different types of data to a graph; however, the unification of data from heterogeneous source models into a graph model has not received much attention. To address this, we propose a new framework in this study. The proposed framework first transforms data from various source models into graph models individually and then unifies them into a single graph. To justify the applicability of the proposed framework in e-commerce applications, we analyse and compare query performance, scalability, and database size of the unified graph with heterogeneous source data models for a predefined set of queries. We also access some qualitative measures, such as flexibility, completeness, consistency, and maturity for the proposed unified graph. Based on the experimental results, the unified graph outperforms heterogeneous source models for query performance and scalability; however, it falls behind for database size.},

  abstract     = {In the modern era, the wireless sensor networks play a vital role in scientific and industrial applications. The enduring energy is a crucial metric parameter to be considered in the process of calculating the life span of the wireless sensor networks. Because each sensor node having non-renewable battery supply. In the first generation of wireless sensor applications, data has been transferred from each sensor node to the sink. Further evolution suggests a cluster head approach for transferring data from sensor field to sink. Different strategies of cluster head selection have provided better energy utilization. In the context of effective energy utilization, this work proposes an algorithmic technique called Phase Adjournment Data Capture Technique for a mobile object. In this technique, data will be captured by the mobile object based on its present traveling layer count. When a mobile object goes beyond the receiving limit, it will initiate the sleep mode flag to indicate the master node to stop transferring the data. This technique extends the improvement in energy consumption and also provides effective control of data flooding. It extends and eradicates the need for an erudite antenna essential for setting the direction of the data.},

  abstract     = {Here, we present a quasi-universal correlation for the friction factor in 90-degree and 180-degree bend pipes using the ensemble of metamodels (EOM). Using computational simulations, we obtain frictional losses at curvature ratios from 0.01 to 0.2 and Reynolds numbers up to 0.1 million. With the help of this data, we develop the EOM based correlation. The extensive window of parameters considered in the present study encompasses a vast design and operating conditions of 90-degree and 180-degree bend pipes. The large parametric space considered here essentially represents a variety of hydrodynamic scenarios. We use a sufficient yet nominal set of parameters representative of the variation and perform numerical simulations over the sampled set. Using the simulation data, we then train and validate the EOM to develop the required correlation. The k-fold cross-validation technique is employed to the EOM to optimize the model’s predictive capabilities over the changing flow regimes. We believe that this modeling strategy, along with the database, may act as a base framework towards the further development of data augmentation techniques in pipes of various configurations, in general. Using this EOM based correlation, we further generate a large database for the friction factor in the two smooth bend pipe configurations at various curvature ratio and different Reynolds number. This approach can be viewed as an alternative to the Moody chart, however, for pipe bends.},

  abstract     = {In the business process lifecycle, models can be approached from two perspectives: on the one hand, models are used to create systems in the design phase, and on the other hand, systems in use produce (event) logs that are used to discover the models representing the structure of the systems. These discovered models can be the starting point of a new cycle of analysis, redesign, implementation, etc. Therefore, proper logging of implemented processes in line with system design is a critical element for process discovery. Recently, the consideration of the integration of data and process aspects has seen a surge in interest in both the model-for-design domain as in the automated-model-discovery domain. However, it seems that these domains use different conceptualizations of data/object-aware systems. A definition of how the captured event logs are related to the structure of the global system they are extracted from or are trying to discover is still missing. Especially the concept of an event needs to be aligned, as this is the main concept that the domains have in common. This paper investigates the concepts and terminology used in the different phases of the business process lifecycle: the design phase, the implementation phase (including the implementation of logging) and the discovery phase. The paper contains an extensive running example that is used to illustrate five misalignment issues. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-model that presents a unified terminology for modelling both domains and is demonstrated using the running example. The paper also shows how the concepts of iDOCEM relate to the concepts of a conceptual modelling approach and several event logging formats. iDOCEM is validated with the implementation of a log generator for the running case, demonstrating the feasibility of generating DOCEL-compliant logs from an application.},

As compared to legacy radar technologies, coupled with alarming cyber security issues (the ADS-B protocol provides no encryption nor identification), the reliance on aircraft to communicate this surveillance information exposes air transport to new cyber security threats, and especially to FDIAs—false data injection attacks—where an attacker modifies, blocks, or emits fake ADS-B messages to dupe controllers and surveillance systems. This paper is part of an ongoing research initiative toward the generation of FDIA test scenarios and focuses on supporting the test design activity, i.e., supporting ATC experts to meticulously craft test cases in order to assess the resilience of surveillance systems against FDIAs. To achieve this goal, we propose a complete and powerful domain-specific language (DSL), close to natural language, that provides a large expressiveness to support ATC business experts in creating FDIA’s test scenarios. We demonstrate the design capabilities of this approach and its productivity gain with respect to manually creating the FDIAs test scenarios.},

The ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process is essential in data integration. In the past two decades, modeling the ETL process has become a priority for effectively managing information. This paper aims to explore ETL approaches to help researchers and organizational stakeholders overcome challenges, especially in Big Data integration. It offers a comprehensive overview of ETL methods, from traditional to Big Data, and discusses their advantages, limitations, and the primary trends in Big Data integration. The study emphasizes that many technologies have been integrated into ETL steps for data collection, storage, processing, querying, and analysis without proper modeling. Therefore, more generic and customized design modeling of the ETL steps should be carried out to ensure reusability and flexibility. The paper summarizes the exploration of ETL modeling, focusing on Big Data scalability and processing trends. It also identifies critical dilemmas, such as ensuring compatibility across multiple sources and dealing with large volumes of Big Data. Furthermore, it suggests future directions in Big Data integration by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence processing and storage systems to ensure consistency, efficiency, and data integrity.},

  abstract     = {Radiology reports provide detailed descriptions of medical imaging integrated with patients’ medical histories, while report writing is traditionally labor-intensive, increasing radiologists’ workload and the risk of diagnostic errors. Recent efforts in automating this process seek to mitigate these issues by enhancing accuracy and clinical efficiency. However, existing automated approaches are based on a single timestamp and often neglect the critical temporal aspect of patients’ imaging histories, which is essential for accurate longitudinal analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel H istory E nhanced Radiology R eport Gen eration ( HERGen ) framework that employs a group causal transformer to efficiently integrate longitudinal data across patient visits. Our approach not only allows for comprehensive analysis of varied historical data but also improves the quality of generated reports through an auxiliary contrastive objective that aligns image sequences with their corresponding reports. More importantly, we introduce a curriculum learning-based strategy to adeptly handle the inherent complexity of longitudinal radiology data and thus stabilize the optimization of our framework. The extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing methods in generating accurate radiology reports and effectively predicting disease progression from medical images.},

  abstract     = {The interest in real-time volume graphics has grown rapidly in the last few years, driven by the increasing demands from both academia and industry. GPU-based volume rendering has been used in a wide variety of fields, including scientific visualization, visual effects, and video games. Similarly, real-time volume editing has been used to build terrain and create visual effects during game development; it has even become an integral part of gameplay in various video games (e.g., Minecraft). Nowadays, as the size of volume data increases, processing large volume data in real time is inevitable in many modern application scenarios. However, manipulation and editing of large volume data are associated with various challenges, such as dramatically increasing memory usage and computational burden. In this paper, we present a framework for interactive manipulation and editing of large volume data to address these challenges. A robust and efficient method for large signed distance function (SDF) volume generation is presented and incorporated into the framework. Also, a complete implementation with specialized GPU optimization is introduced to demonstrate its usefulness and effectiveness—it is included in the framework as well. The framework can be an easy-to-use middleware or a plugin that is able to integrate into game engines for the development of various types of applications (e.g., video games). It can also contribute to the research looking at large volume data from a user-centered perspective (e.g., for human–computer interaction researchers).},

  abstract     = {The Hadley Circulation (HC), a fundamental component of global atmospheric circulation, plays an important role in the global energy balance and transport of moisture. The interaction between ENSO and the HC significantly impacts tropical climate and has broad implications for global climate variability through atmospheric teleconnections. The HC is usually represented by the mass stream function. As a result, it can rarely be observed through in-situ measurement. Reanalysis datasets and CMIP models are frequently used to investigate the properties of the HC. Previous studies systematically assess the capability of these CMIP models to represent the spatial distribution and intensity of the HC anomalies associated with ENSO events. However, most of these studies investigate the HC anomaly from a global perspective. In this work, we focus on evaluating the ability of CMIP6 models to capture the three-dimensional features of ENSO-related HC anomalies in comparison to that in six reanalysis datasets. Results show a consistent westward shift of the ENSO-related HC over the tropical Central-Eastern Pacific in almost all CMIP6 models, accompanied by a weakening of the asymmetric component of the ENSO-related HC over the equatorial Pacific. The former is mainly attributed to the westward extension of the Pacific cold tongue in CMIP models, while the latter is more related to the southward shift of the ENSO-related SST and precipitation anomalies in CMIP models. One should be aware of these biases when studying the ENSO-related atmospheric circulation changes. Our study has broad implications for ENSO simulations and the predictability of ENSO-related global climate variabilities.},

Firstly, the single-stand strip dynamic rolling force is predicted by traditional mechanism model and modified model respectively. The modified model has a greater probability of making the prediction error closer to zero, and the prediction root mean squared error of the modified model is lower than that of the mechanism model. Subsequently, targeting the strip dynamic rolling force with strength grade M3A30, the prediction effect of the modified model with strength grades M3A33 is better than that of the modified model with strength grades 1CD61. Finally, to reduce dynamic rolling force fluctuations during tandem rolling process, the rolling schedule is optimized before production. The maximum dynamic rolling force difference of S1, S2, S3, and S4 stands are reduced by 24.372},

  abstract     = {Rock petrophysics experiments and digital core technology have found that permeability is influenced by pore structure such as pore size and morphology, but the two factors usually may not be taken into account together in permeability prediction from seismic data. To better predict permeability, we attempt to derive a permeability model including pore size and morphology parameters on the basis of the Kozeny model. The modified Kozeny model explains that permeability is a function of porosity, aspect ratio, minor semi-axis, and tortuosity. We also employ the random forest regression algorithm, combined with the model derived above, to propose a data-model-driven approach to predict permeability. Specifically, we first calculate the aspect ratio by P-waves velocity and porosity based on the DEM model. Then we fit a random forest regression model to predict the values of minor semi-axis and tortuosity, using aspect ratio, elastic parameters, density, and porosity. Finally, we obtain the predicted permeability values referring to the expression in the modified Kozeny model. Applications on logging and seismic data from the gas field show that the method is reliable and of high precision and the error is controlled within half an order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {In the practical realm of acoustic fault identification in maritime vessels, the predicament stems from the limited availability of actual test fault data and the associated high testing costs, leading to a small sample identification problem. To address this issue, sample expansion emerges as a feasible approach to amplify the identification rate of fault sources in scenarios with limited samples. This study is centered on the utilization of a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), to generate pseudo acoustic data on two-dimensional time-frequency maps, thereby supplementing insufficient fault source samples originating from the actual small test data. The efficacy of proposed data augmentation is confirmed through the application of t-SNE method. Subsequently, a CNN model is trained by mixing the generated fault samples with real samples, and this model is employed to conduct fault identification experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the augmented dataset contributes to an enhanced fault source identification rate and effectively mitigates the adverse influence of limited sample data on the identification outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate model has been widely used in simulation-based engineering design processes to reduce the computational cost, with a focus on cases involving hierarchical low-fidelity (LF) data. However, accurately identifying and sorting the fidelity of LF models is challenging when dealing with non-hierarchical cases. In this paper, we propose a novel non-hierarchical MF surrogate framework called weighted multi-bi-fidelity (WMBF) to solve this problem. The proposed WMBF has both the advantage of two non-hierarchical frameworks, the weighted sum (WS) and parallel combination (PC) techniques, leveraging an entropy-based weight to include multiple-moments statistical information. It offers not only a weight with more information but also a more individualized scaling function within the weighted-sum framework, additionally a more individualized discrepancy function compared with existing methods. Moreover, it provides the idea of exploiting Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence (an entropy-based metric) to characterize uncertainty for calculating weight within the WS framework. To validate the performance of the WMBF, we conduct evaluations using several numerical test functions and one engineering case. The result demonstrates that the WMBF achieves both accurate and robust predictions with minimal computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The modeling and forecasting of short-duration and high-intensity floods are of importance for flood defenses and adaptations. One of the conventional ways to model or forecast such events is to utilize hydrological models driven by meteorological and hydrological station data. However, this suffers from complicated parameter specification and large uncertainties, particularly in regions with very few gauged stations. Based on the daily downscaled Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) solutions, this study employed three different machine learning models and two hydrological models for flood modeling at the daily timescale by taking the Xijiang River Basin in China as a case study. The results show that: (1) the uncertainty of daily GRACE solutions alone governs the difference between GRACE data and hydrological simulations; (2) there is a strong correlation between the high-frequency components of runoff anomalies and terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), and runoff plays a dominant role in TWSA variation during floods; (3) the developed machine learning models can model runoff during floods effectively and outperform the hydrological models. The proposed comprehensive method based on remote sensing satellites provides a potential new way for flood modeling, particularly for poorly gauged regions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate models for incorporating multiple non-hierarchical low-fidelity (LF) datasets, whose rank of fidelity level is unknown, have attracted much attention in engineering problems. However, most of existing approaches either need to build extra surrogate models for LF datasets in the fitting process or ignore the cross-correlations among these LF datasets, resulting in accuracy deterioration of an MF model. To address this, a novel multi-fidelity cokriging model is proposed in this article, termed as MCOK, which can incorporate arbitrary number of non-hierarchical LF datasets without building extra LF surrogate models. A self-contained derivation of MCOK predictor and its mean square error are presented. It puts all the covariances between any two MF datasets into a single matrix and introduces additional parameters “gamma” to account for their cross-correlations. A novel method for tuning these additional parameters in a latent space is developed to deal with the problem associated with non-positive definite correlation matrix. The proposed MCOK method is then validated against a set of numerical test cases and further demonstrated via an engineering example of aerodynamic data fusion for FDL-5A flight vehicle. Results from current test cases show that MCOK outperforms existing non-hierarchical cokriging, linear regression MF surrogate model, and latent-map Gaussian processes model, with more accurate and robust predictions, which makes it more practical for engineering modeling problems.},

By an impulse response identification experiment, the dynamical observations with increasing data length are designed for the purpose of capturing the real-time information of systems and serving for on-line identification. According to the different features of the parameters of the systems to be identified, two separable identification models are constructed through the parameter decomposition and the model decomposition for simplifying the structure of the original identification model. On basis of the separable identification models, a separable Newton recursive parameter estimation approach is developed by means of the Newton search for acquiring highly accurate parameter estimates. In terms of the coupled terms in the separated sub-algorithms, a joint estimation algorithm is presented for removing the coupled terms. The experimental results through the Monte-Carlo tests show that the obtained parameter estimates through the separable algorithm are more accurate than those obtained by the Newton recursive estimation method without the model separation.},

We apply a data mining framework based on digital media and openly accessible government databases to characterize and visually represent crimes such as enforced disappearances along the temporal and spatial dimensions. The data analysis methodology takes a comprehensive approach, segmenting data by age, sex, nationality, geographic location, and period. This segmentation unveils patterns in space and time, thus contributing to a better understanding of the factors influencing missing person phenomena and valuable insights into the dynamics of missing person incidents that have impacted many states and regions in Mexico over the past decade.},

Significant archives of information require automation of the converting process for differentiated databases of SD to updated rules of digitally describing all instances of SD. The main processes of data conversion are considered, based on which the formation technology of acceptable or missed information for spatial data infrastructure is constructed. The paper examines that affine transformation is recommended for cases where geometric distortions of SD are heterogeneous. It has been found that the process of converting spatial and attributive information is more complicated. It is shown that the converting of archival information is realized through a set of functional rules following a set of regulated rules (SRR). It is noted that conversion involves the process of bringing disparate SD in line with the new standards and classifications of SD. The processes of transforming disparate SD between coordinate systems and converting existing data sets relative to old and new classifiers have been formalized. It is established that verification and validation tools allow for detecting disaccord and forming the basis for further data ordering.},

  abstract     = {Parallel processing of large spatial datasets over distributed systems has become a core part of modern data analytic systems like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. The general-purpose design of these systems does not natively account for the data’s spatial attributes and results in poor scalability, accuracy, or prolonged runtimes. Spatial extensions remedy the problem and introduce spatial data recognition and operations. At the core of a spatial extension, a locality-preserving spatial partitioner determines how to spatially group the dataset’s objects into smaller chunks using the distributed system’s available resources. Existing spatial extensions rely on data sampling and often mismanage non-spatial data by either overlooking their memory requirements or excluding them entirely. This work discusses the various challenges that face spatial data partitioning and proposes a novel spatial partitioner for effectively processing spatial queries over large spatial datasets. For evaluation, the proposed partitioner is integrated with the well-known k -Nearest Neighbor ( 
$$k$$
 k NN) spatial join query. Several experiments evaluate the proposal using real-world datasets. Our approach differs from existing proposals by (1) accounting for the dataset’s unique spatial traits without sampling, (2) considering the computational overhead required to handle non-spatial data, (3) minimizing partition shuffles, (4) computing the optimal utilization of the available resources, and (5) achieving accurate results. This contributes to the problem of spatial data partitioning through (1) providing a comprehensive discussion of the problems facing spatial data partitioning and processing, (2) the development of a novel spatial partitioning technique for in-memory distributed processing, (3) an effective, built-in, load-balancing methodology that reduces spatial query skews, and (4) a Spark-based implementation of the proposed work with an accurate 
$$k$$
 k NN spatial join query. Experimental tests show up to 
$$1.48$$
 1.48 times improvement in runtime as well as the accuracy of results.},

The performance of XYJSON was compared with that of the traditional mode. The results show that the performance difference between XYJSON and the traditional mode is small. In addition, a developer survey was conducted on XYJSON for user friendliness and compatibility. All developers rated XYJSON as excellent. The current cloud hybrid storage cannot use a unified control model to realize data control. XYJSON breaks through this bottleneck, making it easier and more efficient to control different types of databases under cloud hybrid storage.},

Contrary to the over-reliance of traditional numerical methods on material constitutive models, the DDS requires only a discrete material dataset of stress–strain pairs to describe the stress–strain relationship. With the multiplicative decomposition of the gradient tensor, the growth effects are introduced. The growth-induced deformation problems are then solved as the pre-strain problems. To overcome the difficulty in determining the growth-induced pre-stress without an explicit constitutive model, a strain-driven searching scheme is thus proposed. Several numerical examples demonstrate the robustness and its good performance of the proposed DDS. In particular, the reason for choosing the strain-driven searching scheme is also illustrated according to the numerical example results.},

Finally, remove educational interference information data, update the position and step size of information elements in college English education data, and optimize the feature mining function of dynamic semantic memory network data using Levy function based on this to achieve highly reliable and robust mining. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can maintain high data feature mining accuracy and robustness under both 5G network overload and attack intensity states; And it effectively improves the recall rate of data feature mining, with high reliability of data feature mining features.},

  abstract     = {The design of optimized non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is critical to the effective control of emergent outbreaks of infectious diseases such as SARS, A/H1N1 and COVID-19 and to ensure that numbers of hospitalized cases do not exceed the carrying capacity of medical resources. To address this issue, we formulated a classic SIR model to include a close contact tracing strategy and structured prevention and control interruptions (SPCIs). The impact of the timing of SPCIs on the maximum number of non-isolated infected individuals and on the duration of an infectious disease outside quarantined areas (i.e. implementing a dynamic zero-case policy) were analyzed numerically and theoretically. These analyses revealed that to minimize the maximum number of non-isolated infected individuals, the optimal time to initiate SPCIs is when they can control the peak value of a second rebound of the epidemic to be equal to the first peak value. More individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention during SPCIs. The longer the duration of the intervention and the stronger the contact tracing intensity during SPCIs, the more effective they are in shortening the duration of an infectious disease outside quarantined areas. The dynamic evolution of the number of isolated and non-isolated individuals, including two peaks and long tail patterns, have been confirmed by various real data sets of multiple-wave COVID-19 epidemics in China. Our results provide important theoretical support for the adjustment of NPI strategies in relation to a given carrying capacity of medical resources.},

  abstract     = {Yuxin Zhu and colleagues propose a stability-constrained operation optimisation for direct current microgrid. The proposed strategy exhibits a data model co-driven framework that ensures that the microgrid meets given stability margins while achieving near-optimal operating costs. Direct current microgrids are widely regarded as a promising clean power system technique. However, the microgrid stability is challenged by routine operations and unplanned faults, especially when the operation optimisation overly pursues economy at the expense of stability. This paper proposes a stability-constrained operation optimisation to balance the stability and economy of islanded direct current microgrids. The proposed stability-constrained operation optimisation is formulated as a nonlinear optimisation model and a model-data co-driven solution algorithm is developed. The proposed method strictly guarantees the stability requirements. Furthermore, the proposed method consists of local convex approximations and a small amount of stability evaluation, thus exhibiting high efficiency. Case study illustrates that the proposed method is not affected by prediction errors and avoids the violation of stability constraints. In some tests, the proposed method keeps the solution time within seconds compared to the model-driven method that may take up to the minute level.},

  abstract     = {Given a steadily increasing demand on multi-material lightweight designs, fast and cost-efficient production technologies, such as the mechanical joining process clinching, are becoming more and more relevant for series production. Since the application of such joining techniques often base on the ability to reach similar or even better joint loading capacities compared to established joining processes (e.g., spot welding), few contributions investigated the systematic improvement of clinch joint characteristics. In this regard, the use of data-driven methods in combination with optimization algorithms showed already high potentials for the analysis of individual joints and the definition of optimal tool configurations. However, the often missing consideration of uncertainties, such as varying material properties, and the related calculation of their impact on clinch joint properties can lead to poor estimation results and thus to a decreased reliability of the entire joint connection. This can cause major challenges, especially for the design and dimensioning of safety-relevant components, such as in car bodies. Motivated by this, the presented contribution introduces a novel method for the robust estimation of clinch joint characteristics including uncertainties of varying and versatile process chains in mechanical joining. Therefore, the utilization of Gaussian process regression models is demonstrated and evaluated regarding the ability to achieve sufficient prediction qualities.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a vision for an integrated and comprehensive Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) framework for Business Intelligence (BI), called BIG - Business Intelligence Generator. It starts from two observations: (i) MDE is a common approach to implement parts of a BI system and (ii) existing MDE approaches to BI are heterogeneous, not always methodologically and technically aligned, and sometimes even overlooking entire layers of the BI systems. This paper objectifies the heterogeneity of existing MDE approaches, extends on the problems it is likely to lead to, and calls for a proper end-to-end MDE-BI approach, with each layer of the MDE-BI architecture capable of proper communication and exchange with the next one. As a response, the BIG framework is introduced, under the form of a vision. The paper describes the BIG framework in general and discusses for each of its modules the benefits of the proposal. Future works required to fulfill the vision are also discussed, suggesting new avenues for research around BI and MDE.},

  abstract     = {In the 21st century, natural language processing (NLP) has obtained much prominence for human–machine interaction (HMI). With this interest in natural language processing (NLP) has grown significantly, numerous NLP tools (e.g., morphology, the tagger, and a parser, etc.) have been developed all over the world. Despite having huge importance and requirements, we have noticed gaps for having a comprehensive single framework or platform, which encompass all NLP-related tools and technologies for promoting the research in NLP and sharing the knowledge and resources among NLP researchers required for understanding and building the solution for HMI. Our objective is to apply Software engineering in natural language processing with the concept of an object-oriented model by using a collection of reusable objects by defining the communication protocol, consisting of a set of rules that must be applied to exchange data between two NLP modules. We proposed state of art ivrE—A virtual environment for creating, modifying, executing, and analyzing various NLP solutions and technology. The proposed idea is broadly based on to define own ivrE-NLP object framework model that permits the developer to create, modify, and execute the application and analyze their outcomes by operations on visual representations of the modules. A variety of NLP-based applications (tools, modules, and plugins) already exist, they can publish into store available with environment so it can be used by research community at large. To develop complete NLP framework or platform, we require much more than just assembling or collecting these tools or modules at one place, no matter how good any tool or module is working individually. It requires not only the standards and a set of protocols, but also requires a compliant composition than a pre-defined algorithms and their implementation. In brief, we require a comprehensive open framework to bundle, manage, and integrate set of NLP tools, modules, components, applications, algorithms, and define their associated rules, comprehensive data structures, and knowledge.},

To meet the requirements, based on the research status of enterprise modeling and intelligent factory modeling method for the optical system, a multi-dimension intelligent factory modeling framework for the complex space optical system was proposed. It contained three dimensions: 1) Business hierarchy dimension based on intelligent manufacturing technology; 2) Development lifecycle dimension based on product digital twin model; 3) Knowledge dimension for crossing disciplinary and domains. This modeling method has features of integration, reusability, multi-level and extendibility. And it was applied on the construction process of the intelligent factory for complex space optical system. Therefore, it is expected to be widely used in intelligent factory construction and implementation on space optical system manufacturing field.},

In response to this, a method for multi-mode transportation network and multi-criterion route optimization is proposed. Initially, A three-objective integer programming model is formulated, and an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm, termed DSNSGA3, is introduced to aid in decision-making. Specifically tailored to the problem’s specifics, a chromosome encoding technique grounded in priority is devised to eliminate infeasible solutions. Subsequently, leveraging non-dominated sorting and crowding distance algorithms to assess the merit of multi-objective solutions, a local search strategy is introduced. This strategy serves dual purposes: it accelerates the algorithm’s convergence rate and effectively minimizes the number of transshipments. Ultimately, an automatic weight-assigning decision-making method based on maximizing deviations is designed, culminating in a definitive decision-making plan. Numerical simulations reveal that the DSNSGA3, as designed in this paper, excels at identifying a diverse and widely distributed Pareto front. Compared to the traditional NSGA3, it demonstrates average improvements of 1.93},

To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid model based on a temporal convolutional network with the feature crossover method and light gradient boosting decision trees (called TCN-LightGBDT). First, we select the initial dataset according to the loading parameters' tolerance range and supply supplementing method for the deviated data. Second, we use the temporal convolutional network to extract the hidden data features in virtual loading areas. Further, a two-dimensional feature matrix is reconstructed through the feature crossover method. Third, we combine these features with basic historical features as the input of the light gradient boosting decision trees to predict the adjustment values of different combinations. Finaly, we compare the proposed model with other related deep learning models, and the experimental results show that our model can accurately predict parameter values.},

The unavoidable springback of hairpin forming has induced critical problems in fabricating the drive motor of electric vehicle that is directly related to the product performance of the motor. In this research, a new method for the springback compensation for hairpin forming was proposed by using artificial intelligence (AI). The AI model calculates the eight springback parameters with respect to the given inputs: material properties, cross-sectional dimension, and die spotting. The training dataset for AI model is based on finite element simulation. Material properties of copper and thin enamel layer were characterized by combined methods: newly designed specimen, nanoindentation, and inverse analysis. For springback compensation, the die spotting value representing the gap between die and punch (or punch stroke) was optimized by using simplex optimization algorithm with the trained AI model. The results showed that the springback could be effectively compensated with the proposed method in a few seconds.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, integrating Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) within service science is increasingly pivotal for enhancing service sector performance. This paper introduces a methodological framework for HCAI service design, called HCAI-SD framework, a novel approach that incorporates HCAI principles into service science to facilitate the design of HCAI services. The framework prioritizes the harmonization of AI capabilities with human-centered design principles and HCAI guidance. While using a design science methodology, the framework effectively addresses the unique requirements of HCAI services by integrating insights from different levels of service science, including the value creation network, service system, and service levels. To demonstrate the application of the framework in a real-world scenario, a comprehensive case study is presented that aims at designing an HCAI service to enhance the systematic literature review process in the domain of AI in education. This research contributes significantly to the integration of AI capabilities within service science and provides a methodological framework for developing robust and complex HCAI services.},

  abstract     = {The way end-users interact with a system plays a crucial role in the high acceptance of software. Related to this, the concept of Intelligent User Interfaces has emerged as a solution to learn from user interactions with the system and adapt interfaces to the user’s characteristics and preferences. However, existing approaches to designing intelligent user interfaces are limited by their user models, which are not capable of representing each and every user characteristic valid for any context. This work aims to address this limitation by presenting a user model that can abstractly represent a wide set of user characteristics in any context of interaction. The model is based on a synthesis of previous works that have proposed specific user models. After the analysis of these works, a more sophisticated user model has been defined, including some required characteristics not existing in previous works. This model has been validated with 62 real end-users who have expressed the users’ characteristics that they consider as relevant to adapt the interaction. The results show that most of these characteristics can be represented by the proposed user model. This user model is the first step towards creating intelligent user interfaces that can adapt interactions to users with similar characteristics and preferences in similar contexts.},

This review investigates the multidimensional role of AI in the pandemic, which arises as a global health crisis, and its role in preparedness and responses, ranging from enhanced epidemiological modelling to the acceleration of vaccine development. The confluence of AI technologies has guided us in a new era of data-driven decision-making, revolutionizing our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and treat infectious illnesses. The review begins by discussing the impact of a pandemic on emerging countries worldwide, elaborating on the critical significance of AI in epidemiological modelling, bringing data-driven decision-making, and enabling forecasting, mitigation and response to the pandemic. In epidemiology, AI-driven epidemiological models like SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) are applied to predict the spread of disease, preventing outbreaks and optimising vaccine distribution. The review also demonstrates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and predictive analytics improve our knowledge of disease propagation patterns. The collaborative aspect of AI in vaccine discovery and clinical trials of various vaccines is emphasised, focusing on constructing AI-powered surveillance networks. Conclusively, the review presents a comprehensive assessment of how AI impacts epidemiological modelling, builds AI-enabled dynamic models by collaborating ML and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, and develops and implements vaccines and clinical trials. The review also focuses on screening, forecasting, contact tracing and monitoring the virus-causing pandemic. It advocates for sustained research, real-world implications, ethical application and strategic integration of AI technologies to strengthen our collective ability to face and alleviate the effects of global health issues.},

Current electrolyzers must be reduced in energy consumption, cost, and maintenance in order to facilitate water electrolysis expansion and, on the other hand, made more durable, efficient, and safe. Due to its harmful environmental effects, fossil fuel use in vehicles is a growing concern. A hybrid electric vehicle is among the most promising technologies currently being developed, as it is high-performing, fuel-efficient, low emission, and has an impressive range. The main aim of this paper is to integrate artificial intelligence and transportation machines and engineer a feasible and non-polluting vehicle that contributes to the making of a sustainable environment. The successful implementation of this project will result in the creation of a better and pollution-free environment that contributes to the conservation of energy and fossil fuels. This paper also discusses a better yet safer way to store hydrogen fuel on a small scale and prevent accidents and save the lives of the users with the help Anti-Accident protocol.},

However, such emissions impacts remain uncertain, owing in part to the diverse mechanisms through which they occur, posing difficulties for measurement and forecasting. Here we introduce a systematic framework for describing the effects of machine learning (ML) on GHG emissions, encompassing three categories: computing-related impacts, immediate impacts of applying ML and system-level impacts. Using this framework, we identify priorities for impact assessment and scenario analysis, and suggest policy levers for better understanding and shaping the effects of ML on climate change mitigation. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping our society in many ways, and climate change is no exception. This Perspective presents a framework to assess how AI affects GHG emissions and proposes approaches to align the technology with climate change mitigation.},

  abstract     = {The specific contents of the new era Fengqiao experience mainly include upholding the party’s mass line, correctly handling contradictions among the people, relying on the masses, and resolving issues locally. These aspects not only reflect the core concepts of grassroots social governance but also represent the inheritance and development of the traditional “Fengqiao experience”. Grass-roots social grid governance is the innovative development of “Maple Bridge Experience” in the new era, and it is also the concrete embodiment of the modernization of grass-roots social governance system and national governance capacity. In recent years, Dongcheng District of Beijing, Zhoushan City of Zhejiang Province, Zhuji City, Changning District of Shanghai and other places have successively implemented grid governance of grass-roots society, making “small grid” play a “big role” in grass-roots governance and service, and really get through the last mile of serving the masses. Subsequently, the grass-roots social grid governance model blossomed all over the country, and digital and information technology was continuously introduced in the follow-up practice, showing a trend of “grid+digitalization+refinement”. The introduction of digital technology has greatly improved the quality and efficiency of grid governance in grassroots society. Generally speaking, it is a bottom-up practice-oriented development to use digital technology in grass-roots social grid governance in various places, which has achieved remarkable results, but it is difficult to form a set of replicable and popularized experiences due to the lack of systematic, legal, standardized, refined and practical thinking. Therefore, on the basis of clarifying the technical problems and rationalizing the operation mechanism, it is necessary to raise the practical experience to a theoretical and normative level, build a model of grass-roots social grid governance mechanism, including multi-collaboration, consultation and judgment, and democratic consultation mechanism, and formulate guiding norms for grass-roots social grid governance. Especially, it explores the dynamic early warning, forecasting, monitoring and legal regulation scheme of grass-roots grid governance driven by the generative big model. Through the generative artificial intelligence technology, we can more accurately and quickly perceive various risks and dynamic changes in the grass-roots social grid. Empowering through technology will help managers find problems early and respond in time, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of governance.},

  abstract     = {Traditional dementia-prevention programs have limited accessibility and lack continuous monitoring, making sustained cognitive and emotional support challenging. This study evaluated the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) care calls on the cognitive function and depression of community-dwelling individuals. Eighty participants with dementia received AI care calls twice weekly from April 23 to November 28, 2024, with 63 calls per participant. The AI care call provided emotional support and cognitive engagement. Cognitive function (attention, memory, and language) and geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores were assessed before and after the intervention. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the pre- and post-intervention scores. General linear models were used to examine the effects of age, sex, and education on changes in clinical measures while controlling for baseline clinical scores. After the AI care call intervention, GDS scores decreased significantly, while memory scores increased significantly. An interaction effect between age and sex was observed in attention and memory score changes, with females showing greater memory improvement and maintenance of attention scores, whereas males experienced a decline in attention scores with no significant change in memory. Additionally, an interaction effect between age and education was observed in the GDS and attention score changes, suggesting that higher education was associated with a protective effect against the worsening of these symptoms following the AI care call intervention. AI care calls may help reduce depression and improve memory function in community-dwelling individuals. The differential effects of sex and education suggest that these factors affect the effectiveness of interventions.},

Conventional geoenergy includes reservoir, production, and drilling, while future-oriented technologies cover geological CO_2 storage (GCS), gas hydrates (GH), and underground hydrogen storage (UHS). The 254 papers were analyzed systematically based on authorship, publication year, key findings, input-output data relationships, applied AI methods, and sample sizes for AI training. Results highlight the extensive use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for tasks such as proxy modeling, dimensionality reduction, data generation, and optimization. Proxy modeling was the most commonly applied method, effectively predicting key economic and engineering parameters. Future-oriented applications require integrating multiple factors for safety and efficiency, emphasizing the need for advanced AI techniques and larger datasets. Conventional studies used larger datasets (average 49,794 samples) compared to future-oriented applications (average 13,779 samples), reflecting their longer research history. The average input-output data sizes (log scale) for ML and DL were 2.01 and 0.34 vs. 4.12 and 2.00, respectively, showing DL’s versatility in handling larger datasets. As geoenergy systems grow more complex, advanced AI methods must address interconnected geo-scales from pore to field levels. Future research should focus on developing automated, user-independent AI systems to enhance model selection and broaden AI applications across diverse datasets, driving greater efficiency and innovation in the geoenergy sector.

The development of the ACOS program was based on two sequential steps. The first step was to design a conceptual framework and analyse the related timetabling processes and activities. The second step was to develop the proposed graphic user interface tool that embedded computational intelligence algorithm. The performance of the ACOS program were tested using real-world problems. The statistical analysis on the experimental results suggested that the ACOS tool produced feasible timetables on all problem sizes. The proposed tool also generated the best timetables with the lowest travelling cost as well as convergence speed for all cases.

To reduce the difference between the generated image and actual image, an edge GAN (eGAN) model using edge detection was proposed. This eGAN model can utilize ambient intelligence, a human-centered technology that includes IoT, smart cities, and autonomous driving. Ambient intelligence is essential for the interconnection between humans and objects. The eGAN model was used to make this connectivity more accurate and reliable. Edge detection is an edge feature that extracts the boundaries of an image and generate images in a fast manner; however, because its threshold is arbitrarily set, the connectivity may be unstable. To solve this problem and improve the performance of the eGAN model, we analyzed various GAN models and edge detection methods and proposed a new edge detection technology using threshold settings. This edge detection method sets the threshold value for images, thereby increasing the accuracy of edge connection and reducing the loss error between the image generated by the eGAN model and actual image. To evaluate the performance of the eGAN model, the error between the generated image and actual image was compared by applying the GAN and eGAN models to the same image dataset. Consequently, it was found that the performance of the eGAN model improved by 21},

Therefore, it is crucial to ask which features of minds have we replicated, which are missing, and if that matters. One core feature that humans bring to tasks, when dealing with the ambiguity, emergent knowledge, and social context presented by the world, is reflection. Yet this capability is completely missing from current mainstream AI. In this paper we ask what reflective AI might look like. Then, drawing on notions of reflection in complex systems, cognitive science, and agents, we sketch an architecture for reflective AI agents, and highlight ways forward.},

This study aims to systematically map the research area, identify knowledge gaps, and examine potential research areas for researchers and practitioners. The investigation focuses on three primary research questions: the main research themes concerning ESG and AI in finance, the evolution of research intensity and interest in these areas, and the application and evolution of AI techniques specifically in research studies within the ESG and AI in finance domain. Eight archetypical research domains were identified: (i) Trading and Investment, (ii) ESG Disclosure, Measurement and Governance, (iii) Firm Governance, (iv) Financial Markets and Instruments, (v) Risk Management, (vi) Forecasting and Valuation, (vii) Data, and (viii) Responsible Use of AI. Distinctive AI techniques were found to be employed across these archetypes. The study contributes to consolidating knowledge on the intersection of ESG, AI, and finance, offering an ontological inquiry and key takeaways for practitioners and researchers. Important insights include the popularity and crowding of the Trading and Investment domain, the growth potential of the Data archetype, and the high potential of Responsible Use of AI, despite its low publication count. By understanding the nuances of different research archetypes, researchers and practitioners can better navigate this complex landscape and contribute to a more sustainable and responsible financial sector.},

  abstract     = {Characterized by high malignancy and limited treatment efficacy, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a clinically challenging subtype within breast cancer classifications, marked by rapid progression and high mortality. Abnormal activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway signaling, a pathway integral to tumor progression, metastasis, angiogenesis and immune evasion, is a common feature in a broad spectrum of malignancies. Owing to the restricted effectiveness of first-line interventions including surgical resection, cytotoxic agents, and radiation therapy for TNBC, novel agents that modulate TGFβ activity represent a compelling therapeutic avenue. Herein, we reported the identification and preclinical evaluation of YH395A, a novel tetrahydro‐β‐carboline derivative derived from the lead compound YR‐290 with virtual screening from pseudo molecular library generated by generative deep learning method. In vitro studies demonstrated that YH395A dose‐dependently inhibited TNBC cell migration and invasion. In vivo, administration of YH395A not only curtailed metastatic dissemination and prevented the extravasation of breast cancer cells into lung parenchyma in mouse models but also significantly reduced tumor growth in a patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) model. Mechanistic analyses indicated that these antitumor effects are mediated via potent inhibition of TGFβ signaling. These cumulative results demonstrate YH395A’s viability as a novel therapeutic agent for TNBC, while emphasizing the necessity for expanded preclinical validation studies.},

  abstract     = {As the application of intelligent unmanned systems in open environments becomes increasingly widespread, temporal consistency in the system’s dynamic evolution process has become a critical issue for determining whether the system is safe and reliable. To address this issue, this paper proposes a model checking-based method for verifying the temporal consistency of software evolution in intelligent unmanned systems, accurately modeling and verifying the temporal behavior of individual agents and multi-agent evolution in the system. First, a temporal consistency constraint verification framework for the evolution of intelligent unmanned systems is presented, under which a global time automaton network model is constructed. The framework defines global and local clock variables, enabling a unified representation of both the overall system process and the time properties of individual agents. Secondly, the temporal consistency constraint patterns under the three evolution operations—addition, deletion, and replacement—are described. Based on this, a temporal consistency verification algorithm is designed, covering dynamic operations such as the addition, deletion, and replacement of agents. The algorithm performs temporal consistency checks for each state through a marking function and depth-first search, ensuring the system’s temporal consistency. Finally, a case study on verifying the temporal consistency of an intelligent autonomous vehicle system is presented. Through a series of operations such as the addition, deletion, and replacement of agents, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are verified. The results show that the method can effectively detect temporal inconsistencies in the evolution process, improving the reliability of system evolution in open environments.},

In the realm of structural engineering, experimentation is a herculean endeavour; hence, AI-based algorithms are feasible options for predicting different engineering design parameters such as structural reaction and compressive strength. The purpose of this study is to review the many artificial intelligence applications in structural engineering that have arisen in recent years. The importance of AI in the structural engineering sector is examined after a brief introduction to AI is given.

  abstract     = {To obtain the maximum field oil recovery ( FOR ) and CO_2 sequestration ratio ( CSR ), it is imperative to optimize the CO_2 injection and liquid production rate. However, previous studies ignore the geomechanical risks indeed. Therefore, a hybrid optimization framework was designed that combines artificial intelligence methods (Support Vector Regression with the Gaussian kernel, Gaussian-SVR or Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) and multi-objective optimization algorithms (multiple objective particle swarm optimization, MOPSO or Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, NSGA-II) to find the optimal CO_2 injection and production strategies under different water cut. With this framework, the largest oil recovery and CO_2 storage under the lowest fault slip displacement ( FSD ) can be obtained simultaneously. In this framework, Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to produce the samples for training and testing for cases with water cut 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 0.95, and the corresponding results are obtained from numerical simulations. Thus, Gaussian-SVR and LSTM are trained as the proxy model to substitute the numerical simulator. Thus, the MOPSO and NSGA-II are utilized to determine the Pareto Front of the optimum result and work schedules. A synthetic case reservoir model with high-water cut and one fault is employed to test the robustness of this framework. The results show that compared with FOR and CSR , due to the serious nonlinearity, the training and prediction of FSD with the proxy model are not very good. The prediction errors increase with the water cut, and when the field water cut is larger than 0.9, the practical requirements (± 20},

  abstract     = {Embodied intelligence is one of the main motivations for soft robotics. Body compliance enables embodied intelligence and helps to simplify the control of robots for achieving the required tasks in complex environments. A full mathematical description of the deformations of a soft robot, given by its internal interactions with actuators and by the external interactions with the surrounding environment, can be the tool for mastering body compliance and embodied intelligence. Relevant modelling and computational techniques are within grasp, in an interdisciplinary effort. Soft robotics can transition to a model-informed discipline, with embodied-intelligence-based design and control, that can pave the way towards soft-robot digital twins. Embodied intelligence (intelligence that requires and leverages a physical body) is a well-known paradigm in soft robotics, but its mathematical description and consequent computational modelling remain elusive, with a need for models that can be used for design and control purposes. We argue that filling this gap will enable full uptake of embodied intelligence in soft robots. We provide a concise guide to the main mathematical modelling approaches, and consequent computational modelling strategies, that can be used to describe soft robots and their physical interactions with the surrounding environment, including fluid and solid media. We aim to convey the challenges and opportunities within the context of modelling the physical interactions underpinning embodied intelligence. We emphasize that interdisciplinary work is required, especially in the context of fully coupled robot–environment interaction modelling. Promoting this dialogue across disciplines is a necessary step to further advance the field of soft robotics. Modelling soft-robot deformations induced by actuators and interactions with the surrounding environment can enable full uptake of embodied intelligence. This Technical Review provides a concise guide to modelling approaches and computational strategies that can lead to model-informed design of embodied intelligent robots.},

  abstract     = {The scenario-based verification and validation of highly automated driving functions requires extensive testing using a mix of interconnected test methods with varying degrees of virtualization, ranging from faster-than-real-time scenario exploration in software-in-the-loop simulations to in-vehicle testing. The efficiency of scenario-based test procedures is continuously improving, especially in the simulation domain with the introduction of parallel execution in the cloud, parameter variation algorithms and established standards for driving scenario specification. In contrast, current test case specifications are very tool- and project-specific and often not machine-readable, hindering the exchange, reuse and automation of scenario-based tests across all test platforms. This paper presents a novel machine-readable test specification format for scenario-based testing implemented as an XML schema. Its data structure incorporates logical or concrete scenarios within preconditions, inputs and pass criteria for automated driving functions following established test standards such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119. The format enables a tool-agnostic specification, reuse and exchange of scenario-based tests for simulation-based and in-vehicle testing. A cloud-simulation workflow has been developed that exploits the automation potential offered by the format. By means of testing a highway ramp-on function, a logical test case is generated and automatically imported into the simulator. For efficiently exploring the parameter space of the logical test case, a novel parameter variation method is applied. The combination of a dedicated test case format, intelligent scenario exploration methods and a state-of-the-art cloud simulation platform results in a highly efficient scenario-based test procedure.},

This is a common societal issue due to various dietary needs arising from medical conditions, allergies, or nutritional preferences. AdaptaFood provides recipe adaptations from two inputs: a recipe image (a fine-tuned image-captioning model allows us to extract the ingredients) or a recipe object (we extract the ingredients from the recipe features). For the adaptation, we propose to use an attention-based language sentence model based on BERT to learn the semantics of the ingredients and, therefore, discover the hidden relations among them. Specifically, we use them to perform two tasks: (1) align the food items from several sources to expand recipe information; (2) use the semantic features embedded in the representation vector to detect potential food substitutes for the ingredients. The results show that the model successfully learns domain-specific knowledge after re-training it to the food computing domain. Combining this acquired knowledge with the adopted strategy for sentence representation and food replacement enables the generation of high-quality recipe versions and dealing with the heterogeneity of different-origin food data.},

  abstract     = {This study intends to scrutinize the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Product-Service Innovation (PSI). The literature on AI enabled PSI, other related innovation business models, product-service systems, and servitization has grown significantly since 2018; therefore, there is a need to structure the literature in a systematic manner and add to what has been studied thus far. Product-service innovation is used to represent the relevance of achieving innovation in business models dealing with innovation outcomes including artificial intelligence. This study used bibliographic coupling to analyze 159 articles emerging from the fields of computer sciences, engineering, social sciences, decision sciences, and management. This review depicts structures of the literature comprising five (5) clusters, namely, (1) technology adoption and transformational barriers, which depicts the barriers faced during the adoption of AI-enabled technologies and following transformation; (2) data-driven capabilities and innovation, which highlights the data-based capabilities supported through AI and innovation; (3) digitally enabled business model innovation, which explained how AI-enabled business model innovation occurs; (4) smart design changes and sustainability, which reveals the working of AI in product service environments with different design changes and transformations based on sustainability; and (5) sectorial application, which highlights industry examples. Each cluster is comprehensively analyzed based on its contents, including central themes, models, theories, and methodologies, which help to identify the gaps and support suggestions for future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and wireless networks have fueled the growth of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications at the edge, addressing challenges such as power consumption, bandwidth constraints, and response latency. Our previous studies enhanced the management of edge AIoT applications, particularly for smart cameras. However, developing these systems remains challenging due to the lack of a unified platform, resulting in high complexity, inconsistency, and increased costs driven by limited code reuse and fragmented development processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an edge-computing-based intelligent service framework for smart camera applications. The framework provides a unified platform that enhances consistency, facilitates code reuse, and reduces costs and deployment time. It employs a microservices architecture deployed on a virtualization platform with container orchestration at the edge, allowing customization to meet specific application needs. The system also supports extended services, including cluster management, system monitoring, and DevOps practices for secure continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This approach improves flexibility and efficiency in the development, deployment, management, and monitoring of smart camera applications at the edge. Experimental use cases, including face mask recognition and helmet detection applications, validate the proposed system’s effectiveness.},

GPS-based route choice model is substantial for handling the transportation complications of a big city, traffic engineering, and remote communication among vehicles. With this scenario in mind, we recommend a strategy to manage and evaluate the performance of the vehicular cloud. Different types of cloud services, storage mechanisms, resources, and information management are provided to the cloud users, commercial vehicles, emergency services, and disaster services through the vehicular cloud computing model. The performance of the vehicular cloud can be raised to meet the information requirements of the cloud users by using the proposed route choice model. The primary objective of the proposed model is to provide the finest traffic light control method using GPS inputs and vehicular area networks.

  abstract     = {Purpose This article introduces an intelligent network for monitoring breast cancer patients. The increase in the network's speed for monitoring the patient depends on the extracted information from the nodes, information rate, network topology, type of data, and the analysis method used for processing this information. The extracted information from the network determines the patient monitoring rate, and the network infrastructure is designed in a way that reports the patient's information in real-time, moment by moment. The decision-making model is based on the OODA cycle, which includes the stages of "Observe," where information is extracted from the network, "Orient," "Decide," and "Act." The stages of "Analyze," "Decide," and "Act" are based on the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model. Methods In this paper, three algorithms, namely, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), have been used to evaluate the "Analysis" and "Decision" stages. These three algorithms are compared with each other using the criteria of Accuracy, Specificity, and Sensitivity. Furthermore, the intelligent network is evaluated based on its network topology, data, and decision-making speed. Results The simulation results demonstrate that the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method exhibits a significantly higher level of accuracy compared to the other methods. The simulation results indicate that the accuracy and speed of the intelligent network monitoring have improved by approximately 9.8 compared to other non-intelligent networks (OODA loop). Conclusions In this article, an intelligent network is proposed for monitoring breast cancer patients. The intelligent network has an OODA loop for monitoring and controlling the patient. The OODA loop includes observation, analysis, decision, and action, making it a continuous and ever-changing process. In order to expand the OODA loop for better control and monitoring of the patient, we have extended the "observation" and "orientation" phases of the process.The observation method is determined based on the type of data and the network structure. Another method is the directionality, which is determined based on the hierarchical fuzzy analysis. Indeed, the intelligence of the network aims to adjust the decision-making criteria analysis in a way that maximizes the speed of diagnosing the patient with minimal time.},

  abstract     = {The Transformer network has powerful parallelization and global information capturing capabilities by utilizing the self-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture long-term dependencies between sequence elements. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, Transformer models global contextual information without recursive or convolutional operations, and exhibits greater adaptability when dealing with non-stationary signals. In the field of fault diagnosis, this architecture is particularly good at capturing fault features in vibration signals across time scales, providing a new solution for fault pattern recognition under complex operating conditions. However, the performance is easily affected under small sample conditions or in the presence of strong non-stationary noise. The data samples collected in engineering practice often come from different working conditions and contain complex noise, which further increases the challenge of model training. Diagnostic methods based on one-dimensional vibration data are difficult to intuitively mine the local features of fault signals, which limits the ability of deep-level feature extraction. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Wavelet-Driven Transformer network-based Dual-scale intelligent feature screening Fault Detector (WDT-DFFD). Firstly, an adaptive time-frequency analysis layer is built using continuous wavelet convolutional layers, and the scaling and translation parameters are learned directly from the original data to convert the time-domain signal into time-frequency domain images, which enhances the feature extraction and signal denoising capabilities. Secondly, the Transformer in Transformer (TNT) network is utilized to build a Dual-scale Fault Detector, and the Bayesian variational attention mechanism is introduced as an intelligent feature filter, which enhances the network's ability to capture image details and fault information. Finally, experiments on the bearing vibration dataset and gearbox vibration dataset show that the method maintains high diagnostic accuracy and robustness under small samples and strong noise conditions.},

  abstract     = {A transformation engine carries out the execution of the model transformation specification to generate the target model from its source model. This transformation represents a complex aspect of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and involves concepts specific to the technology. Nevertheless, the literature and practice on this topic define CASE tools that are used by designers as semi-automatic or automatic solutions. The use of CASE tools in software engineering poses a risk due to their automatic or semi-automatic recommendations for model creation, without direct designer oversight. This can lead to suboptimal or irrelevant models that do not align with project requirements. Designers must be aware of these limitations and supplement tool usage with their expertise to ensure the quality of generated models. In this context, designers are responsible for many tasks in the model transformation process, including selecting/dropping objects (e.g., attributes, relations), setting the number of configuration parameters, splitting, merging a structure, and disseminating the results. In order to fully model the transformation process, we must replace designers with a method that emulates the same expertise of designers and human intelligence during shared design, while leveraging collective intelligence. To do so, we propose using an Evolutionary Multi-Agent System (EMAS) called MeTeo-EMAS to emulate human actions in the transformation model that best self-optimizes/self-configures during model transformation, harnessing collective intelligence. We describe the components of our approach and show how MeTeo-EMAS agents use their goal model to reason about goals during their model transformation process. Finally, usage examples of MeTeo-EMAS are provided to highlight its importance in harnessing collective intelligence for effective model transformation.},

  abstract     = {Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are utilized to find hostile network connections. This can be accomplished by looking at traffic network activity, but it takes a lot of work. The NIDS heavily utilizes approaches for data extraction and machine learning to find anomalies. In terms of feature selection, NIDS is far more effective. This is accurate since anomaly identification uses a number of time-consuming features. Because of this, the feature selection method influences how long it takes to analyze movement patterns and how clear it is. The goal of the study is to provide NIDS with an attribute selection approach. PSO has been used for that purpose. The Network Intrusion Detection System that is being developed will be able to identify any malicious activity in the network or any unusual behavior in the network, allowing the identification of the illegal activities and safeguarding the enormous amounts of confidential data belonging to the customers from being compromised. In the research, datasets were produced utilising both a network infrastructure and a simulation network. Wireshark is used to gather data packets whereas Cisco Packet Tracer is used to build a network in a simulated environment. Additionally, a physical network consisting of six node MCUs connected to a laptop and a mobile hotspot, has been built and communication packets are being recorded using the Wireshark tool. To train several machine learning models, all the datasets that were gathered—created datasets from our own studies as well as some common datasets like NSDL and UNSW acquired from Kaggle—were employed. Additionally, PSO, which is an optimization method, has been used with these ML algorithms for feature selection. In the research, KNN, decision trees, and ANN have all been combined with PSO for a specific case study. And it was found demonstrated the classification methods PSO + ANN outperformed PSO + KNN and PSO + DT in this case study.},

As a matter of fact, it appears that most of them are quite diverse and useful, also when applied in the field of manufacturing processes. However, the interactions between the agents involved in relevant manufacturing applications often is not straightforward, as the environment can be quite harsh and dynamic. Herein, a mapping is sketched between AI territories and manufacturing process-related operations. To this end, different aspects of the processes are considered, such as monitoring, modelling, optimization, design and preparation, as well as control, twinning and operation. For each one of these cases, AI technologies and workflows are matched, leading to a roadmap for future research. In this path, there are various specific challenges, many of which are mentioned here, as well. Specific examples from both conventional and non-conventional processes are considered, as well as focused illustrations of the possibilities that AI technologies can offer. In addition, the different manufacturing attributes, as guided by different strategies, are discussed in the context of the aforementioned concept. These include, among others, sustainability, human centricity and quality management. Finally, the role of services is discussed under the current context.},

This Review focuses on AI-enabled advances in polymer informatics, highlighting practical design protocols and exemplar applications in energy and sustainability, while also addressing challenges to industrial adoption. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods continue to make inroads into accelerated materials design and development. Here, we review AI-enabled advances made in the subfield of polymer informatics, with a particular focus on the design of application-specific practical polymeric materials. We consider exemplar design attempts within a few critical and emerging application spaces, including materials designs for storing, producing and conserving energy, and those that can prepare us for a sustainable economy powered by recyclable and/or biodegradable polymers. AI-powered workflows help to efficiently search the staggeringly large chemical and configurational space of materials, using modern machine-learning (ML) algorithms to solve ‘forward’ and ‘inverse’ materials design problems. A theme explored throughout this Review is a practical informatics-based design protocol that involves creating a set of application-specific target property criteria, building ML model predictors for those relevant target properties, enumerating or generating a tangible population of viable polymers, and selecting candidates that meet design recommendations. The protocol is demonstrated for several energy- and sustainability-related applications. Finally, we offer our outlook on the lingering obstacles that must be overcome to achieve widespread adoption of informatics-driven protocols in industrial-scale materials development.},

However, managing the energy feature constraints is the main concern for maintaining optimal WSN performance. The clustering methods with other energy optimal protocols were implemented in the past, but the problems still do not end because of the movable environment. So, the current article has defined a novel Chimp-based Clustering Vanilla Recurrent Sleep Awake (CbCVRSA) system for the WSN application for upgrading wireless communication services. The work-free nodes have been set to a Sleep state to optimize energy utilization. The status of the present nodes in the WSN framework is forecasted through the Chimp best solution, and the best CH is selected for efficient data transmission. Finally, the reliability of the novel CbCVRSA is measured through the chief communication metrics like data broadcasting score, throughput, and packet falling rate. In addition, the comparative assessment has revealed the improvement and the need for a novel solution for this particular application.},

The importance of integrating insights from brain-based structural knowledge into AI systems cannot be overestimated. In this survey, we review research on structural knowledge in the brain, focusing on cognitive maps and schemas. We then examine computational models, highlighting potential mechanisms that serve as a bridge to AI. Finally, we provide an overview of AI models that leverage both brain-inspired and traditional structural knowledge and discuss how biological mechanisms can be applied to enhance AI systems.

  abstract     = {While AI is extensively transforming Software Engineering (SE) fields, SE is still in need of a framework to consider overall all phases to facilitate Automated Software Evolution (ASEv), particularly for intelligent applications that are context-rich instead of conquering each division independently. Its complexity comes from the intricacy of the intelligent applications, the heterogeneity of the data sources, and the constant changes in the context. This study proposes a conceptual framework for achieving automated software evolution, emphasizing the importance of multimodality learning. A Selective Sequential Scope Model (3 S) model is developed based on the conceptual framework, and it can be used to categorize existing and future research when it covers different SE phases and multimodal learning tasks. This research is a preliminary step toward the blueprint of a higher-level ASEv. The proposed conceptual framework can act as a practical guideline for practitioners to prepare themselves for diving into this area. Although the study is about intelligent applications, the framework and analysis methods may be adapted for other types of software as AI brings more intelligence into their life cycles.},

This highlights the significance of modeling approaches in predicting the behavior of different alloys produced using AM. In this regard, recent promising accomplishments of machine learning (ML) methods in a wide variety of tasks exemplified by computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) have rendered these tools as an alternative for conventional modeling frameworks already used in AM. This work proposes an intelligent algorithm for predicting the melt pool geometry of 316L stainless steels fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). To fulfill this goal, a benchmark dataset is introduced, which is experiment-oriented and alloy-specific. This dataset contains the state-of-the-art melt pool geometry reported in the literature as well as some experimental results conducted for this study. The proposed algorithm was validated on this dataset and its performance was compared with the ML frameworks deployed recently in AM. Results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methodology. This approach enhances the repeatability and consistency of LPBF and facilitates process parameter optimization to develop desired properties.},

  abstract     = {Drug development is a complex and time-consuming endeavor that traditionally relies on the experience of drug developers and trial-and-error experimentation. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly emerging large language models and generative AI, is poised to redefine this paradigm. The integration of AI-driven methodologies into the drug development pipeline has already heralded subtle yet meaningful enhancements in both the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. Here we present an overview of recent advancements in AI applications across the entire drug development workflow, encompassing the identification of disease targets, drug discovery, preclinical and clinical studies, and post-market surveillance. Lastly, we critically examine the prevailing challenges to highlight promising future research directions in AI-augmented drug development. This Review explores the state-of-the-art applications of artificial intelligence in small-molecule drug development, from target identification and drug synthesis up to clinical trial design and conduct.},

We combine an epidemiological model of disease transmission with quasi-random variation arising from the timing of stay-at-home-orders to estimate the causal roles of policy interventions and voluntary social distancing. We then relate the residual variation in disease transmission rates to observable features of cities. We estimate significant impacts of policy and social distancing responses, but we show that the magnitude of policy effects was modest, and most social distancing was driven by voluntary responses. Moreover, we show that neither policy nor rates of voluntary social distancing explained a meaningful share of geographic variation. The most important predictors of which cities were hardest hit by the pandemic were exogenous characteristics such as population and density.},

The sustainable development of China has been challenged by the misalignment of water demand and supply across regions under varying climate change scenarios. Here we develop a water stress prediction index using a fuzzy decision-making approach, which analyzes spatiotemporal variations of water stress and concomitant effects on the populace within China. Our results indicate that water stress will increase from 2020 to 2099 under both low and high emission scenarios, primarily due to decreased water supplies like surface runoff and snow water content. Seasonal analysis reveals that annual fluctuations in water stress are mainly driven by changes in spring and autumn. Water stress is projected to be considerably lower in southeastern provinces compared to northwestern ones, where, on average, over 20},

By integrating the needs of planning and design courses, five teaching modules, including GIS data collection, spatial analysis and urban simulation, were constructed, and real planning cases were innovatively used to create practice scenes and establish an interactive connection mechanism for the course group. In the implementation of the reform, project-based teaching is emphasized, and a multiple evaluation system is constructed. The practice shows that the mode effectively improves the students’ spatial analysis ability and software application level, promotes the deep integration of GIS technology and planning and design practice, and provides a feasible path for cultivating application-oriented planning talents.},

We reviewed and refined a published CLIMEX model for C. capitata , taking into consideration new records in marginal locations, with a particular focus on Europe. To assess the model fit and to aid in interpreting the meaning of the new European distribution records, we used a time series climate dataset to explore the temporal patterns of climate suitability for C. capitata from 1970 to 2019. At selected bellwether sites in Europe, we found statistically significant trends in increasing climate suitability, as well as a substantial northward expansion in the modelled potential range. In California, we also found a significant trend of northward and altitudinal expansion of areas suitable for C. capitata establishment. These results provide further evidence of climate change impacts on species distributions and the need for innovative responses to increased invasion threats.},

However, the dearth of robust and precise toolkits for genomic manipulation and tight regulation has hindered any substantial advance. Herein we describe the construction of a robust genetic toolkit for M. pneumoniae , and its successful deployment to engineer synthetic gene switches that control and limit Mycoplasma growth, for biosafety containment applications.

Oxytetracycline (OTC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) contamination have caused serious risks to human health, and modified biochar is considered as a potential adsorbent for their removal. The typical agricultural waste of cotton husk was used as the feedstock, then was combined with γ-Fe_2O_3 and ball milling to innovatively synthesize nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) supporting magnetic cotton hush-derived biochar (Fe_2O_3@BMBC) by reductive calcination. Fe_2O_3@BMBC performed excellent adsorption performance with a maximum adsorption capacity for OTC (266.7 mg · g^−1) and CIP (83.36 mg · g^−1), and its adsorption capacity was 1.6 and 2.3 times that of cotton husk biochar (BC). Characterization analysis showed that Fe_2O_3@BMBC contained abundant oxygenated functional groups (e.g., -OH, C = O and Fe–O) and its surface was covered by diverse iron oxides. The high magnetization sensitivity of Fe_2O_3@BMBC guaranteed that it was easily to be separated by a magnet. Oxygenated functional groups (e.g., -OH, C = O and Fe–O) participated in the adsorption process, and solution pH significantly affected the adsorption behaviour, and pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich model better fitting the kinetics and isotherms data. These results confirmed that π-π conjugation, H-bonding, Fe–O complexation and electrostatic interactions contributed to the greater adsorption capacity of Fe_2O_3@BMBC. Ethanol + ultrasound could efficiently regenerate the used Fe_2O_3@BMBC and maintain its sustainable adsorption performance for OTC and CIP. Additionally, Fe_2O_3@BMBC performed a good environmental security in a wide pH range (from 3 to 11) in view of the low leaching risk of Fe. Graphical Abstract},

The scientific challenge is not only to extract such context data, but also to store this data for further query and discovery approaches. Classical approaches use RDF triple stores, which have serious limitations. Here, we propose a multiple step knowledge graph approach using labeled property graphs based on polyglot persistence systems to utilize context data for context mining, graph queries, knowledge discovery and extraction. We introduce the graph-theoretic foundation for a general context concept within semantic networks and show a proof of concept based on biomedical literature and text mining. Our test system contains a knowledge graph derived from the entirety of PubMed and SCAIView data and is enriched with text mining data and domain-specific language data using Biological Expression Language. Here, context is a more general concept than annotations. This dense graph has more than 71M nodes and 850M relationships. We discuss the impact of this novel approach with 27 real-world use cases represented by graph queries. Storing and querying a giant knowledge graph as a labeled property graph is still a technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate how our data model is able to support the understanding and interpretation of biomedical data. We present several real-world use cases that utilize our massive, generated knowledge graph derived from PubMed data and enriched with additional contextual data. Finally, we show a working example in context of biologically relevant information using SCAIView.},

The dermal scales of sharks, which can change from an aligned state to a tilted state, account for flow control in the attached and separated flow. However, the mechanism of using tilted biomimetic shark scales for flow separation control is still not clear. In the present work, the effects of biomimetic shark scales with fixed tilt angles on flow separation over an inclined plate are investigated experimentally using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The Reynolds number based on the streamwise length of the plate and the freestream velocity is 2.0 × 10^4. From the perspective of the time-averaged flow field, it is found that the tilted biomimetic shark scales decrease the reattachment length by 57},

Four structures were designed and evaluated numerically using a three-point bending test by means of the finite element method. All structures were constructed with aluminum 6063-T6. The accuracy of the results was ensured by an initial experimental validation. Additionally, a more realistic simulation was achieved by considering Johnson-Cook failure models. According to the results, all bioinspired thin-walled structures (BTWS) exhibited better crashworthiness performance compared to typical circular tubes. However, the best performance was achieved by the tube BC-04, with a crush force efficiency of 0.837. Finally, from our findings, a novel design of side-door beam for automotive safety is proposed.},

This study investigates the knee mechanics of ACLR plus various anterolateral augmentations using a patient-specific musculoskeletal knee model. Materials and methods A patient-specific knee model was developed in OpenSim using contact surfaces and ligament details derived from MRI and CT data. The contact geometry and ligament parameters were varied until the predicted knee angles for intact and ACL-sectioned models were validated against cadaveric test data for that same specimen. Musculoskeletal models of the ACLR combined with various anterolateral augmentations were then simulated. Knee angles were compared between these reconstruction models to determine which technique best matched the intact kinematics. Also, ligament strains calculated by the validated knee model were compared to those of the OpenSim model driven by experimental data . The accuracy of the results was assessed by calculating the normalised RMS error (NRMSE); an NRMSE < 30},

We collected soil samples surrounding a hospital effluent and measured the resistance of bacterial isolates against multiple antibiotics and heavy metals. One strain BMCSI 3 was found to be sensitive to all tested antibiotics. However, it was resistant to many heavy metals and metalloids like cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, arsenic, and others. This strain was motile and potentially spore-forming. Whole-genome shotgun assembly of BMCSI 3 produced 4.95 Mb genome with 4,638 protein-coding genes. The taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis revealed it, to be a Bordetella petrii strain. Multiple genomic islands carrying mobile genetic elements; coding for heavy metal resistant genes, response regulators or transcription factors, transporters, and multi-drug efflux pumps were identified from the genome. A comparative genomic analysis of BMCSI 3 with annotated genomes of other free-living B. petrii revealed the presence of multiple transposable elements and several genes involved in stress response and metabolism. This study provides insights into how genomic reorganization and plasticity results in evolution of heavy metals resistance by acquiring genes from its natural environment.},

  abstract     = {Nunavik Inuit communities seek a sustainable production system of their built environment that would respond to their human, technological, technical, economic, and ecological needs according to their aspirations. Hence, Biomimicry, which aims at innovation and Sustainability by emulating nature’s proven models and strategies, seems promising since it introduces a philosophy of the relationship between humans and nature that evokes the Inuit one. However, like other approaches, Biomimicry needs work on implementing Sustainability, particularly in architecture, which leads to seeking reasons for those malfunctions and potential remedies. A literature review was conducted to circumscribe the notion of Sustainability to better understand its relationship to Biomimicry and investigate its significance and implementation into architectural design processes. It revealed two principal aspects: first, the essential role of communities’ involvement in the definition of Sustainability, its implementation and monitoring tools; and second, the vernacular architecture embodies sustainability models that can provide valuable guidance for architectural Biomimicry, particularly in their feasibility, due to the process of integrating learnings from experiences to improve and adapt their architecture over time. The paper exposes these findings and suggests the creation of a Nordic Architectural Sustainability Index for assessing sustainable northern architecture in Nunavik. This index will trigger the reflexive process by analyzing actual biomimetic and vernacular Inuit architecture cases, integrating the contemporary views of stakeholders, including the Inuit community, on architectural Sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Background The growing recognition of the microbiome’s impact on human health and well-being has prompted extensive research into discovering the links between microbiome dysbiosis and disease (healthy) states. However, this valuable information is scattered in unstructured form within biomedical literature. The structured extraction and qualification of microbe-disease interactions are important. In parallel, recent advancements in deep-learning-based natural language processing algorithms have revolutionized language-related tasks such as ours. This study aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep-learning language models to extract microbe-disease relationships from biomedical literature. Results In this study, we first evaluate multiple pre-trained large language models within a zero-shot or few-shot learning context. In this setting, the models performed poorly out of the box, emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning of these language models. Subsequently, we fine-tune multiple language models (specifically, GPT-3, BioGPT, BioMedLM, BERT, BioMegatron, PubMedBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and BioLinkBERT) using labeled training data and evaluate their performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of these fine-tuned models ( specifically GPT-3, BioMedLM, and BioLinkBERT), achieving an average F1 score, precision, and recall of over 
$$>0.8$$
 > 0.8 compared to the previous best of  0.74. Conclusion Overall, this study establishes that pre-trained language models excel as transfer learners when fine-tuned with domain and problem-specific data, enabling them to achieve state-of-the-art results even with limited training data for extracting microbiome-disease interactions from scientific publications.},

  abstract     = {Background and aims Root water uptake (RWU) depends on root development, influenced by water and salt stress (WAS). Modeling RWU requires calibration of soil and root parameters using lysimeter data, which is challenging. The study introduces a global sensitivity index-based estimability method for parameter assessment and selection, optimizing them using observations from lysimeter experiments. Methods A variance-based global sensitivity and estimability analyses was performed on the HYDRUS-1D model. The analyses evaluate the impact of soil hydraulic and stress parameters on pressure head, soil moisture, bottom flux, and electrical conductivity. Interactions among parameters across the root zone were analyzed for model parameter selection. The selected parameters were calibrated from soil-column lysimeter experiments on berseem ( Trifolium alexandrinum ) under saline and non-saline conditions. Results The analyses identify water stress and residual soil moisture as less estimable, while major soil and salt stress parameters as more estimable, especially from bottom flux and soil moisture data. Excluding saturated soil moisture, which strongly influenced parameter estimability, improved optimization results. For the maximum scenarios, the simulated salt-water dynamics showed fair agreement with the observed data ( r ^2 > 0.7). For moderate salinity, reduced RWU was compensated by an increase of 0.01 d^−1, while high salinity significantly reduced this compensation to 0.002 d^−1 with uniform RWU of 0.004 d^−1. Conclusion The study demonstrates how different data sets contribute to accurate parameter estimation. Under high salinity, the compensation mechanism for reduced RWU was diminished, and the prolonged uniform RWU pattern suggested potential permanent root morphological changes.},

  abstract     = {Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disorder, induced by aberrant activation of dendritic cells, followed by modifications in the immune cells (skin) and keratinocytes (epidermis). Previously, to enhance the poor aqueous solubility and photostability, and to enhance preclinical antipsoriatic performance, clobetasol propionate–loaded cyclodextrin nanosponges (CPNS) were fabricated and, subsequently, embedded in Carbopol hydrogel. Pharmacotechnological evaluation, cytocompatibility studies, and in vivo antipsoriatic assay in mouse tail model advocated the significance of the fabricated delivery system for psoriasis. The current study is an extension work to assess the targeting potential of CPNS hydrogel via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to skin strata. Further, to validate the safety of this novel formulation, in vitro skin irritation was performed using the HET-CAM (hen’s egg-chorioallantoic membrane) assay. The results of this study indicated no change in skin barrier function and no sign of erythema or irritation, suggesting the safety of prepared hydrogel for topical application. In vivo antipsoriatic studies were carried out using an imiquimod-induced mouse model to further validate the previous findings. Altogether, the results of phenotypic, histopathological, and biochemical estimations of the current investigation substantiated the profound antipsoriatic potential and safety of CP-loaded nanosponge hydrogel.

  abstract     = {Quantifying daily NOx emissions from a comprehensive range of sources indicates that half of emissions are omitted from existing inventories over South, Southeast and East Asia, suggests an analysis combining remotely sensed nitrogen dioxide and a model-free mass-conserving inverse method. Rapid urbanization and broad use of biomass burning have led to important changes in NO_x [sum of nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide] emissions across South, Southeast, and East Asia, frequently occurring on day-to-day time scales and over areas not identified by existing emissions databases. Here we compute NO_x emissions using remotely sensed NO_2 [nitrogen dioxide] and a model-free mass-conserving inverse method, resulting respectively in 61 kt d^−1 and 40 kt d^−1 from biomass burning in Northern and Southern Continental Southeast Asia, and 14.3 kt d^−1 and 3.7 kt d^−1 from urbanization in China and Eastern South Asia, a net increase more than double existing inventories. Three observationally based physical constraints consistent with theory are found which current chemical transport models cannot match: more NO_2 per unit of NO_x emissions, longer and more variable in-situ lifetime, and longer-range transport. This result provides quantitative support for mitigation efforts targeting specific events, processes, or geographies.},

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis, an inflammatory regulated cell death (RCD) mechanism, is characterized by cellular swelling, membrane rupture, and subsequent discharge of cellular contents, exerting robust proinflammatory effects. Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of pyroptosis, revealing that it can be triggered through inflammasome- and caspase-independent pathways, and interacts intricately with other RCD pathways (e.g., pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis). The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other interstitial lung diseases, involves a multifaceted interplay of factors such as pathogen infections, environmental pollutants, genetic variations, and immune dysfunction. This chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease is characterized by persistent inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and fibrotic alveolar wall thickening, which potentially contribute to deteriorated lung function. Despite recent advances in understanding pyroptosis, the mechanisms by which it regulates PF are not entirely elucidated, and effective strategies to improve clinical outcomes remain unclear. This review strives to deliver a comprehensive overview of the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis, exploring its roles in the pathogenesis of PF. Furthermore, it examines potential biomarkers and therapeutic agents for anti-fibrotic treatments.},

  abstract     = {The settling flux of biodeposition affects the environmental quality of cage culture areas and determines their environmental carrying capacity. Simple and effective simulation of the settling flux of biodeposition is extremely important for determining the spatial distribution of biodeposition. Theoretically, biodeposition in cage culture areas without specific emission rules can be simplified as point source pollution. Fluent is a fluid simulation software that can simulate the dispersion of particulate matter simply and efficiently. Based on the simplification of pollution sources and bays, the settling flux of biodeposition can be easily and effectively simulated by Fluent fluid software. In the present work, the feasibility of this method was evaluated by simulation of the settling flux of biodeposition in Maniao Bay, Hainan Province, China, and 20 sampling sites were selected for determining the settling fluxes. At sampling sites P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, C1, C2, C3 and C4, the measured settling fluxes of biodeposition were 26.02, 15.78, 10.77, 58.16, 6.57, 72.17, 12.37, 12.11, 106.64, 150.96, 22.59, 11.41, 18.03, 7.90, 19.23, 7.06, 11.84, 5.19 and 2.57 g d^−1 m^−2, respectively. The simulated settling fluxes of biodeposition at the corresponding sites were 16.03, 23.98, 8.87, 46.90, 4.52, 104.77, 16.03, 8.35, 180.83, 213.06, 39.10, 17.47, 20.98, 9.78, 23.25, 7.84, 15.90, 6.06 and 1.65gd^−1 m^−2, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the simulated settling fluxes and measured ones ( R = 0.94, P = 2.22×10^−9 < 0.05), which implies that the spatial differentiation of biodeposition flux was well simulated. Moreover, the posterior difference ratio of the simulation was 0.38, and the small error probability was 0.94, which means that the simulated results reached an acceptable level from the perspective of relative error. Thus, if nonpoint source pollution is simplified to point source pollution and open waters are simplified based on similarity theory, the setting flux of biodeposition in the open waters can be simply and effectively simulated by the fluid simulation software Fluent.},

  abstract     = {In lieu of large bioequivalence studies and exposing healthy postmenopausal women to additional drug exposure for elagolix coadministered with hormonal add-back therapy, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling was used with in vitro dissolution data to test for virtual bioequivalence. For endometriosis, elagolix is approved at doses of 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily as a tablet. As a combination therapy, two individual tablets, consisting of an elagolix tablet and an estradiol/norethindrone acetate 1/0.5 mg (E2/NETA) tablet, were utilized in Phase 3 endometriosis trials. However, the commercial combination drug products consist of a morning capsule (containing an elagolix tablet and E2/NETA tablet as a fixed-dose combination capsule, AM capsule) and an evening capsule (consisting of an elagolix tablet, PM capsule). In vitro dissolution profiles were dissimilar for the tablet and capsule formulations; thus, in vivo bioequivalence studies or a bioequivalence waiver would have been required. To simulate virtual cross-over, bioequivalence trials, in vitro dissolution data was incorporated into a previously verified PBPK model. The updated PBPK model was externally validated using relevant bioequivalence study data. Based on results of the virtual bioequivalence simulations, the commercial drug product capsules met the bioequivalence criteria of 0.80–1.25 when compared to the reference tablets. This was a novel example where PBPK modeling was utilized along with in vitro dissolution data to demonstrate virtual bioequivalence in support of a regulatory bioequivalence waiver.

  abstract     = {Current animal protection laws require replacement of animal experiments with alternative methods, whenever such methods are suitable to reach the intended scientific objective. However, searching for alternative methods in the scientific literature is a time-consuming task that requires careful screening of an enormously large number of experimental biomedical publications. The identification of potentially relevant methods, e.g. organ or cell culture models, or computer simulations, can be supported with text mining tools specifically built for this purpose. Such tools are trained (or fine tuned) on relevant data sets labeled by human experts. We developed the GoldHamster corpus, composed of 1,600 PubMed (Medline) articles (titles and abstracts), in which we manually identified the used experimental model according to a set of eight labels, namely: “in vivo”, “organs”, “primary cells”, “immortal cell lines”, “invertebrates”, “humans”, “in silico” and “other” (models). We recruited 13 annotators with expertise in the biomedical domain and assigned each article to two individuals. Four additional rounds of annotation aimed at improving the quality of the annotations with disagreements in the first round. Furthermore, we conducted various machine learning experiments based on supervised learning to evaluate the corpus for our classification task. We obtained more than 7,000 document-level annotations for the above labels. After the first round of annotation, the inter-annotator agreement (kappa coefficient) varied among labels, and ranged from 0.42 (for “others”) to 0.82 (for “invertebrates”), with an overall score of 0.62. All disagreements were resolved in the subsequent rounds of annotation. The best-performing machine learning experiment used the PubMedBERT pre-trained model with fine-tuning to our corpus, which gained an overall f-score of 0.83. We obtained a corpus with high agreement for all labels, and our evaluation demonstrated that our corpus is suitable for training reliable predictive models for automatic classification of biomedical literature according to the used experimental models. Our SMAFIRA - “Smart feature-based interactive” - search tool ( https://smafira.bf3r.de ) will employ this classifier for supporting the retrieval of alternative methods to animal experiments. The corpus is available for download ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7152295 ), as well as the source code ( https://github.com/mariananeves/goldhamster ) and the model ( https://huggingface.co/SMAFIRA/goldhamster ).},

  abstract     = {Foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence by training on vast amounts of broad unlabelled data. Pai et al. present a foundation model leading to more accurate, efficient and robust cancer imaging biomarkers, especially in use cases with small training datasets. Foundation models in deep learning are characterized by a single large-scale model trained on vast amounts of data serving as the foundation for various downstream tasks. Foundation models are generally trained using self-supervised learning and excel in reducing the demand for training samples in downstream applications. This is especially important in medicine, where large labelled datasets are often scarce. Here, we developed a foundation model for cancer imaging biomarker discovery by training a convolutional encoder through self-supervised learning using a comprehensive dataset of 11,467 radiographic lesions. The foundation model was evaluated in distinct and clinically relevant applications of cancer imaging-based biomarkers. We found that it facilitated better and more efficient learning of imaging biomarkers and yielded task-specific models that significantly outperformed conventional supervised and other state-of-the-art pretrained implementations on downstream tasks, especially when training dataset sizes were very limited. Furthermore, the foundation model was more stable to input variations and showed strong associations with underlying biology. Our results demonstrate the tremendous potential of foundation models in discovering new imaging biomarkers that may extend to other clinical use cases and can accelerate the widespread translation of imaging biomarkers into clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {According to the IPCC, most regions worldwide will be gradually exposed to the amplification of the duration, frequency, and intensity of extreme climatic events, and the effects that extreme events can cause on human well-being and the economy. This study aims to develop linear regression models to estimate the soy and maize yields from extreme climatic and bioclimatic indices in three geographical subregions of Latin America (Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina) between 1979 and 2005. We used daily datasets from observations (CPC), reanalysis (ERA5), and regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) to investigate the impact of extreme events of temperature and precipitation on maize and soy yields over the CORDEX Central America and South America domains. We first assessed the RCMs’ performance in reproducing extreme indices by comparing them against observations. The validation process evidenced the need for applying bias correction techniques to simulate daily precipitation and temperature for a better performance of the indices. The results show a higher correlation between the daily temperature range (DTR), cold nights and warm nights for soy production in Argentina (R2: − 0.74, − 0.80 and 0.75, respectively) and Mexico (R2: − 0.80, − 0.81, 0.70) for maize. Regionally, the linear model (simulated with observed data) using these indices presented an agreement with observed yield data in Mexico and Brazil, with explained variances exceeding 70},

Variations in total air flow and air ratio (AR) as the main methods for the gas cleaning system had a significant effect on the gasification temperature, reducing tar, particulate, H_2S, HCl, and NH_3 at 12.50 mg/Nm^3, 6.00 mg/Nm^3, 2.85 mg/Nm^3, 102.60 mg/Nm^3, and 15.25 mg/Nm^3, respectively. Subsequently, a new secondary method for gas cleaning included the external installation of a granular sand bed filter, a venturi scrubber, a spray scrubber, a fixed-bed adsorber with activated carbon, and a ceramic filter to remove contaminants. As a result of using the secondary cleaning method, the concentrations of tar, PM, H_2S, NH_3, and HCl could be reduced to 12.51 mg/Nm^3, 6.02 mg/Nm^3, 2.85 mg/Nm^3, 121.72 mg/Nm^3, and 9.18 mg/Nm^3, respectively. It is possible to conclude that the proposed secondary gas cleaning system, coupled with primary measures, can produce gas with concentrations of pollutants low enough to satisfy fuel cleaning requirements in a SOFC.

People become resistant to antibiotics and because of this the anticipated therapeutic effect is never reached. In-hospital infections are often aggravated and large amounts of money are spent for treating complications in the patients’ condition. In this paper a nonlinear optimal (H-infinity) control method is developed for the dynamic model of bacterial infections exhibiting resistance to antibiotics. First, differential flatness properties are proven for the associated state-space model. Next, the state-space description undergoes approximate linearization with the use of first-order Taylor series expansion and through the computation of the associated Jacobian matrices. The linearization process takes place at each sampling instance around a time-varying operating point which is defined by the present value of the system’s state vector and by the last sampled value of the control inputs vector. For the approximately linearized model of the system a stabilizing H-infinity feedback controller is designed. To compute the controller’s gains an algebraic Riccati equation has to be repetitively solved at each time-step of the control algorithm. The global stability properties of the control scheme are proven through Lyapunov analysis. The proposed method achieves stabilization and remedy for the bacterial infection under moderate use of antibiotics.},

  abstract     = {Background The intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) of cancer cells plays an important role in breast cancer resistance and recurrence. To develop better therapeutic strategies, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ITH and their functional significance. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently been utilized in cancer research. They can also be used to study ITH as cancer cell diversity is thought to be maintained within the organoid line. However, no reports investigated intratumor transcriptomic heterogeneity in organoids derived from patients with breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic ITH in breast cancer PDOs. Methods We established PDO lines from ten patients with breast cancer and performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis. First, we clustered cancer cells for each PDO using the Seurat package. Then, we defined and compared the cluster-specific gene signature (ClustGS) corresponding to each cell cluster in each PDO. Results Cancer cells were clustered into 3–6 cell populations with distinct cellular states in each PDO line. We identified 38 clusters with ClustGS in 10 PDO lines and used Jaccard similarity index to compare the similarity of these signatures. We found that 29 signatures could be categorized into 7 shared meta-ClustGSs, such as those related to the cell cycle or epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and 9 signatures were unique to single PDO lines. These unique cell populations appeared to represent the characteristics of the original tumors derived from patients. Conclusions We confirmed the existence of transcriptomic ITH in breast cancer PDOs. Some cellular states were commonly observed in multiple PDOs, whereas others were specific to single PDO lines. The combination of these shared and unique cellular states formed the ITH of each PDO.},

The quality of these models is hidden because of the limited availability of genomic information and genome-scale metabolic reconstruction methods. In this review, 237 manually curated genome-scale models for various organisms with industrial and clinical significance were comprehensively reviewed, and their modelling information was tabulated based on literature. This review provides a comprehensive summary of potential applications of systems biology in biotechnology and biomedical research. Their broad applicability has been explored in the process of model improvement and design of experiments in metabolic design and drug development. This review summarizes their recent advances, challenges, and practical applications in Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, plants, and animals. Genome-scale models of microbes have been reviewed to address their various applications in metabolic systems engineering, strain optimization, bioremediation, biomanufacturing, and personalized systems medicine. Several models have been explored to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, virulence, host-microbe interactions, and metabolic crosstalk. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on human metabolic reconstructions and their important roles in human, microbiota-related, and complex metabolic disorders. Genome-scale models of human and animal metals offer ethical alternatives to the traditional animal testing methods. Current progress in systems biology research will lead to the development of indispensable databases, computational tools, and analytical platforms. This will strengthen data-driven discovery and facilitate integration of biological information into living systems.},

A well compiled and developed knowledge representation of biological entity can help designers and organizations to understand complex biological entity and develop concepts based on that knowledge. At present, such knowledge frameworks are unavailable. For filling this gap, a 6W framework has been developed based on the hierarchical top-down approach. This standard framework has been proposed for capturing and representing information about natural entities. This framework extracts information using formal 6W questions about function, form, behavior, structure, location and nature’s intent hierarchy part wise for the natural entity.

Integrating biometric authentication into software applications, particularly within the ‘low-code/no-code’ paradigm, causes unique challenges. This paper presents a case study demonstrating the seamless implementation of a pre-built biometric authentication component within a selected low-code programming platform. This approach describes and elaborates an existing component that empowers developers to incorporate biometric authentication without delving into complex technological details. This platform-agnostic component enhances security and convenience, helping with effective development of iOS and Android applications sharing the whole or the majority of the source code.

They can govern ecological dynamics in microbial communities and indicate metabolic cross-feeding interactions among coexisting genotypes. Despite the ecological importance of auxotrophies, their distribution and impact on the diversity and function of the human gut microbiome remain poorly understood. This study performed the first systematic analysis of the distribution of amino acid auxotrophies in the human gut microbiome using a combined metabolomic, metagenomic, and metabolic modeling approach. Results showed that amino acid auxotrophies are ubiquitous in the colon microbiome, with tryptophan auxotrophy being the most common. Auxotrophy frequencies were higher for those amino acids that are also essential to the human host. Moreover, a higher overall abundance of auxotrophies was associated with greater microbiome diversity and stability, and the distribution of auxotrophs was found to be related to the human host’s metabolome, including trimethylamine oxide, small aromatic acids, and secondary bile acids. Thus, our results suggest that amino acid auxotrophies are important factors contributing to microbiome ecology and host-microbiome metabolic interactions.},

This study reconstructs GRN models for five key anaerobes—a hyper-ammonia-producing anaerobe Acetoanaerobium sticklandii H1, an anaerobic sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, a hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ΔH, a heterotrophic methanogen Methanosarcina mazei Gö1, and a methylotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis MS2T—using genome-wide data to understand their metabolic regulation in AD processes. These GRNs integrate gene regulatory elements, thereby revealing species-specific adaptations that facilitate ammonia tolerance, substrate metabolism, and methane production. Regulatory elements, such as ExsA, PtxR, and GadW, influence pathways for carbon, nitrogen, and energy metabolism. A. sticklandii and M. mazei were crucial for carbon source utilization, whereas M. bourgensis adapted to ammonium-rich conditions without a typical ammonium uptake system. The results of our study provide insights into the metabolic interactions and regulatory roles within biogas-producing communities. This work proposes a framework for designing synthetic microbial communities to enhance biomethane yield from protein-based substrates, supporting AD efficiency improvements.},

Here we estimate the response of SOC to climate extreme shifts under 1.5 °C warming by combining a space-for-time substitution approach and global SOC measurements (0–30 cm soil). Most extremes (22 out of 33 assessed extreme types) exacerbate SOC loss under warming globally, but their effects vary among ecosystems. Only decreasing duration of cold spells exerts consistent positive effects, and increasing extreme wet days exerts negative effects in all ecosystems. Temperate grasslands and croplands negatively respond to most extremes, while positive responses are dominant in temperate and boreal forests and deserts. In tundra, 21 extremes show neutral effects, but 11 extremes show negative effects with stronger magnitude than in other ecosystems. Our results reveal distinct, biome-specific effects of climate extremes on SOC dynamics, promoting more reliable SOC projection under climate change. Warming temperatures associated with climate change are expected to impact soil carbon stocks, yet the effect of more frequent and intense extreme climate events on soil carbon is yet unclear. This study shows that most extremes enhance soil carbon loss globally, with variation across ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {In today’s globalized agricultural system, information leakage of agricultural biological risk factors can lead to business risks and public panic, jeopardizing corporate reputation. To solve the above problems, this study constructs a blockchain network for agricultural product biological risk traceability based on agricultural product biological risk factor data to achieve traceability of biological risk traceability data of agricultural product supply chain to meet the sustainability challenges. To guarantee the secure and flexible sharing of agricultural product biological risk privacy information and limit the scope of privacy information dissemination, the blockchain-based proxy re-encryption access control method (BBPR-AC) is designed. Aiming at the problems of proxy re-encryption technology, such as the third-party agent being prone to evil, the authorization judgment being cumbersome, and the authorization process not automated, we design the proxy re-encryption access control mechanism based on the traceability of agricultural products’ biological risk factors. Designing an attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanism based on the traceability blockchain for agricultural products involves defining the attributes of each link in the agricultural supply chain, formulating policies, and evaluating and executing these policies, deployed in the blockchain system in the form of smart contracts. This approach achieves decentralization of authorization and automation of authority judgment. By analyzing the data characteristics within the agricultural product supply chain to avoid the malicious behavior of third-party agents, the decentralized blockchain system acts as a trusted third-party agent, and the proxy re-encryption is combined with symmetric encryption to improve the encryption efficiency. This ensures a efficient encryption process, making the system safe, transparent, and efficient. Finally, a prototype blockchain system for traceability of agricultural biological risk factors is built based on Hyperledger Fabric to verify this research method’s reliability, security, and efficiency. The experimental results show that this research scheme’s initial encryption, re-encryption, and decryption sessions exhibit lower computational overheads than traditional encryption methods. When the number of policies and the number of requests in the access control session is 100, the policy query latency is less than 400 ms, the request-response latency is slightly more than 360ms, and the data uploading throughput is 48.7 tx/s. The data query throughput is 81.8 tx/s, the system performance consumption is low and can meet the biological risk privacy protection needs of the agricultural supply chain. The BBPR-AC method proposed in this study provides ideas for achieving refined traceability management in the agricultural supply chain and promoting digital transformation in the agricultural industry.},

Here, the authors report an improved genome-scale metabolic model, develop an intermediate-chassis to bypass the dominant ethanol pathway, and demonstrate the application potential of using lignocellulosic waste for D-lactate production. The development and implementation of microbial chassis cells have profound impacts on circular economy. Non-model bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is an excellent chassis owing to its extraordinary industrial characteristics. Here, the genome-scale metabolic model i ZM516 is improved and updated by integrating enzyme constraints to simulate the dynamics of flux distribution and guide pathway design. We show that the innate dominant ethanol pathway of Z. mobilis restricts the titer and rate of these biochemicals. A dominant-metabolism compromised intermediate-chassis (DMCI) strategy is then developed through introducing low toxicity but cofactor imbalanced 2,3-butanediol pathway, and a recombinant D-lactate producer is constructed to produce more than 140.92 g/L and 104.6 g/L D-lactate (yield > 0.97 g/g) from glucose and corncob residue hydrolysate, respectively. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrate the commercialization feasibility and greenhouse gas reduction capability of lignocellulosic D-lactate. This work thus establishes a paradigm for engineering recalcitrant microorganisms as biorefinery chassis.},

  abstract     = {Background A method combining offline techniques and the just-in-time learning strategy (JITL) is proposed, because the biochemical reaction process often encounters changing features and parameters over time. Methods Firstly, multiple sub-databases in the fermentation process are constructed offline by an improved fuzzy C-means algorithm and the sample data are adaptively pruned by a similarity query threshold. Secondly, an improved eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method is used on the online modeling stage to build soft sensor models, and the multi-similarity-driven just-in-time learning strategy is used to increase the diversity of the model. Finally, to improve the generalization of the whole algorithm, the output of the base learner is fused by an improved Stacking integration model and then the predictive output is performed. Results Applying the constructed soft sensor model to the problem of predicting cell concentration and product concentration in Pichia pastoris fermentation process. The experimental results show that the root mean square error of the cell concentration is 0.0260, the coefficient of determination is 0.9945, the root mean square error of the product concentration is 2.6688, and the coefficient of determination is 0.9970. It shows that the proposed method has the advantages of timely prediction and high prediction accuracy, which validates the effectiveness and practicality of the method. Conclusion The JS-ISSA-XGBoost is an extensive and excellent soft measurement model that meets the practical needs for real-time monitoring of parameters and prediction of control in biochemical reactions.},

Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve a better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model’s performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.},

  abstract     = {The influence of clay mineral content on biogenic gas production in coal seams remains insufficiently understood. This study systematically investigated the mechanisms by which clay minerals affect biogas production in low- and medium-rank coals by integrating simulated biogas production experiments with multidimensional analytical techniques, including infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, and metagenomic analysis. The results demonstrated that in low-rank coal, increasing the clay content from 2.78 to 4.75 g per 20 g of coal reduced the biogas yield from 6.30 to 3.47 mL/g. Conversely, in medium-rank coal, increasing the clay content from 1.66 to 2.65 g per 20 g of coal enhanced the biogas yield from 3.45 to 5.28 mL/g. These contrasting outcomes are primarily attributed to the distinct mechanistic roles of clay minerals across coal ranks. In low-rank coal, the hydration-induced swelling of clay minerals intensified pore blockage, impeded gas diffusion, decreased the abundance of genes involved in propionate degradation, and suppressed microbial metabolic activity, ultimately limiting methane production. In contrast, in medium-rank coal, clay minerals facilitated the enrichment of key functional microbial taxa, such as Acetobacteroides and Methanoculleus , promoted the degradation of fatty acids, hydroxyls, and amines, and enhanced the activity of acidogenic and methanogenic pathways, thereby increasing methane yield. This study elucidates the microbial mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of clay minerals in biogas production, offering new theoretical insights into the origin of coalbed methane (CBM) and providing a scientific foundation for optimizing biogenic CBM recovery.},

  abstract     = {Error attribution based on modelled relationships and satellite observations suggests that errors in global models are more important and require more concerns than emission errors in creating the overall uncertainties for biomass burning aerosols. Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of aerosols that remain the most uncertain components of the global radiative forcing. Current global models have great difficulty matching observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) over BB regions. A common solution to address modelled AOD biases is scaling BB emissions. Using the relationship from an ensemble of aerosol models and satellite observations, we show that the bias in aerosol modelling results primarily from incorrect lifetimes and underestimated mass extinction coefficients. In turn, these biases seem to be related to incorrect precipitation and underestimated particle sizes. We further show that boosting BB emissions to correct AOD biases over the source region causes an overestimation of AOD in the outflow from Africa by 48},

  abstract     = {Predicting the time course of motion sickness symptoms enables the evaluation of provocative stimuli and the development of countermeasures for reducing symptom severity. In pursuit of this goal, we present an Observer-driven model of motion sickness for passive motions in the dark. Constructed in two stages, this model predicts motion sickness symptoms by bridging sensory conflict (i.e., differences between actual and expected sensory signals) arising from the Observer model of spatial orientation perception (stage 1) to Oman’s model of motion sickness symptom dynamics (stage 2; presented in 1982 and 1990) through a proposed “Normalized Innovation Squared” statistic. The model outputs the expected temporal development of human motion sickness symptom magnitudes (mapped to the Misery Scale) at a population level, due to arbitrary, 6-degree-of-freedom, self-motion stimuli. We trained model parameters using individual subject responses collected during fore-aft translations and off-vertical axis of rotation motions. Improving on prior efforts, we only used datasets with experimental conditions congruent with the perceptual stage (i.e., adequately provided passive motions without visual cues) to inform the model. We assessed model performance by predicting an unseen validation dataset, producing a Q ^2 value of 0.91. Demonstrating this model’s broad applicability, we formulate predictions for a host of stimuli, including translations, earth-vertical rotations, and altered gravity, and we provide our implementation for other users. Finally, to guide future research efforts, we suggest how to rigorously advance this model (e.g., incorporating visual cues, active motion, responses to motion of different frequency, etc.).},

  abstract     = {Interpreting and creating computational systems models is an important goal of science education. One aspect of computational systems modeling that is supported by modeling, systems thinking, and computational thinking literature is “testing, evaluating, and debugging models.” Through testing and debugging, students can identify aspects of their models that either do not match external data or conflict with their conceptual understandings of a phenomenon. This disconnect encourages students to make model revisions, which in turn deepens their conceptual understanding of a phenomenon. Given that many students find testing and debugging challenging, we set out to investigate the various testing and debugging behaviors and behavioral patterns that students use when building and revising computational system models in a supportive learning environment. We designed and implemented a 6-week unit where students constructed and revised a computational systems model of evaporative cooling using SageModeler software. Our results suggest that despite being in a common classroom, the three groups of students in this study all utilized different testing and debugging behavioral patterns. Group 1 focused on using external peer feedback to identify flaws in their model, group 2 used verbal and written discourse to critique their model’s structure and suggest structural changes, and group 3 relied on systemic analysis of model output to drive model revisions. These results suggest that multiple aspects of the learning environment are necessary to enable students to take these different approaches to testing and debugging.},

  abstract     = {Background Experimental knee implant wear testing according to ISO 14243 is a standard procedure, but it inherently possesses limitations for preclinical evaluations due to extended testing periods and costly infrastructure. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we hereby develop and experimentally validate a finite-element (FE)-based algorithm, including a novel cross-shear and contact pressure dependent wear and creep model, and apply it towards understanding the sensitivity of wear outcomes to the applied boundary conditions. Methods Specifically, we investigated the application of in vivo data for level walking from the publicly available “Stan” data set, which contains single representative tibiofemoral loads and kinematics derived from in vivo measurements of six subjects, and compared wear outcomes against those obtained using the ISO standard boundary conditions. To provide validation of the numerical models, this comparison was reproduced experimentally on a six-station knee wear simulator over 5 million cycles, testing the same implant Stan’s data was obtained from. Results Experimental implementation of Stan’s boundary conditions in displacement control resulted in approximately three times higher wear rates (4.4 vs. 1.6 mm^3 per million cycles) and a more anterior wear pattern compared to the ISO standard in force control. While a force-controlled ISO FE model was unable to reproduce the bench test kinematics, and thus wear rate, due to a necessarily simplified representation of the simulator machine, similar but displacement-controlled FE models accurately predicted the laboratory wear tests for both ISO and Stan boundary conditions. The credibility of the in silico wear and creep model was further established per the ASME V   V-40 standard. Conclusions The FE wear model is suitable for supporting future patient-specific models and development of novel implant designs. Incorporating the Stan data set alongside ISO boundary conditions emphasized the value of using measured kinematics in displacement control for reliably replicating in vivo joint mechanics in wear simulation. Future work should focus on expanding the range of daily activities simulated and addressing model sensitivity to contact mechanics to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The recent development of battery electric trucks (BETs) suggests that they could play a vital role in transitioning to zero-emission road freight. To facilitate this transition, it is important to understand under which conditions BETs can be a viable alternative to internal combustion engine trucks (ICETs). Concurrently, the advancement of autonomous driving technology adds uncertainty and complexity to analyzing how the cost competitiveness of future zero-emissions trucks, such as autonomous electric trucks (AETs) may develop. This study examines the cost performance of BETs and AETs compared to ICETs, and how it varies over different market and technology conditions, charging strategies, and transport applications. Focus is on heavy-duty tractor-trailer trucks operating full truckload shuttle-flows in Sweden. Due to the inherent uncertainty and interactions among the analyzed factors, the analysis is performed as computational experiments using a simulation model of BET, AET, and ICET shuttle flow operations and associated costs. In total, 19,200 experiments are performed by sampling the model across 1200 scenarios representing various transport applications and technical and economic conditions for sixteen charging strategies with different combinations of depot, destination, and en route charging. The results indicate that both BETs and AETs are cost competitive compared to ICETs in a large share of scenarios. High asset utilization is important for offsetting additional investment costs in vehicles and chargers, highlighting the importance of deploying these vehicles in applications that enable high productivity. The cost performance for BETs is primarily influenced by energy related costs, charging strategy, and charging infrastructure utilization. The AET cost performance is in addition heavily affected by remote operations cost, and costs for the automated driving system. When feasible, relying only on depot charging is in many scenarios the most cost-effective charging strategy, with the primary exceptions being highly energy-demanding scenarios with long distances and heavy goods in which the required battery is too heavy to operate the truck within vehicle weight regulations if not complemented by destination, or en route charging. However, many experiments do not lead to a reduced payload capacity for BETs and AETs compared to ICETs, and a large majority of the considered scenarios are feasible to operate with a BET or AET within current gross vehicle weight regulations.},

  abstract     = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a promising technique for privacy-persevering applications. A number of MPC frameworks have been proposed to reduce the burden of designing customized protocols, allowing non-experts to quickly develop and deploy MPC applications. To improve performance, recent MPC frameworks allow users to declare variables secret only for these which are to be protected. However, in practice, it is usually highly non-trivial for non-experts to specify secret variables: declaring too many degrades the performance while declaring too less compromises privacy. To address this problem, in this work we propose an automated security policy synthesis approach to declare as few secret variables as possible but without compromising security. Our approach is a synergistic integration of type inference and symbolic reasoning. The former is able to quickly infer a sound—but sometimes conservative—security policy, whereas the latter allows to identify secret variables in a security policy that can be declassified in a precise manner. Moreover, the results from symbolic reasoning are fed back to type inference to refine the security types even further. We implement our approach in a new tool PoS4MPC . Experimental results on five typical MPC applications confirm the efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Atomic cascades refer—first and foremost—to the stepwise de-excitation of excited atoms owing to the emission of electrons or photons. Apart from dedicated experiments at storage rings and synchrotrons, such cascades frequently occur in astro and plasma physics, material research, surface science and at various places elsewhere. In addition, moreover, “atomic cascades” have been found a useful concept for modeling atomic behavior under different conditions, for instance, when dealing with the photoabsorption of matter, the generation of synthesized spectra, or for determining a rather wide class of (plasma) rate coefficients. We here compile and discuss several atomic cascades (schemes) that help predict cross sections, rate coefficients, electron and photon spectra, or ion distributions. We also demonstrate how readily these schemes have been implemented within JAC, the Jena Atomic Calculator. Emphasis is placed on the classification of atomic cascades and their (quite) natural breakdown into cascade computations , to deal with the electronic structure and transition amplitudes of atoms and ions, as well as the cascade simulation of those properties and spectra, that are experimentally accessible. As an example, we show and discuss the computation of dielectronic recombination plasma rate coefficients for beryllium-like gold ions. The concept of atomic cascades and its implementation into JAC can be applied for most ions across the periodic table and will facilitate the modeling and interpretation of many forthcoming observations.

  abstract     = {Reproducibility is essential in scientific experiments to ensure that results can be consistently obtained using new data and methods across studies to answer the same scientific question. It evaluates the validity and robustness of the results. A scientific workflow management system (SWfMS) offers specialized tools for data analysis, modelling, and visualization, streamlining complex analyses and accelerating discoveries. It facilitates reproducibility by providing a standardized environment for executing scientific experiments. However, external scientific experiments often utilize tools developed independently by researchers, employing diverse programming languages and operating systems. Reproducing these experiments within an SWfMS requires installation, configuration, and incorporation of the tools into the SWfMS environment for composition, execution, and analysis of workflows. Managing a multi-user SWfMS is challenging, especially when integrating and configuring a diverse array of scientific tools. Many tools require elevated privileges either during installation or execution, creating roadblocks for efficient onboarding and potentially compromising security. Dissimilarities between the SWfMS and individual tool environments can render straightforward installation impossible, requiring time-consuming workarounds. These challenges burden administrators and impede research progress by hindering the seamless reproduction of critical scientific experiments. Our research addressed the critical challenge of reproducing external scientific experiments within SWfMSs. The complex process of integrating diverse software tools and executing them within the SWfMS runtime infrastructure often hinders reproducibility. We conducted a user study to investigate researchers’ challenges during experiment reproduction in SWfMSs. Based on the identified pain points, we propose a solution that empowers domain experts to package their tools within self-contained, isolated Docker containers. These containers can then be seamlessly uploaded to the system via a user-friendly graphical interface, eliminating installation obstacles and facilitating integration with the SWfMS runtime environment. Furthermore, we conducted another user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, ensuring its practical utility for researchers in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the heart, electrophysiological dysregulation arises from defects at many biological levels (from point mutations in ion channel proteins to gross structural abnormalities). These defects disrupt the normal pattern of electrical activation, producing ectopic activity and reentrant arrhythmia. To interrogate mechanisms that link these primary biological defects to macroscopic electrophysiologic dysregulation most prior computational studies have utilized either (i) detailed models of myocyte ion channel dynamics at limited spatial scales, or (ii) homogenized models of action potential conduction that reproduce arrhythmic activity at tissue and organ levels. Here we apply our recent model (EMI), which integrates electrical activation and propagation across these scales, to study human atrial arrhythmias originating in the pulmonary vein (PV) sleeves. These small structures initiate most supraventricular arrhythmias and include pronounced myocyte-to-myocyte heterogeneities in ion channel expression and intercellular coupling. To test EMI’s cell-based architecture in this physiological context we asked whether ion channel mutations known to underlie atrial fibrillation are capable of initiating arrhythmogenic behavior via increased excitability or reentry in a schematic PV sleeve geometry. Our results illustrate that EMI’s improved spatial resolution can directly interrogate how electrophysiological changes at the individual myocyte level manifest in tissue and as arrhythmia in the PV sleeve.},

  abstract     = {The increasing frequency of flood disasters around the globe highlights the need for creative approaches to improve disaster preparedness. This thorough analysis and assessment explore the topic of enhancing flood disaster resilience by utilising cutting-edge geo-computational techniques. By combining a variety of techniques, such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), LiDAR, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and geospatial big data analytics, the study provides a complex framework for flood monitoring, risk assessment, and mitigation. By using remote sensing technology, flood occurrences can be tracked in real time and inundations may be precisely mapped, which makes proactive response plans possible. GIS facilitates effective evacuation planning by streamlining spatial analysis and decision-making procedures and providing critical insights into risky locations. High-resolution elevation data is provided by LiDAR technology, which is essential for precise flood modelling and simulation. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may be quickly deployed to assist with situational awareness and damage assessment during a disaster. Furthermore, predictive skills are enhanced by the combination of machine learning and geographic big data analytics, opening the door to the creation of adaptive reaction plans and early warning systems. This investigation highlights how geo-computational tools may significantly improve community resilience and lessen the negative effects of flood disasters. After a thorough review of the literature and case studies, this study clarifies how these approaches might improve disaster response and preparation to a great extent.},

  abstract     = {Modern microwave devices are designed to fulfill stringent requirements pertaining to electrical performance, which requires, among others, a meticulous tuning of their geometry parameters. When moving up in frequency, physical dimensions of passive microwave circuits become smaller, making the system performance increasingly susceptible to manufacturing tolerances. In particular, inherent inaccuracy of fabrication processes affect the fundamental operating parameters, such as center frequency or bandwidth, which is especially troublesome for narrow-band structures, including notch filters. The ability to quantify the effects of tolerances, and—even more—to account for these in the design process, are instrumental in making the designs more reliable, and to increase the likelihood that adequate operation is ensured despite manufacturing errors. This paper proposes a simple yet computationally efficient and reliable procedure for statistical analysis and yield optimization of resonator-based notch filters. Our methodology involves feature-based surrogate models that can be established using a handful of training data points, and employed for rapid evaluation of the circuit fabrication yield. Furthermore, a yield optimization procedure is developed, which iteratively sets up a sequence of feature-based models, constructed within local domains relocated along the optimization path, and uses them as predictors to find a robust (maximum yield) design at a low computational cost. The presented approach has been demonstrated using two complementary split ring resonator (CSRR)-based notch filters. The cost of statistical design is about a hundred of EM simulations of the respective filter, with yield evaluation reliability corroborated through EM-based Monte Carlo analysis.},

Obtaining target properties and component performance through experimental route needs many trials due to several interconnected phenomena occurring across the long processing route. A computational framework that considers evolution of the component and its microstructure across the entire process chain can help accelerate the product development process significantly. This paper presents an ICME (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering) based solution involving a combination of process models coupled with microstructure evolution models. Further, these models are integrated on a knowledge guidance framework to facilitate guided parameter selection at each stage, leading to fewer computational trials and faster achievement of target requirements. In this study, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework in achieving the desired preform properties for an IN718 final component.},

The novel formulations of the myocardium allows us to simulate and analyze the remodelling of actively contracting human ventricular heart models which consist of growing viscoelastic myocardium where the growth direction is determined based on its mechanical state at each time step. The total deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into a mechanical-active part and a growth part, where the mechanical-active part is further split into elastic, viscous, and active components. Unconditional stability of time integration is ensured by a backward Euler integration scheme. With the developed model, the myocardium can experience stretch-driven longitudinal (fibre) growth and stress-driven transverse (cross-fibre) growth. To validate the developed approach, two simulations regarding pathological ventricular remodelling are implemented: two divergent types of remodelling of a left ventricular model driven by hemodynamic overloads and ventricular remodelling triggered by acute myocardial ischemia in a biventricular heart model.},

This process resulted in four science fiction stories, which aim to capture the complexity of the system, embrace the inherent uncertainty of the future and question current unsustainable trajectories, while emphasizing the vastness of future option space. The visions are analyzed using the concept of imaginaries, demonstrating that futuristic stories can be traced back to current realities and the scientific evidence they were based upon.

Results Results characterized different levels of engagement with computational model-based learning in the form of problem formulation and model planning, implementation and use of the computational model, evaluation, and interpretation of the outputs of the model, as well as reflection on the process. Results report on students’ levels of representational competence as related to the computational model, meaning-making of the underlying code of the computational model, graphical representations generated by the model, and explanations and interpretations of the output representations. Results also described regulatory skills as challenges and strategies related to programming skills, challenges and strategies related to meaning-making skills for understanding and connecting the science to the code and the results, and challenges and strategies related to process management mainly focused on project management skills. Conclusion Characterizing dimensions of computational model-based reasoning provides insights that showcase students’ learning, benefits, and challenges when engaging in team-based computational modeling and simulation projects.

  abstract     = {During the Ross procedure, an aortic heart valve is replaced by a patient’s own pulmonary valve. The pulmonary autograft subsequently undergoes substantial growth and remodeling (G   R) due to its exposure to increased hemodynamic loads. In this study, we developed a homogenized constrained mixture model to understand the observed adaptation of the autograft leaflets in response to the changed hemodynamic environment. This model was based on the hypothesis that tissue G   R aims to preserve mechanical homeostasis for each tissue constituent. To model the Ross procedure, we simulated the exposure of a pulmonary valve to aortic pressure conditions and the subsequent G   R of the valve. Specifically, we investigated the effects of assuming either stress- or stretch-based mechanical homeostasis, the use of blood pressure control, and the effect of root dilation. With this model, we could explain different observations from published clinical studies, such as the increase in thickness, change in collagen organization, and change in tissue composition. In addition, we found that G   R based on stress-based homeostasis could better capture the observed changes in tissue composition than G   R based on stretch-based homeostasis, and that root dilation or blood pressure control can result in more leaflet elongation. Finally, our model demonstrated that successful adaptation can only occur when the mechanically induced tissue deposition is sufficiently larger than tissue degradation, such that leaflet thickening overrules leaflet dilation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that G   R based on mechanical homeostasis can capture the observed heart valve adaptation after the Ross procedure. Finally, this study presents a novel homogenized mixture model that can be used to investigate other cases of heart valve G   R as well.},

  abstract     = {Performance-based earthquake engineering offers a versatile framework for quantifying the seismic performance of structures. Its implementation requires a comprehensive description of the nonlinear structural behavior, facilitated typically via multiple nonlinear response history analyses (NLRHAs). This burden can be very high when high-fidelity finite element models (FEMs) are used to describe structural response. To alleviate it, approximations are commonly employed, using a moderate number of analyses, or even replacing altogether the NLRHA with a nonlinear static analysis. This contribution explores two alternative paths for accommodating the desired computational efficiency: (a) use of reduced order models that are calibrated to closely match the original FEM; (b) adoption of multi-fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) that combines the original FEM to guarantee unbiased predictions and the aforementioned reduced order models to accelerate the Monte Carlo implementation. Advancements are established for the MFMC implementation, in order to accommodate the efficient propagation of the different sources of uncertainty across the estimation of the different seismic performance statistics of interest. The accuracy and computational benefits are illustrated for two benchmark structures over two different output variables: repair cost (resiliency quantification) and embodied energy associated with repairs (sustainability quantification).},

  abstract     = {Building on Gabor seminal principle, digital in-line holographic microscopy provides efficient means for space–time investigations of large volumes of interest. Thus, it has a pivotal impact on particle tracking that is crucial in advancing various branches of science and technology, e.g., microfluidics and biophysical processes examination (cell motility, migration, interplay etc.). Well-established algorithms often rely on heavily regularized inverse problem modelling and encounter limitations in terms of tracking accuracy, hologram signal-to-noise ratio, accessible object volume, particle concentration and computational burden. This work demonstrates the DarkTrack algorithm—a new approach to versatile, fast, precise, and robust 4D holographic tracking based on deterministic computationally rendered high-contrast dark fields. Its unique capabilities are quantitatively corroborated employing a novel numerical engine for simulating Gabor holographic recording of time-variant volumes filled with predefined dynamic particles. Our solution accounts for multiple scattering and thus it is poised to secure an important gap in holographic particle tracking technology and allow for ground-truth-driven benchmarking and quantitative assessment of tracking algorithms. Proof-of-concept experimental evaluation of DarkTrack is presented via analyzing live spermatozoa. Software supporting both novel numerical holographic engine and DarkTrack algorithm is made open access , which opens new possibilities and sets the stage for democratization of robust holographic 4D particle examination.},

  abstract     = {Background The rapidly growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has expanded the number of multidisease models predicting future care needs and health system priorities. Usefulness of these models depends on their ability to replicate real-life data and be readily understood and applied by public health decision-makers; yet existing simulation models of HIV comorbidities are computationally expensive and require large numbers of parameters and long run times, which hinders their utility in resource-constrained settings. Methods We present a novel, user-friendly emulator that can efficiently approximate complex simulators of long-term HIV and NCD outcomes in Africa. We describe how to implement the emulator via a tutorial based on publicly available data from Kenya. Emulator parameters relating to incidence and prevalence of HIV, hypertension and depression were derived from our own agent-based simulation model and other published literature. Gaussian processes were used to fit the emulator to simulator estimates, assuming presence of noise for design points. Bayesian posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross validation confirmed the emulator’s descriptive accuracy. Results In this example, our emulator resulted in a 13-fold (95},

  abstract     = {Tumor angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels towards a tumor, plays a critical role in cancer progression. Tumors release tumor angiogenic factors (TAF) that trigger angiogenesis upon reaching a pre-existing capillary. Although not frequently studied, the convective transport of TAF plays a key role in determining the resulting shape of the vasculature. In this work, we propose a computational method that couples an angiogenesis model with Stokes–Darcy flow to simulate the impact of flow on angiogenesis. We use the phase-field method to implicitly describe the vasculature and capture the temporally evolving interface between the intra- and extravascular flow. The implicit description of the interface eliminates the need to re-mesh the vasculature which would otherwise be required due to the movement of the interface. We propose a finite-element discretization to solve the coupled problem and illustrate the accuracy of the algorithm by comparing a numerical solution with a manufactured test case in a simplified scenario. The numerical simulations demonstrate the impact of the convective transport of TAF on the shape of the vasculature. It predicts that the vasculature network grows prominently against the flow direction and that the growth of vasculature is enhanced with increasing interstitial flow magnitude.},

Motivated by the relationship between the eigenvalues and the entries in the circular Toeplitz matrix, each entry expression of inverse matrix is firstly derived through mathematical deduction, and then, the matrix multiplication is simplified into a more efficient convolution operation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the computational speed by one to two orders of magnitude and is even more efficient for contour extraction with large perimeter.},

  abstract     = {Supervisor synthesis is a means to algorithmically derive a supervisory controller from a discrete-event model of a system and a requirements specification. For large systems, synthesis suffers from state space explosion. To mitigate this, synthesis can be applied to a symbolic representation of the models by using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Peak used BDD nodes and BDD operation count are introduced as deterministic and platform independent metrics to express the computational effort of a symbolic synthesis. These BDD-based metrics are useful to analyze the efficiency of the synthesis algorithm. From this analysis, modifications can be made to how BDDs are handled during synthesis, improving synthesis efficiency. We demonstrate this approach by introducing and analyzing: DCSH, a variable ordering heuristic; several edge ordering heuristics; and an approach to efficiently enforce state exclusion requirements in synthesis. These methods were recently implemented in our open source supervisory control tool: Eclipse ESCET. The analysis is based on large scale experiments of performing synthesis on a variety of models from literature. We show that: (1) by using DCSH, synthesis with high computational effort can be avoided, and generally low computational effort is required, relative to the variable ordering heuristics that were used prior to this work; (2) applying reverse-model edge order realizes relatively low synthesis effort; and (3) state exclusion requirements can efficiently be enforced by restricting edge guards prior to synthesis. While these methods reduce computational effort in practice, it should be noted that they do not affect the theoretical (worst-case) complexity of synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Background Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing cells are a powerful modality of adoptive cell therapy against cancer. The potency of signaling events initiated upon antigen binding depends on the costimulatory domain within the structure of the CAR. One such costimulatory domain is 4-1BB, which affects cellular response via the NFκB pathway. However, the quantitative aspects of 4-1BB-induced NFκB signaling are not fully understood. Methods We developed an ordinary differential equation-based mathematical model representing canonical NFκB signaling activated by CD19scFv-4-1BB. After a global sensitivity analysis on model parameters, we ran Monte Carlo simulations of cell population-wide variability in NFκB signaling and quantified the mutual information between the extracellular signal and different levels of the NFκB signal transduction pathway. Results In response to a wide range of antigen concentrations, the magnitude of the transient peak in NFκB nuclear concentration varies significantly, while the timing of this peak is relatively consistent. Global sensitivity analysis showed that the model is robust to variations in parameters, and thus, its quantitative predictions would remain applicable to a broad range of parameter values. The model predicts that overexpressing NEMO and disabling IKKβ deactivation can increase the mutual information between antigen levels and NFκB activation. Conclusions Our modeling predictions provide actionable insights to guide CAR development. Particularly, we propose specific manipulations to the NFκB signal transduction pathway that can fine-tune the response of CD19scFv-4-1BB cells to the antigen concentrations they are likely to encounter.

  abstract     = {Integrated computational materials engineering has enabled a paradigm shift in the approach to materials design. Using predictive process–structure–property models in an inductive manner can enable rapid design of composition, process, and microstructures, to achieve specific property objectives. However, in realistic complex engineering applications there tends to be competing objectives as well as complex process–structure–property relationships with multiple sources of uncertainty that can affect performance. The concept of robust design can be leveraged to reduce variability and achieve design objectives in the face of uncertainty. This work applies CALPHAD modeling to predict process–structure relationships and crystal plasticity finite element method to predict structure–property relationships for static and microstructure-sensitive multiaxial fatigue properties of Ti64. A framework for uncertainty–informed inductive design exploration is demonstrated, quantifying aleatory uncertainty resulting from microstructure stochasticity and epistemic uncertainty resulting from model form and model parameters, and propagating uncertainty through process–structure–property linkages, utilizing Gaussian process machine learning surrogate models to accelerate the propagation of uncertainty from microstructure to multiaxial fatigue properties. The results show the advantages of considering uncertainty, providing unique optimal and robust design outcomes. Below is the link to the editor’s video summary. Summary (MP4 304423 kb)},

However, it suffers from the big data issue due to its cubic time complexity and square memory complexity with the data size. This becomes even exacerbated for iterative design optimization. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new data sparsification method for multi-fidelity surrogate-based optimization (MFSBO). It includes two key components: reduced design space and data filtering (RDS   DF), which alleviate the surrogate modeling complexity and time for improved efficiency while balancing between exploration and exploitation during optimization. RDS   DF is also combined with an expected improvement reduction (EIR)-based infill technique (Yang et al. in Struct Multidiscip Optim, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-022-03240-x ), enabling both parsimony and computational awareness for MFSBO. Two case studies are conducted to examine the proposed method. Results demonstrate that a significant reduction in the modeling and thus optimization time (69.49},

  abstract     = {Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has broken out and spread rapidly in many countries and regions around the world. Since the outbreak, many researchers have proposed propagation models of COVID-19, among which the mainstream computational epidemiology model requires the establishment of a corresponding artificial society model for computational experiments. However, such models tightly coupled domain knowledge about epidemics with computational models and have low reusability. On this basis, we take COVID-19 as our research object and propose a hierarchical modeling framework for epidemic transmission, which describes how to decouple and dock domain models and computational models. This framework consists of three levels: individual capability model and virus model at the individual level, organizational structure and interaction mechanisms between individuals at the organizational level, and intervention model and environmental model design at the social level. The experimental results show that this is an effective hierarchical framework modeling approach for studying transmission mechanisms.},

The software quality evaluation has a significant effect on the entire project. However, for software quality evaluation a number of techniques are available. Most of the models are based on the characteristics of software and relevant scores. But consideration and evaluation of software on all the quality characteristics are time is taken and complex, which is not suitable for all kinds of projects. Therefore, in order to reduce the software quality assessment effort, this paper proposes a categorization of essential quality characteristics based on software project needs. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization Process is proposed for recommending the suitable software quality evaluation attributes. The simulation of the model has been carried out and their performance analysis has been done. Based on the experimental analysis the results are presented and the future scope of the proposed work is explained.},

  abstract     = {Choosing the right system architecture for the problem at hand is challenging due to the large design space and high uncertainty in the early stage of the design process. Formulating the architecting process as an optimization problem may mitigate some of these challenges. This work investigates strategies for solving system architecture optimization (SAO) problems: expensive, black-box, hierarchical, mixed-discrete, constrained, multi-objective problems that may be subject to hidden constraints. Imputation ratio, correction ratio, correction fraction, and max rate diversity metrics are defined for characterizing hierarchical design spaces. This work considers two classes of optimization algorithms for SAO: multi-objective evolutionary algorithms such as NSGA-II, and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms. A new Gaussian process kernel is presented that enables modeling hierarchical categorical variables, extending previous work on modeling continuous and integer hierarchical variables. Next, a hierarchical sampling algorithm that uses design space hierarchy to group design vectors by active design variables is developed. Then, it is demonstrated that integrating more hierarchy information in the optimization algorithms yields better optimization results for BO algorithms. Several realistic single-objective and multi-objective test problems are used for investigations. Finally, the BO algorithm is applied to a jet engine architecture optimization problem. This work shows that the developed BO algorithm can effectively solve the problem with one order of magnitude less function evaluations than NSGA-II. The algorithms and problems used in this work are implemented in the open-source Python library SBArchOpt .},

  abstract     = {Decision support systems (DSS) are used daily to make complex and hard decisions. Developing a DSS is not an easy task and may require combining different approaches to reach accurate and timely responses. In this paper, we present a DSS based on a micro-service architecture that we developed to handle a variant of the vehicle routing problem. The DSS has been implemented for a service company operating in the field of pharmaceutical distribution, and it helps decision-makers define the routes that different types of vehicles need to perform during the day to serve the customers’ demands. The underlying optimization problem assumes that a vehicle can perform multiple routes daily and is constrained to operate within a given time horizon. Customers are characterized by hard time windows on the delivery times. The proposed DSS first handles geo-referencing and distance calculation tasks. Then, it invokes a two-step optimization approach in which vehicle routes are generated and combined to reduce the number of vehicles used. For the latter task, we propose and evaluate four solution methods: two greedy heuristics, a metaheuristic, and a mathematical model. All the methods are applied to solve real and randomly generated instances, showing that the metaheuristic algorithm is superior to the others in terms of solution quality and computing time. The company had a very positive feedback on the proposed DSS and is now using it to support its daily operations.},

  abstract     = {In order to enhance the accuracy and productivity of CNC machine tools, the finite element method (FEM) is utilized for analyzing machining operations and machine tool structures. Through this approach, it becomes possible to assess and reduce machining errors, thereby improving the precision of machined parts. Additionally, by subjecting machine tool components to the analysis of stress and deformations under real operating conditions, the overall performance and lifespan of the machine tool structures can be augmented. This study focuses on the implementation of finite element methods for the analysis and optimization of CNC machine tool operations and structure. In this study, a virtual model of the Good Way CNC turning machine was used to study the machine’s behavior. The first three vibrational modes analyzed through a modal analysis were 108.2 Hz, 133.4 Hz, and 191.7 Hz, which were experimentally validated using modal tests. The design precision was supported by the harmonic response. For an applied external load of 500 N on the head chuck, the tool turret's transient response was established through transient analysis at 0.4 s. However, after the static analysis, the maximum deformation of the machine at the same external applied load on the tool turret was upheld at 7.6 μm. The spatial position analysis rectified the modal performance of the machine at a variety of set working positions. As the principal cause of rigidity originates from the base of the machine, three sets of ground support combinations were claimed to test the machine's rigidity. After the topology optimization analysis was achieved, a better-optimized version of the design was suggested. The old and new models were compared, and an increase of 1.5},

Potentially, the optimization problem in the RFM is more difficult to solve than those that arise in traditional methods. Unlike the broader machine-learning research, which frequently targets tasks within the low-precision regime, our study focuses on the high-precision regime crucial for solving PDEs. In this work, we study this problem from the following aspects: (i) we analyze the coefficient matrix that arises in the RFM by studying the distribution of singular values; (ii) we investigate whether the continuous training causes the overfitting issue; (iii) we test direct and iterative methods as well as randomized methods for solving the optimization problem. Based on these results, we find that direct methods are superior to other methods if memory is not an issue, while iterative methods typically have low accuracy and can be improved by preconditioning to some extent.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a variable-fidelity constrained lower confidence bound (VF-CLCB) criterion is presented for computationally expensive constrained optimization problems (COPs) with two levels of fidelity. In VF-CLCB, the hierarchical Kriging model is adopted to model the objective and inequality constraints. Two infill sampling functions are developed based on the objective and the constraints, respectively, and an adaptive selection strategy is set to select the elite sample points. Moreover, based on the VF-CLCB criterion, a parallel optimization method noted as PVF-CLCB is subsequently developed to accelerate the optimization process. In PVF-CLCB, a VF influence function is defined to approximately evaluate the estimation error of the hierarchical Kriging models, based on which multiple promising points can be determined at each iteration. In addition, an allocation strategy is proposed to distribute the computation resources between the objective- and constraint-oriented functions properly. Lastly, the proposed VF-CLCB and PVF-CLCB approaches are compared with the alternative methods on 12 benchmark numerical cases, and their significant superiority in solving computationally expensive COPs is verified. Furthermore, the proposed methods are employed to optimize the global stability of the stiffened cylindrical shell, and the optimum structure is yielded.},

  abstract     = {In motorsport applications the adoption of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is a well-established practice. This analysis is very useful to understand and optimize the aerodynamics performance of the prototypes. By means of specific algorithms it’s possible to define one or more control parameters and so changing the geometry of the fairing to optimize an engineering value. These algorithms are largely used in other fields such as the hydrodynamics one but they are not largely used in motorsport, especially in motorcycles. The motorcycle considered in this study is a prototype participating in the Moto2 World Championship, the middle class of the MotoGP World Championship. Starting from tests, carried out in the wind tunnel, a baseline model was firstly created to get a correlation between experimental and numerical results and so used for a subsequent process of shape optimization. With the main objective of reducing the overall drag, a set of control points was defined on the existing geometry to deform the surface of the front fairing. These points have been used by the optimization algorithm to find the shape that reduces the overall drag. The optimized geometry made it possible to obtain the desired drag reduction.},

First, we use ergodic theory and extreme value theory to reformulate the original constraints into time-independent ones. We obtain an equivalent RBDO problem for which classical algorithms perform poorly. The second step of the procedure is to solve the reformulated problem with a new method introduced in this paper and based on an adaptive kriging strategy well suited to the reformulated constraints called AK-ECO for adaptive kriging for expectation constraints optimization. The procedure is applied to two toy examples involving a harmonic oscillator subjected to random forces. It is then applied to an optimal design problem for a floating offshore wind turbine.},

The response surface approach uses data from finite element analysis to fit a polynomial model between objectives and factors. The particle swarm optimization with constrict factor ( PSOCF ) algorithm is used for determining the Pareto frontier. In the Taguchi method, the effects of the noise factors on the optimization objective are considered. The combinations of significant factor levels for different objectives obtained from orthogonal experiments were fused into an optimal combination based on the influence proportion of factors. In the improved Taguchi method, the optimization objectives are fused into multiple performance characteristic indexes ( MPCI ) based on fuzzy inference. The MPCI is optimized by the Taguchi method. Then the sequential experiments are used to increase the range and effectiveness of the optimization. The characteristics and the optimization results of the three methods were compared and the improved Taguchi method was verified based on a test of the prototype motor.},

The results indicated that the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, whose hyper-parameters were optimized by a genetic algorithm, can accurately predicted the compressive strength of the slurries. The impact of the variables on development of compressive strength can explain the internal reaction mechanisms.

The sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) approach using the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm (SORACG) is proposed to decouple the RBTO procedure into sequential deterministic topology optimization (DTO) loops and reliability assessment (RA) loops. The computational efficiency and solution accuracy are enhanced benefiting from the decoupling feature of SORA. A popular fail-safe model simulating the local material failure using damaged zones with prescribed shape and size is introduced into DTO. Non-differentiable fail-safe worst-case problem is transformed into an equivalent bound formulation via the 
$$\beta$$
 β -method. Combing the three-stage continuation technique (3SCT) which considers both iterative efficiency and global optimality, a multi-model optimization strategy is suggested to address the fail-safe model. In RA, the CG algorithm is developed to derive the most probable point (MPP) for the optimal fail-safe DTO design. Numerical cases concerning a cantilever beam and engineering applications for a long-span open deck and 10,000-ton container ship demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.},

To tackle the challenge of optimizing automotive seats, this paper presents a detailed optimization design method. In detail, the finite element models firstly established and validated through eight typical working conditions of automotive seats based on experimental data. Then, the optimized variables are screened and determined through contribution analysis, in which, the various perspectives are taken into account, such as the total cost and mass of seat materials, safety performance, and comfort index. Subsequently, an optimization strategy is constructed, which combines optimal Latin hypercube sampling, response surface method surrogate models, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, entropy weighting method, gray relational analysis, and Visekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje method for the optimal design of the automotive seat frame. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis of the optimal trade-off solution is carried out in terms of both decision methods and optimization strategies. The results show that ensuring the safety performance, the total cost, and total mass of the seat frame material decreased by 17.22},

To explore its fullest machining potential, it is always required to operate the micro-EDM process while setting its various input parameters at their optimal levels. In this paper, four popular multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, in the form of weighted aggregated sum product assessment, technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, combinative distance-based assessment and complex proportional assessment are separately hybridized with teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm to solve the parametric optimization problems of a micro-EDM process. The polynomial regression (PR) models are considered here as the inputs to these hybrid optimizers. Their optimization performance is subsequently validated against the conventionally adopted weighted sum multi-objective optimization (WSMO) approach at four different weight scenarios. It is revealed that for the micro-EDM process, all the MCDM-PR-TLBO approaches provide better solutions as compared to PR-WSMO-TLBO method for the considered weight scenarios.

Only their ranges of variations are known to an engineer. Hence, these parameters can be more rationally modeled as uncertain-but-bounded (UBB). Though, there is significant attention on RDO of structures with UBB parameters under static load, study of UBB-based RDO under uncertain dynamic load is scarce. Also, usual convex hyper-ellipsoidal programming-based RDO for UBB parameters cannot be readily applied to the present problem due to unavailability of explicit functional form of constraints. Another issue is the record-to-record variations of wind load time-histories, which are generally observed even for the same set-up of characterizing parameters. To circumvent these problems, the present study proposes a dual response surface method (RSM)-based RDO procedure using convex programming, which generates explicit functional forms of mean and standard deviation of the constraints, and considers record-to-record variation of wind load, as well. By virtue of dual RSM, the method becomes computationally efficient, as well. The RDO results obtained by the proposed approach are observed to track robust and economic solution. The results are compared with the conventional RDO approach to establish its improvements over the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithms have become widely used for solving complex optimization problems. However, their effectiveness in real-world applications is often limited by the need for many evaluations, which can be both costly and time-consuming. This is especially true for large-scale transportation networks, where the size of the problem and the high computational cost can hinder the algorithm’s performance. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on using surrogate-assisted models. These models aim to reduce the number of expensive evaluations and improve the efficiency of solving time-consuming optimization problems. This paper presents a new two-layer Surrogate-Assisted Fish Migration Optimization (SA-FMO) algorithm designed to tackle high-dimensional and computationally heavy problems. The global surrogate model offers a good approximation of the entire problem space, while the local surrogate model focuses on refining the solution near the current best option, improving local optimization. To test the effectiveness of the SA-FMO algorithm, we first conduct experiments using six benchmark functions in a 50-dimensional space. We then apply the algorithm to optimize urban rail transit routes, focusing on the Train Routing Optimization problem. This aims to improve operational efficiency and vehicle turnover in situations with uneven passenger flow during transit disruptions. The results show that SA-FMO can effectively improve optimization outcomes in complex transportation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In this research, a modification of the Harris hawk optimization (HHO) is introduced and applied to feature selection. The proposed HHO variant is termed as hybrid multi-leader HHO with differential evolution (MLHHDE). To help hawks overcome the situation of falling into local optimum during the searching process, an improved memory structure is introduced, which makes the hawks learn simultaneously from the historical best and global best positions. Besides, the multi-leader mechanism is also introduced to make full use of the valuable information from global best memories (leaders), enhance the diversity of hawks’ search mode, and improve the hawks’ exploration capability. Furthermore, differential evolution operations are integrated into HHO to further improve the weak exploration phase. Our proposed MLHHDE algorithm integrates a V-shaped transfer function, which can convert continuous solutions to binary solutions. To validate the modification of MLHHDE, we compared its performance with the advanced optimization algorithms through three experiments. In the first experiment, the performance of MLHHDE to solve a set of problems from the CEC 2017 benchmark is evaluated. Meanwhile, the second experiment aims to apply the binary version of MLHHDE to tackle the feature selection task by applying it to a set of sixteen datasets from the UCI repository. In the third, we applied the proposed model as a quantitative structure-activity relationship method to predict the influenza viruses H1N1 as a real-world application. The performance of the proposed MLHHDE is assessed using a number of evaluation indicators. The experiment results prove the powerful capability of MLHHDE to find the optimal solution in the two experiments as well as it outperforms other methods (i.e., either global optimization or feature selection). In addition, the developed MLHHDE provides accuracy overall the UCI datasets nearly 84},

  abstract     = {Selective laser melting (SLM) has increasingly been adopted to produce titanium alloy components across various industries. However, a significant challenge associated with SLM is the high surface roughness of the resulting parts. To address this issue and enhance the mechanical and tribological properties of titanium, silicon carbide (SiC) particles are incorporated into the titanium matrix, resulting in the formation of Ti-SiC composites. The addition of SiC significantly improves the hardness, wear resistance, and overall performance of the material. This study presents a novel optimization framework for fabricating Ti-SiC composites via SLM, focusing on the influence of critical process parameters, including laser power, scanning speed, and SiC content. A full factorial design analysis, combined with empirical modeling and an analysis of variance, was conducted using response surface methodology to evaluate the relationships between these variables. To further refine the optimization, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, employing a crowding distance approach, was implemented. The optimal solutions were subsequently ranked using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation and selection of the best outcomes, which yielded favorable mechanical properties in the materials. This research provides valuable insights into the optimization of SLM processes for Ti-SiC composites, with practical implications for industries such as automotive and aerospace, where high-performance titanium alloy components are essential.},

  abstract     = {The presented work suggests a robust approach for skin lesion segmentation in the state of the art of optimized active contours and level sets according to the estimation of both restriction and energy forces. The proposed system would separate accurately the interest region by defining the appropriate contour or curvature. Accordingly, the following optimizers have been utilized and tested; particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), bee colony optimization (BCO), and interior-point optimization (IPO) for optimizing the suggested trigonometric regularization functions. Experimental findings have recommended the use of the proposed Sine-IPO algorithm which targeting the best-segmentation of different types of skin lesions in dermoscopy images. In addition, different performance metrics have been utilized; true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false-negative (FN) in order to guarantee the appropriate segmentation accuracy. The results depicted the superiority of using IPO based Sine function with accuracy (about 96.23},

  abstract     = {Closed-die forging preforms are usually made by open die forging operations, which are subject to significant variabilities. A sensitivity study covering a wide range of influencing parameters has highlighted the predominant influence of the initial billet geometry. The forging die strokes were also highly influential, while their fidelity is sufficient to use them as control parameters in order to compensate the geometrical dispersions of the billet. Consequently, their optimization was performed by taking a nominal preform geometry as the target. Polynomial surrogate models have been constructed to enable real-time optimization. A specific preform was used as a demonstrator in this study, while the approach was generic. The surrogate models were built using data from finite element simulations, which were first validated with an experimental campaign. On the one hand, this approach introduced agility by allowing changes in the billet geometry, and on the other hand, it allowed individual customization of the specific route to each billet.},

To mitigate the interface blurring effect caused by the dissipation of convective terms, this study first introduces an artificial convective term into the phase control equation to enhance the numerical discretization accuracy and stability. The numerical simulation considering cavitation phase transition effects is implemented based on the OpenFOAM platform; next, a GPR surrogate model for the inducer cavitation performance is constructed using a full-factorial experimental design method. The global sensitivity of the inducer's structural parameters and the mechanism of their interaction effects are revealed, and the numerical errors of the surrogate model are quantified; finally, particle swarm optimization is employed to optimize the design of the inducer component, and the global convergence of results is verified based on the expected improvement function used in Bayesian optimization. Results show that the cavitation number obtained through simulation is 0.052, with an error of only 3.6},

  abstract     = {Several metamodeling techniques and strategies have been developed in recent decades for assisting the global optimization process of costly functions. These have been applied in two ways mainly: through the construction of a unique metamodel that is used as the objective function inside the optimization algorithm; or through the sequential metamodel, construction used to assist the domain exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. The multiquadric and Gaussian radial basis functions contain a shape parameter, which affects the metamodel accuracy and the convergence of the metamodels based optimization algorithms. The use of a simple and efficient algorithm to automatically adjust the shape parameter inside these algorithms is proposed in the present article to increase the robustness of sequential metamodel assisted optimization algorithms. The technique is applied in the context of a specific algorithm of such kind for which the shape parameter adjustment was not apparently investigated yet. Comparative numerical results for benchmark functions and a real engineering problem about blade cascade design optimization are presented and discussed. The results attest that the proposed technique can produce optimization process accelerations comparable to those obtained using fixed shape parameters previously optimized.},

These algorithms possess unique features for solving optimization problems and are usually developed on the basis of real-world natural phenomena or animal and insect behavior. Numerous fields have benefited from metaheuristic algorithms for solving real-world optimization problems. As a renewable energy source, offshore wind energy is a rapidly developing subject of research, attracting considerable interest worldwide. However, designing offshore wind turbine systems can be challenging because of the large space of design parameters and different environmental conditions, and the optimization of offshore wind turbines can be extremely expensive. Nevertheless, advanced optimization methods can help to overcome these challenges. This study explores the use of metaheuristic algorithms in optimizing the design of wind turbines, including wind farm layout and wind turbine blades. Given that offshore wind energy relies more heavily on subsidies than fossil fuel-based energy sources, lowering the costs for future projects, particularly by developing new technologies and optimizing existing methods, is crucial.},

A dual-layer optimization strategy for active distribution networks considering the Multi-port Storage-embedded SOP is explored. A dual-layer planning model for active distribution networks with a three-port Storage-embedded SOP is established and solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Cone Programming algorithm. Finally, on an enhanced IEEE 33-bus system, four scenarios were created based on different connection locations of the Multi-port Storage-embedded SOP to conduct a comparative analysis of the dual-layer optimization strategy. The simulation results indicate that optimizing the capacity configuration of SOP and storage provides reasonable capacity allocation for different operational scenarios, preventing resource wastage during the investment and construction process. This optimization leads to a further reduction in the overall active power loss within the system, consequently enhancing the economic efficiency of both operational activities and planning processes in active distribution networks.},

  abstract     = {The essence of optimization design of a multi-stage axial flow compressor is to solve an expensive black-box multi-objective problem. The multi-objective efficient global optimization has been demonstrated as a promising alternative to solve such expensive multi-objective problems. It sequentially samples the design space to seek for the Pareto solutions with a minimum number of sample points. With access to parallel computation, it is wise to add multiple infill points per optimization iteration to make optimization parallelizable to shorten the total design process further. In this paper, the parallel version of the expected improvement of modified hypervolume (EIMHV) criterion is developed following the multiple good local optima strategy. An empirical parameter-free exclusion radius function is proposed and combined with the EIMHV criterion to easy the search of the multiple local optima. The proposed method is used to solve analytic benchmark problems firstly. It is found that the parallel method with moderate number of infill points could achieve significant speedup without noteworthy sacrifice to the optimization gain. While, parallel method with a large number of infill points cannot provide further acceleration to the optimal search but deteriorate the optimization performance. By incorporating an efficient Kriging modeling method for high-dimension problem and the imputation strategy to deal with simulation failures to the proposed method, the optimization design of a 3-stage axial flow compressor with 2 objectives and 144 design variables is solved. Significant improved objective values and convergence speed demonstrated the engineering practicality of the proposed method.},

Free-form deformation was used to improve the optimisation efficiency without remodelling or remeshing. The sample points and their responses were obtained via optimal Latin hypercube sampling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The hybrid surrogate model (HSM) was constructed by using the theory of optimal weighted surrogate to combine a polynomial response surface (PRS) model with a radial basis function (RBF) model. Comprehensive error evaluation results indicated that the prediction accuracy achieved with the HSM was higher than that achieved with either the PRS model or the RBF model; thus, the HSM was selected for use in each iteration to approximate the CFD simulation model of the high-speed train in subsequent optimisation. Then, the CMOPSO algorithm was selected as the optimisation algorithm. After optimisation, a series of Pareto-optimal solutions was obtained, and the optimal and original head shapes were compared. The use of the hybrid surrogate model and the CMOPSO algorithm greatly improved the optimisation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel adaptable framework for multi-objective optimization (MOO) in metal additive manufacturing (AM). The framework offers significant advantages by departing from the traditional design of experiments (DoE) and embracing surrogate-based optimization techniques for enhanced efficiency. It accommodates a wide range of process variables such as laser power, scan speed, hatch distance, and optimization objectives like porosity and surface roughness (SR), leveraging Bayesian optimization for continuous improvement. High-fidelity surrogate models are ensured through the implementation of space-filling design and Gaussian process regression. Sensitivity analysis (SA) is employed to quantify the influence of input parameters, while an evolutionary algorithm drives the MOO process. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by applying it to optimize SR and porosity in a case study, achieving a significant reduction in SR and porosity levels using data from existing literature. The Gaussian process model achieves a commendable cross-validation R 2 score of 0.79, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values with minimal relative mean errors. Furthermore, the SA highlights the dominant role of hatch spacing in SR prediction and the balanced contribution of laser speed and power on porosity control. This adaptable framework offers significant potential to surpass existing optimization approaches by enabling a more comprehensive optimization, contributing to notable advancements in AM technology.},

For laminated composites structures, the key design parameters are material choice, fiber orientation, stacking sequence, and layer thickness, however a framework for treating these simultaneously in optimization, on the current wind turbine blade scale, has not been demonstrated. Thus, the motivation and novelty of the present work is providing and demonstrating a general gradient-based approach applicable to wind turbine blades, where the key design parameters and structural criteria, i.e., buckling, static strength, and fatigue damage, are considered for multiple design load cases. The optimization framework is based on a variation of the Discrete Material and Thickness Optimization approach, where the thickness is directly parametrized, allowing for appropriately treating the sandwich parts of the blade. It is demonstrated how optimization leads to a design consisting of complex variable-thickness laminates, a good overall distribution of the structural criteria in the model, and a significant reduction in mass compared to the initial design.},

Students and teachers benefit from expanded network connectivity via augmented engagement, more inclusivity, and efficient diffusion of information. We present a novel method for positively influencing the class social network. We develop an in-class grouping strategy based on optimization and sociocentric network analysis that pragmatically expands the students’ social networks. In contrast to existing routines, our technique focuses on maximizing individual student opportunities to establish new ties. Based on the knowledge of existing connections, our procedure systematically optimizes the overall number of new ties that can be established during a team project. Our data-driven approach is designed for practical use in class. We show that the underlying combinatorial problem of maximizing unrelated intra-team students can be modeled as a bin packing variant. Using an integer programming formulation, we demonstrate the efficient spreadsheet implementation. We discuss model extensions to account for high-density networks, team balancing, and teammate forcing and forbidding, allowing for hybridization using existing grouping techniques. In an empirical study, we provide evidence for the efficacy of our approach using data from 10 industrial engineering classes with 253 students and 77 project teams - in both face-to-face and virtual modes. We demonstrate the impact of our grouping method compared to random-assignment, self-selection, and maximizing existing intra-team ties. We report an impressive 62},

First, an VSNDI controller is proposed in the affine HMV. Then fuzzy approximation estimates the nonlinear parameters, where the iterative optimization strategy minimizes the estimation errors and makes the nonlinear parameters accurate enough to ensure the VSNDI’s effectiveness. Aiming at the combination disturbances formed by the approximation errors and external multi-disturbances, the variable structure adaptive law in each channel is proposed to adjust the amplitudes of the fuzzy free parameter weights, thence combining the independently designed fuzzy robust compensator to real-time suppress disturbances. The variable structure residual adaptive laws for cross-channel nonlinear matrices in VSNDI solve the coupling problem of the combined concurrent disturbances caused by sea-skimming flight. Finally, variable structure and fuzzy control scheme enable HMV to achieve accurate tracking under multi-mode and complex disturbances. The system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness of the method is proved by simulation experiment.},

  abstract     = {Electric shovel (ES) is a large mining equipment crucial for energy security. The traditional design of the structure and control system of ES is carried out in stages, and the influence of the structural uncertainty for the system is not considered, which makes it difficult to obtain the optimal parameters of the system. Facing the demand of intelligent development, ES designed using traditional deterministic methods is difficult to meet the working demand of unmanned mining electric shovel (UMES). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an uncertainty-based multidisciplinary multi-objective optimization (UMMO) framework for UMES. Within this framework, the mechanical structure of the front-end mechanism was analyzed, excavation trajectories were planned based on a polynomial point-to-point motion strategy, and models for the excavation resistance of the dipper and the dynamical model of the front-end working device were constructed. Then, optimization objective functions were constructed with excavation energy consumption, excavation efficiency, and full dipper rate as targets. By analyzing the working characteristics of UMES, essential constraints were introduced for the mechanical system, control system and hardware. The UMMO optimization model was established to enhance the reliability of the UMES production process. Finally, the mechanical structure dimensions and control system parameters are optimized to generate the optimal physical structure and excavation trajectory considering uncertainties. The numerical results show that compared with the deterministic optimization results, the optimized structure of the proposed UMMO strategy is more compact and the mechanical structure is more reliable in the production process.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity surrogate models fusing data from different fidelity systems can significantly reduce the computational cost while ensuring the model accuracy. The focus of this paper is on the sequential design for multi-fidelity models for expensive black-box problem. A Co-kriging-based multi-fidelity sequential optimization method named proportional expected improvement (PEI) is proposed with the objection to be more efficient for global optimization and to be more reasonable to evaluate the costs and benefits of candidate points from different levels of fidelity. The PEI method is an extension of expected improvement (EI) and uses an integrated criterion to determine both location and fidelity level of the subsequent. In the integrated criterion, a proportional factor which is adaptively adjusted according to the sample density is added in EI to adjust the tendency between exploration and exploitation during the search process. Meanwhile, Kullback–Leibler divergence is used to measure the credibility of a point from system with different fidelities, and the cost and constraint of different fidelities are also considered. The effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method were demonstrated by seven analytical functions and then applied to the aerodynamic shape optimization of NACA0012 airfoil. Experiments show that the proportional factor makes the proposed algorithm better search for the global optimum, and the KL divergence can describe the relationship between high and low fidelity more significantly.},

The proposed model is applied to a high-aspect-ratio flexible wing. Computational fluid and structural dynamic codes are loosely coupled and interact with the coupling variables of pressure and displacement. Level 1 reduces the coupling variables, using proper orthogonal decomposition, enabling the expansion of any data field as a linear combination of several modes. Level 2 builds the surrogate model, considering proper orthogonal displacement coefficients and the angle of attack as input parameters and the pressure coefficients as output parameters. Unlike the conventional bilevel surrogate model, the improved bilevel surrogate model includes the angle of attack as an input parameter to facilitate the immediate calculation of the trim angle of attack. The wing model of Global Hawk is optimized using the improved bilevel surrogate model, and the conventional bilevel surrogate model was used to compare the results of design optimization under two conditions: including and excluding the trim condition.},

  abstract     = {The blockages in gully systems increase the flood risk in urban areas because less surface water can be drained into the sewer pipes beneath. Since a gully system comprises three components of street inlets, gully channels, and lateral tubes, it has been challenging to study the cleaning strategies when multiple gully components are simultaneously blocked, especially when considering the complex interactions in hydraulics and optimization. In this study, we adopted a sophisticated hydraulic model to simulate water transportation across surface, gully, and sewer layers under 16 scenarios with different blockage ratios of gully components for a rainstorm event in 2017 in Taipei City, Taiwan. The results are regressed and served as objective functions in nonlinear programming to obtain optimal cleaning strategies for each gully component that minimize surface floodwater volumes under different frequencies and budgets. The regression results show that floodwater volumes increase the most with the blockage of gully channels compared to the blockages of other components; however, the optimization analysis indicates that street inlets should be cleaned first for having the lowest cost. Compared with the increase of budget, the increase of cleaning frequency is more cost-effective because it prevents the nonlinear increase of floodwater volume at high gully blockage ratios. This research provides a guideline for the cleaning of a gully system in which the blockages of different components must be removed in a sequential manner in order to minimize flood risk.},

  abstract     = {Civil defense projects, designed as wartime underground spaces, often lack effective natural ventilation and have considerable depth, which complicates their use as public spaces in peacetime. However, the application of passive ventilation technologies can create effective airflow channels within these structures, significantly enhancing ventilation efficiency and thus improving the overall thermal comfort level. For this study, air age, along with average wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity as stipulated by the “Requirements for Environmental Sanitation of Civil Air Defense Works during Peacetime Use” (GBT 17216-2012), were selected as evaluation metrics. This paper compares the ventilation effectiveness between single ventilation shafts and multiple ventilation shafts under positive and negative pressure conditions in underground civil defense structures. The results indicate that negative pressure ventilation in multiple shaft configurations performs optimally across various ventilation approaches. Subsequently, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was utilized to further optimize the positioning of multiple ventilation shafts. The study examined the impact of three ventilation shaft locations on average wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and air age, leading to an optimized design. Specifically, the optimal positions are 54.76 m for Shaft A, 51.45 m for Shaft B, and 79.85 m for Shaft C, achieving an average wind speed of 0.222 m/s, a temperature of 26 °C, a relative humidity reduction to 85.47},

The result of integrated process planning and scheduling is visually presented in the form of the Gantt chart that summarizes the timing and order of all manufacturing operations. Moreover, a sequence of actions that needs to be performed by a transportation system to ensure the smooth execution of all manufacturing processes is also incorporated within the Gantt chart. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a framework for mobile robot action planning based on high-level action, e.g., transporting the part from one machine to another. The idea is to automatically plan a sequence of robot-performable actions that, if performed accurately, results in achieving a high-level goal. The framework is developed in the standard Robot Operative System 2 (ROS2) middleware. The system, domain, and essential entities are modeled by using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). The mobile robot actions are modeled by Behavior trees within the PlanSys2 framework. Even though the system for task planning is developed for a manufacturing environment, the framework can be used in various fields such as service or medical mobile robotics applications where scheduling activity is of the essence.},

Metaheuristic algorithms have gained enormous attention in the last decade to solve complex multi-modal optimization problems. Hybridization of metaheuristics is an interesting and fruitful research area as it improves performance capabilities of the existing algorithms. In this paper, a novel hybridized multi-objective optimization approach called TOPSIS-PR-GWO is introduced by combining a popular multi-criteria decision-making technique called TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) with grey wolf optimizer (GWO) for parametric optimization of an abrasive jet machining process. The polynomial regression (PR) metamodels are treated as the inputs to this hybrid optimizer. The performance of TOPSIS-PR-GWO is validated against the conventionally adopted weighted sum multi-objective optimization (WSMO) approach, and it is revealed that for the considered machining process, TOPSIS-PR-GWO provides 2 to 321},

  abstract     = {An octagonal plan-shaped principal building is subjected to boundary layer wind flow in the presence of three square plan-shaped interfering buildings. A thorough numerical investigation by computational fluid dynamics is conducted to find out the interference effects on the octagonal building for 0°, 30° and 330° wind incidence angles. Different metamodels of interference factors (IF) are derived for the different faces of the building under different wind incidence angles. Interference factors determined using the metamodels are applied for calculating the interference factor for different interference cases. Response Surface Method is employed to establish the metamodels in terms of distances between buildings. These metamodels are optimised to create upstream interference zones for different wind incidence angles. The uncertainty principle is employed in the optimisation technique to incorporate the uncertain nature of the wind flow. Power spectral densities (PSD) of selected cases are presented to show the dynamic effect of wind in isolated as well as interfering cases. A notable difference in peak PSD is observed between PSDs for different wind incidence angles and in interference condition. The generated metamodels can be used to find out the interference factors for different faces of the principal buildings. This interference factors, in turn, can be used to find out the pressure coefficients for the faces at various interfering conditions without having to analyse each of the cases. The interference zone is a boundary marker for pointing out the region around the principal building inside which the interfering buildings affect wind-induced responses of the principal building. The difference in pressure spectra between isolated and interfering case is primarily observed in a higher frequency range which highlights the local disturbances on the principal building in those interfering conditions. This phenomenon has to be considered while designing the building in said interference condition.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous machines promise more flexibility and robustness changes in their environment compared to manually programmed solutions in industrial applications. However, the autonomous planning of actions involves discrete as well as continuous properties, which results in a np-hard planning problem. Especially for multiple machines and long planning horizons the design of domains requires a lot of fine tuning and thus manual effort. Modularization and reuse of existing domain knowledge with formalized models is one solution to this issue. However, the models of different projects tend to be misaligned, in particular when several parties contributed to the project, which deteriorates the performance. In this paper, we present two domain optimization and extension algorithms, which adapt the models to facilitate planning. The first algorithm handles inconsistent units, or even misaligned pieces of sub-information. It automatically generates conversions and allows to call operations with a wider range of input types. The second algorithm aligns models from different sources with varying modeling views. After this reformulation, we can compose models more efficiently to a larger domain. For both optimizations, we rely on the formal set-based models that we also use in our previously presented hierarchical planning algorithm. Our hierarchical approach allows an almost linear scalability with the length of the plan. However, it comes with non-optimality effects due to the imposed intermediate goals that depend on the quality of the model. The optimization algorithms of this paper allow to adapt and extend the model so that valid shortcuts reduce these suboptimalities. We conduct experiments on a task and motion assembly problem, demonstrating scalability for up to 62 parts and plans with over 1000 steps, which either result in discrete state or high-level position changes, with planning times of less than 15 min. Our experiments also include the successful plan execution on a real-world dual arm setup.},

  abstract     = {Engineering systems often encounter inherent uncertain parameters during their design phase and throughout their service life. This leads systems to deviate from their intended performance, which results in catastrophic failures, including fatalities and significant capital loss. To address the increasing need for safer and more resilient systems that are less susceptible to uncertainties, this paper presents a novel framework aimed at ensuring both reliability and robustness. The methodology introduces a two-stage decoupled probabilistic framework for reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO). Handling both stochastic constraints (failure probability) and a stochastic objective function (robustness measures) simultaneously in RBRDO has proven to be significantly challenging, often aggravating the accuracy and efficiency of the design algorithms in the literature. To obviate these difficulties, the proposed framework, utilizing a simulation-based approach, is the first-of-its-kind. It decouples stochastic constraints from the stochastic objective functions within the optimization loop by first iteratively identifying a feasible design space that meets reliability constraints. Subsequently, it optimizes the robustness measures—specifically, the mean and variance within the identified feasible design space. Here, “ augmented formulation ” is defined for both robustness measures (mean and variance) and reliability constraints. Voronoi tessellation is used for design space exploration and exploitation, while the optimization is carried out using a simulation-based stochastic optimization method, namely “ Improved Stochastic Subset Optimization (iSSO) . ” Benchmark case studies investigated complex linear and nonlinear four- and ten-bar trusses, a transmission tower truss structure, and a base-isolated structure. The proposed framework is observed to have higher accuracy and lower computational demand in comparison to existing literature.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has become popular among individuals and enterprises due to its convenience, scalability, and flexibility. However, a major concern for many cloud service users is the rising cost of cloud resources. Since cloud computing uses a pay-per-use model, costs can add up quickly, and unexpected expenses can arise from a lack of visibility and control. The cost structure gets even more complicated when working with multi-cloud or hybrid environments. Businesses may spend much of their IT budget on cloud computing, and any savings can improve their competitiveness and financial stability. Hence, an efficient cloud cost management is crucial. To overcome this difficulty, new approaches and tools are being developed to provide greater oversight and command over cloud a graph-based approach for modelling cost elements and cloud resources and a potential way to solve the resulting constraint problem of cost optimisation. In this context, we primarily consider utilisation, cost, performance, and availability. The proposed approach is evaluated on three different user scenarios, and results indicate that it could be effective in cost modelling, cost optimisation, and scalability. This approach will eventually help organisations make informed decisions about cloud resource placement and manage the costs of software applications and data workflows deployed in single, hybrid, or multi-cloud environments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new method for auto-tuning an aircraft maneuvering controller using black-box optimization. Assuming that we do not have a deep understanding of the complex nature and behavior of the controlled aircraft model, we propose a data-efficient Proportional Integral Derivatives (PID) tuning method with explorations on the aircraft responses from the sampled control inputs. More specifically, we utilize Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian process (GP) to create a black-box model of the aircraft response corresponding to the sampled control parameters. We tested the feasibility and performance of the proposed data-driven tuning method with a six degrees of freedom (6DoF) nonlinear aircraft model. We also experimented with various GP kernel structures and hyperparameters to find the most suitable kernel function. Compared to the conventional tuning method, our proposed method shows shorter flight time and smaller deviations from the waypoints. The proposed data-driven tuning method can be an alternative to traditional model-based or model-free tuning methods, especially when the objective functions are expensive to evaluate and only a small number of experiments are available.},

However, this progress has also given rise to challenges, such as the depletion of chemical resources and the escalating impact of climate change. As a result, automobile companies are now prioritizing energy efficiency and transitioning towards eco-friendly vehicles. In response to this demand, various efforts have been made to harvest energy and improve the efficiency of eco-friendly vehicles, with energy-harvesting dampers emerging as a promising solution. This study focuses on the optimization of the shape and design of a rotary power generation system integrated within an energy harvesting system. The primary objective of the rotary power generation system is to convert mechanical motion into electrical energy, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and sustainability of eco-friendly vehicles. By considering the specific characteristics of SAE 30 W working oil within the damper, the optimal blade shape and generator can be determined to maximize the power generation capabilities of the system.},

We discuss the choice of objective function, the use of a convex optimization technique called geometric programming, and the level of modeling fidelity that has allowed us to capture the system’s many intertwined, and often recursive, design relationships.

  abstract     = {Rapid heat cycle molding (RHCM) that actively controls the mold temperature is an innovative plastic injection molding (PIM) technology. The melt plastic smoothly flows into cavity due to the high mold temperature, and weldline reduction can be achieved. The overall mold heating in the conventional RHCM leads to long cooling time, which makes the cycle time long. To shorten the cycle time as well as weldline reduction, the RHCM using a heater called the heater-assisted RHCM is developed. It is easy to install the heater in the mold, and the local region around which the weldline is observed is heated up. Consequently, the weldline will be reduced. Since the mold is locally heated up, short cycle time will be expected. Since the process parameters in the heater-assisted RHCM are unknown in advance, design optimization is used to determine the process parameters. The numerical simulation is computationally so expensive that sequential approximate optimization that response surface is repeatedly constructed and optimized is adopted to determine the optimal process parameters. It is found from the numerical result that the weldline and the cycle time are well reduced. Based on the numerical result, the experiment using the PIM machine (MS100, Sodick) is conducted. It is confirmed through the numerical and experimental result that the heater-assisted RHCM is effective to the weldline reduction and the short cycle time.},

EGO is a popular type of algorithm that is closely related to“Bayesian optimization” and“active machine learning”, as they all use Gaussian processes or Kriging to approximate the input/output behavior of black-box models. We numerically compare the performance of our KKT-EGO algorithm and two alternative EGO algorithms, in several popular examples.

  abstract     = {A multi-fidelity optimisation strategy has been developed in the present work, and its performance is illustrated through a series of test cases. The strategy is based on hybrid methods such that two genetic optimisation algorithms are employed, each coupled to a different fidelity level with transfer of information between them. The aim is that the low fidelity model, being less accurate but with a lower computational cost, performs a comprehensive search along the design space guiding the high fidelity model to the optimum region. This strategy has been shown to reduce the computational time of an optimisation through analytical test cases as well as numerical cases. The analytical cases have been used to tune the parameters that define the multi-fidelity strategy, while the numerical cases are employed to apply the method to engineering problems, focusing on the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil. The speed-up shows a certain dependency to the models relation, both regarding their similarity level as well as the relative computational cost. For cases exhibiting a significant dissimilarity between models, wherein the low fidelity model is notably inaccurate, the attained speed-up diminishes, and numerous instances demonstrate an absence of speed-up. However, for most cases, even with poor model similarity the optimisations are accelerated by an order of 2, while values up to 3–5 were found for higher similarity levels. Hence, the developed strategy shows a relevant decrease of computational cost of an optimisation procedure although its performance is affected by the models relative accuracy.},

To satisfy these objectives, there is a minimum pressure required for each WDS. In addition, to supply safe water, the World Health Organization has stipulated that residual chlorine standards should be maintained at 0.2–5.0 mg/L. However, the change in residence time, pressure, and flow rate can affect the design factor depending on the usage pattern. Even if the network size of WDS is similar, the shape of WDS affects hydraulic and water quality characteristics, such as not meeting the minimum pressure required by WDS. Therefore, in this study, branched type, hybrid type, and looped type were classified to consider the types and size of WDS. The objective functions applied the maximum system resilience and the minimum design cost. The optimal solution compared with the optimal design considering only pressure as the constraint and the optimal design considering the pressure and residual chlorine concentration simultaneously. The derived optimal design will meet the system’s resilience and the economic, water quality, hydraulic aspects, and it will increase the usability of customers.},

  abstract     = {The employment of numerical optimization techniques for parameter tuning of microwave components has nowadays become a commonplace. In pursuit of reliability, it is most often carried out at the level of full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, incurring considerable computational expenses. In the case of miniaturized microstrip circuits, densely arranged layouts with strong cross-coupling effects make EM-driven tuning imperative to achieve the optimum performance. The process is even more challenging due to a typically large number of geometry parameters, and the lack of reasonable initial designs. The latter often encourages the use of global search procedures, which may be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, a novel automated framework for reliable optimization of miniaturized microwave components is proposed. Our methodology is based on design specification management, where the performance requirements imposed on the system are temporarily relaxed if the current design is unlikely to be improved (e.g., due to being away from the target operating frequency). The specifications are re-adjusted at each iteration of the algorithm, and eventually converge to their original values. Using two examples of compact microstrip couplers and a power divider, the presented technique is demonstrated to significantly improve the efficacy of local search routines under challenging design scenarios.},

Our approach uses surrogates constructed based on response features, smoothing the objective function landscape processed by the algorithm. We begin with initial parameter space screening and surrogate model construction using coarse-discretization EM analysis. Subsequently, the surrogate evolves iteratively into a co-kriging model, refining itself using accumulated high-fidelity EM simulation results, with the infill criterion focusing on minimizing the predicted objective function. Employing a particle swarm optimizer (PSO) as the underlying search routine, extensive verification case studies showcase the efficiency and superiority of our procedure over benchmarks. The average optimization cost translates to just around ninety high-fidelity EM antenna analyses, showcasing excellent solution repeatability.

  abstract     = {Earth observation satellites (EOS) are satellites equipped with optical sensors that orbit the Earth to take photographs of particular areas at the request of users. With the development of space technology, the number of satellites has increased continuously. Yet still, the number of satellites cannot meet the explosive growth of applications. Thus, scheduling solutions are required to satisfy requests and obtain high observation efficiency. While the literature on multi-satellite scheduling is rich, most solutions are centralized algorithms. However, due to their cost, EOS systems are often co-funded by several agents (e.g., countries, companies, or research institutes). Central solutions require that these agents share their requests for observations with others. To date, there has yet to be a solution for EOS scheduling that protects the private information of the interested parties. In this study, we model the EOS scheduling problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP). This modeling enables the generation of timetables for the satellites in a distributed manner without a priori sharing users’ private information with some central authority. For solving the resulting DCOP, we use and compare the results of two different local search algorithms—Distributed Stochastic Algorithm and Maximum Gain Message—which are known to produce efficient solutions in a timely manner. The modeling and solving of the resulting DCOP constitute our new solution method, which we term Distributed Satellite Timetable Solver ( DSTS ). Experimental evaluation reveals that the DSTS method provides solutions of higher quality than a commonly used centralized greedy algorithm and is comparable to an additional centralized algorithm that we propose.},

Carbon metabolism alone cannot achieve maximal accumulation of metabolites in production hosts, since an efficient production of target molecules requires energy and redox balance, in addition to carbon flow. The interplay between cofactor regeneration and heterologous production in photosynthetic microorganisms is not fully explored. To investigate the optimality of energy and redox metabolism, while overproducing alkenes—isobutene, isoprene, ethylene and 1-undecene, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we applied stoichiometric metabolic modelling. Our network-wide analysis indicates that the rate of NAD(P)H regeneration, rather than of ATP, controls ATP/NADPH ratio, and thereby bioproduction. The simulation also implies that energy and redox balance is interconnected with carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Furthermore, we show that an auxiliary pathway, composed of serine, one-carbon and glycine metabolism, supports cellular redox homeostasis and ATP cycling. The study revealed non-intuitive metabolic pathways required to enhance alkene production, which are mainly driven by a few key reactions carrying a high flux. We envision that the presented comparative in-silico metabolic analysis will guide the rational design of Synechocystis as a photobiological production platform of target chemicals.},

Thus, the image acquisition from the environmental condition is more complex and crucial, but it must be focused on getting the high spectral and spatial quality. The primary intent of this paper is to plan for the intelligent higher-order spectral analysis for recovering the images from the moving water surface. The three main phases of the proposed image recovery model are (a) image pre-processing, (b) lucky region selection, and (c) image recovery. Once the pre-processing of the image is carried out, the lucky region selection is performed by computing the dice coefficient method. As a modification to the existing methods, the proposed model adopts optimized bispectra to enhance the quality of the recovered image. A hybrid algorithm with Dragonfly-Colliding Body Optimization (D-CBO) is used for enhancing the bispectra method. The proposed model has been tested on distorted underwater images. From the experimental analysis, in terms of PSNR measure, the suggested D-CBO-bispectra gets better efficiency than other conventional models, in which D-CBO-bispectra is 10.7},

In this work, we consider Cr_2O_3/TiAlN coating for tooling in metal forming applications. A full factorial DOE consisting of 45 experimental runs with varying combinations of wear parameters (applied load, sliding velocity, and counterbody) to evaluate the wear characteristics (friction coefficient, surface roughness, wear mass loss, and hardness) of Cr_2O_3/TiAlN-coated surface was considered to ensure the robustness of the model. A novel methodology namely fuzzy integrated PSI (Preference selection index)-CODAS (Combinative Distance-based Assessment) method was proposed to analyze and rank the alternatives (or experiments). The results are further analyzed using comprehensive sensitivity analysis. A total of thirty scenarios are developed by changing the weight of each criteria using the fuzzy-PSI method to examine the effect of change in criteria weight on the ranking of alternatives. In addition to this, four different normalization methods and two criteria weight calculation methods are used to evaluate their effect on the ranking of the alternative. It is observed that alternative 42 (or E_42 having a load and sliding velocity, value of 10 N, 0.3 m/s, respectively, against steel ball counterbody) remains the best alternative for optimal wear responses in Cr_2O_3/TiAlN coating. The obtained result is also compared with the result obtained from five different fuzzy integrated MCDM methods.},

  abstract     = {In real-time systems, priorities assigned to real-time tasks determine the order of task executions, by relying on an underlying task scheduling policy. Assigning optimal priority values to tasks is critical to allow the tasks to complete their executions while maximizing safety margins from their specified deadlines. This enables real-time systems to tolerate unexpected overheads in task executions and still meet their deadlines. In practice, priority assignments result from an interactive process between the development and testing teams. In this article, we propose an automated method that aims to identify the best possible priority assignments in real-time systems, accounting for multiple objectives regarding safety margins and engineering constraints. Our approach is based on a multi-objective, competitive coevolutionary algorithm mimicking the interactive priority assignment process between the development and testing teams. We evaluate our approach by applying it to six industrial systems from different domains and several synthetic systems. The results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms both our baselines, i.e., random search and sequential search, and solutions defined by practitioners. Our approach scales to complex industrial systems as an offline analysis method that attempts to find near-optimal solutions within acceptable time, i.e., less than 16 hours.},

  abstract     = {Background The healthcare sector poses many strategic, tactic and operational planning questions. Due to the historically grown structures, planning is often locally confined and much optimization potential is foregone. Methods We implemented optimized decision-support systems for ambulatory care for four different real-world case studies that cover a variety of aspects in terms of planning scope and decision support tools. All are based on interactive cartographic representations and are being developed in cooperation with domain experts. The planning problems that we present are the problem of positioning centers for vaccination against Covid-19 (strategical) and emergency doctors (strategical/tactical), the out-of-hours pharmacy planning problem (tactical), and the route planning of patient transport services (operational). For each problem, we describe the planning question, give an overview of the mathematical model and present the implemented decision support application. Results Mathematical optimization can be used to model and solve these planning problems. However, in order to convince decision-makers of an alternative solution structure, mathematical solutions must be comprehensible and tangible. Appealing and interactive decision-support tools can be used in practice to convince public health experts of the benefits of an alternative solution. The more strategic the problem and the less sensitive the data, the easier it is to put a tool into practice. Conclusions Exploring solutions interactively is rarely supported in existing planning tools. However, in order to bring new innovative tools into productive use, many hurdles must be overcome.},

The dynamics is a model based on field capacity modes, where the state, x , represents the water in the soil and the control variable, u , is the flow rate of water from irrigation. The variation of water in the soil depends on the field capacity of the soil, 
$$x_{FC}$$
 x FC , weather conditions, losses due to deep percolation and irrigation. Our goal is to minimize the amount of water used for irrigation while keeping the crop in a good state of preservation. To enforce such requirement, the state constraint 
$$x(t) \ge x_{\min }$$
 x ( t ) ≥ x min is coupled with the dynamics, where 
$$x_{\min }$$
 x min is the hydrological need of the crop. Consequently, the problem under study is a state constrained optimal control problem. Under some mild assumptions, we consider several basic profiles for the optimal trajectories. Appealing to the Maximum Principle (MP), we characterize analytically the solution and its multipliers for each case. We then illustrate the analytical results running some computational simulations, where the analytical information is used to partially validate the computed solutions. The need to study irrigation strategies is of foremost importance nowadays since 80},

However, it is unclear how ensemble configurations (model composition and size) influence crop yield projections and uncertainty. Here, we investigate the influences of ensemble configurations on crop yield projections and modeling uncertainty from Global Gridded Crop Models and Global Climate Models under future climate change. We performed a cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of ensemble members based on their projected outcomes, revealing unique patterns in crop yield projections and corresponding uncertainty levels, particularly for wheat and soybean. Furthermore, our findings suggest that approximately six Global Gridded Crop Models and 10 Global Climate Models are sufficient to capture modeling uncertainty, while a cluster-based selection of 3-4 Global Gridded Crop Models effectively represents the full ensemble. The contribution of individual Global Gridded Crop Models to overall uncertainty varies depending on region and crop type, emphasizing the importance of considering the impact of specific models when selecting models for local-scale applications. Our results emphasize the importance of model composition and ensemble size in identifying the primary sources of uncertainty in crop yield projections, offering valuable guidance for optimizing ensemble configurations in climate-crop modeling studies tailored to specific applications. A random selection of six global crop grid models and ten global climate models is sufficient to determine the uncertainty of a model ensemble, but the contribution of each crop model to this uncertainty varies by region and crop type, according to a cluster analysis of future crop yield projections.},

Second, the BWSS optimization model is established by considering the vibration characteristics, including the design object, selected materials, design variables, optimization objective functions and constraints in static and dynamic analyses. Third, a hybrid multi-objective optimization method combining the finite element method, Kriging metamodel and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is proposed. After performing optimization, the Kriging metamodel is discussed, and the final design parameters of a single-arm support structure are obtained by the MOGA. Finally, different MOGA parameters and the screening algorithm are compared and analyzed. Simultaneously, the experimental vibration acceleration data and the shock data of the actual original rehabilitation robot are compared with the numerical results of the optimized design. The numerical results indicate that the proposed hybrid multi-objective optimization method is reliable in terms of designing the BWSS, and the vibration characteristics of the designed BWSS are improved over those of the actual original BWSS.},

  abstract     = {Observation satellite constellation uses onboard remote sensors to cooperatively obtain the ground information from space, which has been widely used in Earth resource detection and military reconnaissance. To efficiently improve both the resolution and coverage performances of the observation satellite constellation, a surrogate-assisted efficient multi-objective optimization scheme is developed in this paper. The multi-objective optimization problem is defined at first to simultaneously improve the payload resolution and coverage performance. To reduce the computational cost for constellation multi-objective optimization, a radial basis function assisted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II method (RBF-NSGA-II) is proposed. In this approach, RBF surrogate is used to approximate the expensive constellation simulation model for optimization. During the optimization process, the surrogate is adaptively refined via k-means clustering method, which leads the search to the Pareto frontier rapidly. Finally, the proposed RBF-NSGA-II is applied to the constellation multi-objective optimization problem compared with the standard NSGA-II algorithm. The optimization results indicate that RBF-NAGA-II outperforms the competitive NSGA-II in terms of the hypervolume index. Moreover, the optimization cost of RBF-NSGA-II is reduced by 75},

However, a single sampling point obtained in each iteration process may cause longer objective-evaluation time and slower convergence speed in contrast with multi-point sampling optimization methods. For this, a Kriging-based multi-point sequential sampling optimization (KMSSO) method is presented. The proposed method uses uncertainty estimate information of Kriging to construct the multiple-point generalized Expected Improvement (EI) criterion. In optimization cycle, this criterion is maximized to produce the Pareto front data, which will be further screened to obtain final expensive evaluation points. For numerical tests and an engineering case, KMSSO is compared to GEGO and HAM algorithm and is shown to deliver better results. It is also proves that when multiple points are added per cycle, the optimization accuracy and convergence property are both improved.},

  abstract     = {In current engineering practice, the vibration serviceability performance is usually checked after the safety design is finished. Such process does not guarantee the optimized design, especially for those large-span truss structures, where the vibration serviceability performance is the controlling factor that dominates the design process. The randomness of the human-induced loads and structures significantly affects the design results. To address such problem, a dynamic-reliability-based topology optimization (DRBTO) method for the vibration serviceability design of large-span truss structures under random human-induced loads is proposed, which employs the probability density evolution method (PDEM) for dynamic reliability analysis and the density approach for solving topology optimization. To reduce the calculation of multiple order force vectors, the conjugation of the force vectors is utilized to reduce half of the calculation in finite element analysis and sensitivity analysis. Unlike other types of dynamic loads, the load positions of human-induced loads also have strong randomness, so the load positions are simulated as uniformly distributed random variables. To better implement the optimization, sensitivity analysis function is adopted for efficient calculation of the structural response sensitivity. Gray-scale operator is adopted to avoid the occurrence of intermediate density. Numerical results with different volume fractions and acceleration thresholds show that the proposed method could give better design results from the perspectives of structural responses and dynamic probability, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and stability of this optimization method.},

Hence, a population state-driven surrogate-assisted differential evolution algorithm (PSSADE) is proposed for solving ECOPs-MI, in which the adaptive population update mechanism (APUM) and the collaborative framework of global and local surrogate-assisted search (CFGLS) are combined effectively. In CFGLS, a probability-driven mixed-integer mutation (PMIU) is incorporated into the classical global DE/rand/2 and local DE/best/2 for improving the diversity and potentials of candidate solutions, respectively, and the collaborative framework further integrates both the superiority of global and local mutation for the purpose of achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Moreover, the current population is adaptively reselected based on the efficient non-dominated sorting technique in APUM when the population distribution is too dense. Empirical studies on 10 benchmark problems and 2 numerical engineering cases demonstrate that the PSSADE shows a more competitive performance than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, PSSADE provides excellent performance in the design of infrared stealth material film.},

  abstract     = {The reduction of wheel-rail wear is a fundamental task in railway engineering that significantly affects the operating performance in the lifecycle. To improve the dynamic response and profile wear evolution performance of wheel-rail interaction, a shape optimization procedure for the railway wheel profile is proposed. First, the geometry modeling method, which ensures the continuity of first-order derivation of the wheel profile, is introduced to generate a large number of candidate profiles, and multibody dynamics simulation is conducted to analyze the dynamics response of the wheel profiles, including wear index, lateral force, lateral acceleration of the frame and derailment coefficient. Then, the Kriging model is constructed to establish the relationship between the design variables and objectives obtained by multibody dynamics simulation, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to evaluate the optimal parameters for wheel profile that simultaneously considers wheel wear, stability, and lateral force. Finally, the performance of the wheel-rail interaction is evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The numerical simulation result indicates that the optimized wheel profile not only has good performance, including contact state, pressure, and friction at the design stage, but also the physical performance is acceptable after a long-term profile evolution during service, which the maximum wear depth of the optimal wheel profile averagely decreases over 10},

However, the optimization design process can be time-consuming due to the multiple design variables involved and the complexity of the mathematical model. This paper proposes a modified efficient global optimization (MEGO) method for solving such demanding surface texture design challenges. The MEGO utilizes a Kriging model with the optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS) for initial sampling and the proposed modified expected improvement (MEI) function for sequential sampling. A comparative study of several global optimization algorithms with the MEGO on the surface texture design is performed. Subsequently, surrogate-based optimization and parameter analysis are carried out, resulting in the identification of an optimal set of texture parameters. The findings reveal the superiority of the MEGO in both model prediction accuracy and refinement of minima. Moreover, compared to the base design, the friction coefficient can be reduced by up to 45.2},

  abstract     = {For the fed-batch ethanol production process, the feed rate is the key to determining the total yield. This paper optimizes the feed rate based on the Kriging model by using the design of dynamic experiments (DoDE). Firstly, a global approximation model is established by sequentially adding points to the initial experimental data set. And virtual samples are generated through the mega-trend-diffusion (MTD) technique to enrich the experimental data set and balance the distribution of data points. Then, a 1/2-fraction factorial design is performed in the optimal solution region to augment the experimental data set, and the locally enhanced global model is built and optimized. Finally, the modeling and optimization process is iterated until the optimal solution meets the convergence criterion. The iterative update and optimization algorithm is applied to ethanol production, which is the free terminal fed-batch fermentation process. The optimal solution of feed rate is convergent, and is of guiding significance for practical production.},

  abstract     = {In rural areas of Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, traditional dwellings are gradually being replaced by self-built brick-concrete houses that mimic urban designs, leading to increased energy consumption and reduced indoor thermal performance. This issue is particularly urgent in economically disadvantaged regions with harsh climatic conditions. Traditional Zhuangke dwellings, however, feature architectural characteristics that are well-suited to the cold climate and limited local resources. Extracting and optimising the passive energy-saving design of these traditional dwellings presents an effective solution to address the conflict between energy efficiency and indoor thermal performance in self-built rural houses. This study Innovatively develops a multi-objective optimisation framework for passive energy-saving design in rural housing in Huangyuan County, using the Rhino and Grasshopper visual programming platform. The framework aims to resolve this conflict. By analysing the design parameters of 53 traditional Zhuangke dwellings, the study optimises 10 passive energy-saving design parameters, including courtyard length, width, building orientation, height, depth, span, ground clearance, window-to-wall ratio, sunroom depth, and north-facing double-wall cavity depth. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution​ (TOPSIS) method is then applied to filter the Pareto optimal solutions. The results show that, compared to the baseline building, the optimised “linear courtyard” Zhuangke dwelling achieves a reduction in heating energy use intensity (EUI) by 1–17.9},

However, there are many uncertainties in the conceptual design, such as the vagueness of customer requirements, uncertainty of design parameters, and diversity of the decision-making, which will lead to fluctuations in the performance or even failure of the scheme in many cases. To solve this problem, a conceptual design model was constructed by considering multi-uncertainties. First, taking satisfaction, performance, and production cost as design objectives, a conceptual design optimization model was established. Secondly, an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based on the expectation-possibility-probability hybrid model was proposed to search the Pareto solutions of conceptual design. Finally, the optimal conceptual design scheme was selected from the Pareto set by using the intuitionistic fuzzy λ-Shapely Choquet integral method. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method were validated by the polishing machine conceptual design.},

Power grid companies use mobile energy storage system(MESS) with lithium battery as power supply to replace diesel emergency power supply vehicle in order to provide environmental and noise-free emergency power service. Due to the different levels of damage caused by power outages to different electricity consumers, power users are divided into four classes, each with a different priority for emergency power supply. To guarantee the emergency power supply of power users under a certain service reliability probability, a maximal expected coverage location model is used to determine the location of emergency power service stations and decide the allocation strategy of MESSs to each emergency power service station. An arithmetic example is used to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the model is able to cover all demand nodes based on a reliability probability of 95},

  abstract     = {Tensile membrane structures (TMS) are gaining wide acceptance in spanning large open areas and are popular for their unique aesthetics. For a given boundary condition, the shape of a TMS subjected only to initial prestress is not known beforehand. The process of finding this shape, or ‘form-finding’, presents various numerical issues and challenges related to its practical implementation. This paper proposes a novel optimisation-based form-finding technique, titled ‘updated weight method’ (UWM), for frame- and cable-supported, minimal and non-minimal TMS. In this, the objective function is defined as a weighted function of the geometrical shape. UWM has the advantage of relating these weights to the desired membrane prestress (and cable tensions) in the equilibrium shape. Issues related to convergence and mesh distortion are also efficiently handled in this method. A wide variety of simple and complex problems are used to test the proposed methodology, and overall, an efficient and accurate form-finding solution is demonstrated for all problems. UWM is adequately generic to incorporate different constraints and to allow the use of any (numerical) optimisation tool of choice.},

The tribological behaviour and advantageous micro-texture geometries and arrangements largely depend on the contact type and the operating conditions. Industrial scale implementation is hampered by the complexity of numerical approaches. This substantiates the urgent need to numerically design and optimize micro-textures for specific conditions. Since these aspects have not been covered by other review articles yet, we aim at summarizing the existing state-of-the art regarding optimization strategies for micro-textures applied in hydrodynamically and elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts. Our analysis demonstrates the great potential of optimization strategies to further tailor micro-textures with the overall aim to reduce friction and wear, thus contributing toward an improved energy efficiency and sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting electrical energy from mechanical vibrations through piezoelectric-based resonant devices is a suitable form of generating alternative electrical sources for several applications, most dedicated to powering small electronic devices. This technique has attracted considerable attention over the past decades, mainly due to piezoelectric materials’ high electrical charge density. However, the amount of harvestable energy is usually small and sensitive to variabilities in design, manufacturing, operation, and environmental conditions. Hence, it is essential to account for predictable and potentially relevant uncertainties during the design of energy harvesting devices. This work presents strategies for the robust design of resonant piezoelectric energy harvesters, considering the presence of uncertainties in design, manufacturing, and mounting conditions, such as the bonding of the piezoelectric materials and the clamping of the resonant device. The work proposes and discusses strategies for finite element modeling, accounting for adhesive bonding of piezoelectric materials and imperfect clamping; harvestable power output mean value and dispersion estimation with Polynomial Chaos Expansion; and robust optimization using multiobjective optimization techniques. Relevant general conclusions concerning harvesting devices include but are not limited to, devices with shorter resonating beams and larger tip masses tend to present performances that are nominally better but also less robust. Additionally, reducing the effective electrical resistance may improve robustness without significantly losing the mean value performance. Also, through an assessment of the most relevant design variables and uncertain parameters, some aspects that should receive special attention when designing, manufacturing, and mounting these devices are discussed, such as the bonding of piezoelectric patches and the clamping of cantilever beams due to their essential effect on the robustness of the device. It is also shown that including well-selected design variables may mitigate the impact of uncertainties and, thus, improve the robustness of the device.},

  abstract     = {For the first time, a new method has been introduced to address the optimal design problem of large and complex steel structures with a focus on minimizing weight. The structures considered in this study represent typical steel factory structures with nonprismatic sections of columns and rafters. The process of simulating this structure, from its geometric representation to a finite-element (FE) model, poses significant challenges using conventional methods. To overcome these challenges, a program was developed using the Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) in the SAP2000 software and MATLAB to establish a new FE model updating technique. The weight optimization process is performed using a newly devised optimization algorithm named KODE. This algorithm combines the advantages of two existing algorithms, namely the K-means clustering optimizer (KO) and the Differential Evolution algorithm (DE). The primary innovation of KODE lies in its ability to generate additional movement directions, ensuring a better balance between the ability of exploitation and exploration compared to the original KO algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of KODE compared to the other algorithms, 23 classical benchmark functions and CEC2005 benchmark functions are employed as initial numerical examples. Subsequently, KODE is applied to optimize objective functions, which is established based on the AISC360-05 design standard (American Institute of Steel Construction 360-05), for optimal weight in a steel factory structure. The results in this study show the efficiency of KODE in solving optimization problems. In particular, KODE has demonstrated high effectiveness and reliability when combined with FE model updating to design optimization for large-scale steel structures.},

The weight allotted to each criterion plays a crucial role in effectively implementing MCDM techniques. In this work, we use the TOPSIS technique with five different subjective and objective weight allocation methods to select the best operating conditions for the machining of SKD11 tool using Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) process. Our results indicate that experimental runs no. 22 and 25 are the best alternatives among all the options tested. The rank plot also suggests that an increase in peak current is better for the overall performance of the EDM process. We observe that the TOPSIS method is not very sensitive to the criteria weights for the current dataset, as evidenced by the correlation between the ranks obtained using the two methods. Moreover, we find that the weights allotted have little effect on the predicted optimum process parameters in the case of the TOPSIS method.},

Real-life physical experiments in the lab are expensive to perform (

 ∼ 6 h of experimentation and subsequent production costs); traditional evolutionary approaches are then ill-suited to solve the problem, due to the prohibitive amount of experiments required for evaluation. In this research, we successfully applied specific machine learning techniques (Gaussian Process Regression and Logistic Regression) to emulate the objective and constraint functions based on a limited amount of experimental data. The techniques are embedded in a Bayesian optimization algorithm, which succeeds in detecting Pareto-optimal process settings in a highly efficient way (i.e., requiring a limited number of experiments).},

For the design, a continuous genetic algorithm able to perform parallel optimization was developed and benchmarked. The results were obtained with mass and sizing models, required to estimate the rocket structure, and created using historical data regression. For the trajectory, once defined its assumptions, the optimality equations are deduced and the optimal values are found using a particle swarm optimization. The multidisciplinary optimization procedure was demonstrated by designing a small launch vehicle and comparing it to a state-of-the-art existing rocket. Promising results were obtained in both design and trajectory optimization, with the imposed constraints adequately handled and the optimal rocket preliminary design with appropriate optimal trajectory found with an affordable computational cost.},

Large-scale IoT applications face challenges like load balancing and scalability within the network due to the inherent vulnerability of ad-hoc structures. This paper proposes a multiHop constant-time complexity clustering algorithm (MultiHopFast) for IoT networks to address these challenges. The proposed MultiHopFast algorithm reduces the computing burden from IoT nodes with smart load balancing to ensure IoT network scalability. The algorithm addresses the network load, scalability, and time efficiency challenges. Using neighbourhood heuristics, the MultiHopFast algorithm builds appropriate size (i.e., up to 5 hops) of clusters with participating IoT nodes. Each cluster is associated with a cluster head (CH) (or a coordinator). The MultiHopFast algorithm probabilistically selects CH for each cluster. When compared with state-of-the-art counterparts, MultiHopFast algorithm: (i) operates with constant-time complexity in a large scale network as well as in small-scale networks, (ii) runs without any impact on network scalability, and (iii) creates 12},

The innovative approach integrates EnergyPlus with local sensitivity analysis (LSA) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) algorithms, thereby facilitating direct sensitivity analysis (SA) capabilities without reliance on external plugins or third-party tools. The effectiveness of this approach is exemplified through its application to a residential building situated in a hot semi-arid climate region of Iran. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a residential building located in a hot semi-arid climate region in Iran. The study utilizes four primary building performance criteria as output variables: annual heating energy consumption (AHC), annual cooling energy consumption (ACC), annual lighting energy consumption (ALC), and the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD). The study employs one-at-a-time (OAT) analysis for LSA and Sobol’s analysis for GSA to investigate the behavior of output variables in response to changes in building design parameters. In the LSA approach, a newly developed sensitivity indicator, termed the Dispersion Index (DI), is introduced to precisely measure the overall sensitivity of outputs to inputs (

An analytical method is implemented to propagate the noise distribution via metamodel and to calculate the statistics of the response accurately and efficiently. The robust optimization criterion as well as the constraints evaluation are adjusted to properly deal with multimodal response.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are gradually gaining attention as a method for solving expensive optimization problems with inequality constraints. Most SAEAs construct a surrogate model for each objective/constraint function and then aggregate approximation functions of constraints to estimate the feasibility of unevaluated solutions. However, because of the aggregation, the differences in the scales among constraints are ignored. Constraints with smaller scales do not benefit from constraint handling techniques as much as larger constraints, while the effects of handling constraints with larger scales scatter to the other many constraints. This results in an inefficient constraint optimization. Accordingly, this work proposes a new SAEA that partially optimizes each objective/constraint, namely surrogate-assisted partial optimization (SAPO). Solutions with better values of objective/constraint are selected from the evaluated solutions as the parent solutions and a focused objective/constraint is independently optimized using surrogate models one by one. Experimental results reveal the superiority of SAPO compared to the state-of-the-art SAEAs on a single-objective optimization problem suite with inequality constraints under an expensive optimization scenario.},

After an earthquake, the focus is on providing medical services and although hospitals are vital in saving lives, they may become overwhelmed with injured patients. As a result, it is essential to establish post-disaster strategies to ensure continued access to medical services. This study introduces a framework that analyses an earthquake’s temporal effect on a hospital network’s emergency response capabilities under various casualty transfer strategies. The framework initially evaluates the seismic vulnerability of buildings to estimate the medical demand and subsequently assesses the resilience of the hospital network based on patients waiting times for ambulance arrivals and treatment in the emergency departments of the hospitals. The model determines the optimal allocation of emergency department capacity across the hospital network and evaluates each hospital’s performance. The framework is implemented in Bayrakli, a metropolitan district in Izmir, Turkey, which has a unique building inventory dataset. The study demonstrated how various casualty transfer decisions can expedite the transportation process, providing valuable insights for creating effective emergency management and mitigation strategies in areas that are prone to earthquakes.},

  abstract     = {The uncertainties in the load and resistant parameters of structures generally lead to a design with failure probability. In reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), the probability of structural failure is defined as an optimization constraint to consider the effect of these uncertainties. The smart improvement and combination of optimization and reliability methods in RBDO is very important and sensitive, especially for complex engineering structures. In the present study, the line sampling method has been improved using the horse optimization algorithm (HOA) to deal with the mentioned issue. The motivation for using these two methods is their high accuracy and speed in solving complex problems. The solution used to achieve this goal is in a way that the random samples are generated along the important direction vector ( 
$$\alpha$$
 α ), and then HOA uses these points to find the position of the limit state function. Different problems including highly nonlinear, high dimensions, passive vehicle suspension system, and vehicle side impact are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the answers are compared with that of the existing methods. Overall, the results indicate an increase in accuracy and speed of problem-solving by the present method.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of minimizing a function that is a sum of convex agent functions plus a convex common public function that couples them. The agent functions can only be accessed via a subgradient oracle; the public function is assumed to be structured and expressible in a domain specific language (DSL) for convex optimization. We focus on the case when the evaluation of the agent oracles can require significant effort, which justifies the use of solution methods that carry out significant computation in each iteration. To solve this problem we integrate multiple known techniques (or adaptations of known techniques) for bundle-type algorithms, obtaining a method which has a number of practical advantages over other methods that are compatible with our access methods, such as proximal subgradient methods. First, it is reliable, and works well across a number of applications. Second, it has very few parameters that need to be tuned, and works well with sensible default values. Third, it typically produces a reasonable approximate solution in just a few tens of iterations.

The framework uses a multi-objective response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve optimum performance. The performance of an FMS is characterized using various weighted measures using the best–worst method (BWM). Subsequently, an RSM approximates the functional relationship between the FMS performance and design variables. The central composite design (CCD) is used for this aim, and a polynomial regression model is fitted among the factors. Eventually, a bi-objective model, including the fitted and cost functions, is formulated and solved. As a result, the optimal percentage for deploying the FMS equipment and machines to achieve optimal performance with the lowest deployment cost is determined. The proposed framework can serve as a guideline for manufacturing organizations to lead strategic decisions regarding the design problems of FMSs. It significantly increases productivity for the manufacturing system, reduces redundant labor and material handling costs, and facilitates production.},

  abstract     = {The proposed effort aims to investigate efficient power generation while minimizing emissions, voltage deviations, and maintaining transmission line voltage stability. The combined heat and power of economic dispatch (CHPED) system is incorporated in the IEEE-57 bus in this presentation to ensure the best possible power flow in the transmission line while meeting the load demand. It is crucial to incorporate renewable energy sources for efficient power generation because fossil fuel sources are evolving daily. The main contribution of the proposed work is firstly, to find optimal solution for optimal power flow (OPF)-based combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem with wind, solar and electric vehicles (EVs). The target is to find out maximum utilization of renewable energy sources for economic power generation, less emission and reduced transmission losses with maintaining the permissible voltage deviation at load buses. Thus, a new approach of electric vehicle to grid has been adopted with wind–solar-CHPED-based OPF system for improving grid reliability and resilience. Secondly, there is a requirement to overcome the local optima problems having low convergence speed. This is obtained by employing a relatively new methodology, known as chaotic-opposition-based driving training-based optimization (DTBO) (CODTBO). Due to the presence of wind, solar, EVs uncertainties, valve point effect, and transmission losses, the system grew more complex. For three different test systems for CHPED-based OPF with and without RESs, the proposed CODTBO algorithm has been put to the test. Results from the tested DTBO, ODTBO approach and the proposed CODTBO have been compared. After integrating wind–solar–EVs with CHPED–OPF, the total fuel cost and emission are reduced by 3.48},

Therefore, this work performed and analyzed the numerical simulation of aluminum extrusion using the finite element method through the COMSOL® Multiphysics software. A visco-plastic modeling approach was used, where the solid, aluminum, is treated as a high viscosity fluid. Furthermore, in order to optimize the process parameters and understand the physical behavior of the problem, a metamodel was built using a quadratic response surface model and, from this, a mono and multiobjective optimization was performed using the Lichtenberg algorithm metaheuristic.

Since the target searching word may be scattered across the document, manually checking each word is exhaustive and time-consuming, which calls for effective visualization of the search results to enable efficient visual document analysis. In this paper, we revisit the problem of visualizing word search results and formulate two design goals: minimizing the number of user interactions and optimizing the on-screen information of search results . Two visualization techniques are introduced accordingly: a structured list that integrates search results with the hierarchical document structure and full sentence snippets to provide more complete local context for each matched result. We then conduct a user study to compare these techniques with some most commonly used visual interfaces. The results show that the structured list is preferred by most participants and leads to more efficient search, whereas the full sentence snippet results in a slight improvement in accuracy and efficiency, but is still appreciated by the participants.

  abstract     = {Geometric and dimensional deviations are the main contributors on quality and cost of products. Specifically, the selection of tolerance types and the appropriate allowable range plays a central role for an effective development process. Nevertheless, the trade-off between expected performances and target costs requires skills and interaction of many areas of engineering design, especially in the early design phases. Despite many tolerance-cost optimization practices are proposed by the research community several limitations still hamper the industrial application: among them, data and parameters sharing, flexibility to application complexity, and integration of simulation tools are the main ones. Focusing on a systematic framework, an integrated modelling and simulation environment is required to take full advantage of the concurrent use of engineering software. The present paper contributes to this aim by suggesting a Computer-Aided framework that integrates Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing simulations and manufacturing cost estimations in a multi-disciplinary optimization environment. Advanced tools are the cornerstones of the suggested framework, enabling easy identification of the main operational steps and providing the automation of the optimization. To be validated and demonstrate the effective applicability, the framework has been applied for the tolerance-cost optimization of an archetypal case study of an automotive engine assembly. The simulation models have been integrated within the optimization, providing several configurations of tolerances from which identify the optimal one. The analysis of optimization results allows to assess the efficiency of the method, highlighting further improvements to extend its robustness, flexibility, and application range.},

  abstract     = {Design of modern antenna systems heavily relies on numerical optimization methods. Their primary purpose is performance improvement by tuning of geometry and material parameters of the antenna under study. For reliability, the process has to be conducted using full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation models, which are associated with sizable computational expenditures. The problem is aggravated in the case of global optimization, typically carried out using nature-inspired algorithms. To reduce the CPU cost, population-based routines are often combined with surrogate modeling techniques, frequently in the form of machine learning procedures. While offering certain advantages, their efficiency is worsened by the curse of dimensionality and antenna response nonlinearity. In this article, we investigate computational advantages of combining population-based optimization with variable-resolution EM models. Consequently, a model management scheme is developed, which adjusts the discretization level of the antenna under optimization within the continuous spectrum of acceptable fidelities. Starting from the lowest practically useful fidelity, the resolution converges to the highest assumed level when the search process is close to conclusion. Several adjustment profiles are considered to investigate the speedup-reliability trade-offs. Numerical results have been obtained for two microstrip antennas and particle swarm optimizer as a widely-used nature-inspired algorithm. Consistent acceleration of up to eighty percent has been obtained in comparison to the single-resolution version with minor deterioration of the design quality. Another attractive feature of our methodology is versatility and easy implementation and handling.},

  abstract     = {Modern microwave design has become heavily reliant on full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools, which are necessary for accurate evaluation of microwave components. Consequently, it is also indispensable for their development, especially the adjustment of geometry parameters, oriented towards performance improvement. However, EM-driven optimization procedures incur considerable computational expenses, which may become impractical even in the case of local tuning, and prohibitive whenever global search is vital (e.g., multi-model tasks, simulation-based miniaturization, circuit re-design within extended ranges of operating frequencies). This work presents a novel approach to a computationally-efficient globalized parameter tuning of microwave components. Our framework employs the response feature technology, along with the inverse surrogate models. The latter permit low-cost exploration of the parameter space, and identification of the most advantageous regions that contain designs featuring performance parameters sufficiently close to the assumed target. The initial parameter vectors rendered in such a way undergo then local, gradient-based tuning. The incorporation of response features allows for constructing the inverse model using small training data sets due to simple (weakly-nonlinear) relationships between the operating parameters and dimensions of the circuit under design. Global optimization of the two microstrip components (a coupler and a power divider) is carried out for the sake of verification. The results demonstrate global search capability, excellent success rate, as well as remarkable efficiency with the average optimization cost of about a hundred of EM simulations of the circuit necessary to conclude the search process.},

This chapter delves into the transformative potential of structural optimization techniques to foster the creation of more sustainable and environment-friendly structural systems. Through the lens of innovative material efficiency, we explore how the strategic use of materials—not merely reducing their quantity but optimizing their application—can lead to structures that uphold or enhance quality, safety, and functionality, while significantly diminishing the environmental footprint of construction activities. We commence with a comprehensive overview of the current state of structural optimization methodologies, including topology, shape, and size optimization, highlighting their relevance and application in the pursuit of sustainability. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits of optimization in structural design, such as the potential to minimize material usage without compromising structural integrity, while also addressing the challenges and limitations inherent in this endeavor.},

  abstract     = {Wind fences are commonly used to mitigate dust emission from coal stockpiles in an open storage yard. There has substantial progress in the trial-and-error study of traditional straight fences, but only limited research focused specifically on the shelter effect of curved fence and its shape optimization. This paper introduces an innovative wind fence with curved deflector, and applies the aerodynamic optimization to enhance its shelter efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are employed to simulate the flow field around a triangular coal stockpile behind the fence using RNG k -ε turbulence model. The simulation results have confirmed the role of curved fences in reducing wind erosion through comparative analysis of different fence geometries. In order to efficiently and automatically explore the optimal design parameters including fence porosity and external shape, the aerodynamic optimization via surrogate modelling is implemented. Two conflicting objectives namely minimization of total absolute surface pressure coefficients and reduction of peak velocity ratios around the stockpile are considered. The weighted sum method is utilized to solve the proposed multi-objective model. The optimization results suggest that the optimal curved fence is associated with a significant improvement of shelter performance in comparison with the traditional straight fence.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world optimization problems, particularly engineering ones, involve constraints that make finding a feasible solution challenging. Numerous researchers have investigated this challenge for constrained single- and multi-objective optimization problems. In particular, this work extends the boundary update (BU) method proposed by Gandomi and Deb (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 363:112917, 2020) for the constrained optimization problem. BU is an implicit constraint handling technique that aims to cut the infeasible search space over iterations to find the feasible region faster. In doing so, the search space is twisted, which can make the optimization problem more challenging. In response, two switching mechanisms are implemented that transform the landscape along with the variables to the original problem when the feasible region is found. To achieve this objective, two thresholds, representing distinct switching methods, are taken into account. In the first approach, the optimization process transitions to a state without utilizing the BU approach when constraint violations reach zero. In the second method, the optimization process shifts to a BU method-free optimization phase when there is no further change observed in the objective space. To validate, benchmarks and engineering problems are considered to be solved with well-known evolutionary single- and multi-objective optimization algorithms. Herein, the proposed method is benchmarked using with and without BU approaches over the whole search process. The results show that the proposed method can significantly boost the solutions in both convergence speed and finding better solutions for constrained optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are the type of WSNs that transmit the data through water medium and monitor the oceanic conditions, water contents, under-sea habitations, underwater beings and military objects. Unlike air medium, water channel creates stronger communication barriers. In addition, the malicious data injection and other network attacks create security problems during data communication. Protecting the vulnerable UWSN channel is not an easy task under critical water conditions. Many research works proposed in the literature used cryptography principles and intelligent intrusion detection systems to secure the network activities from malicious nodes. However, the need for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) associated Medium Access Control (MAC) principles is expected for handling the barriers in uncertain UWSN. In this regard, this article proposes a new Intrusion detection system with Integrated Secure MAC principles and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for organizing real-time neighbor monitoring tasks. The proposed system implements Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) driven UWSN channel assessment models and Secure LSTM-MAC principles to protect the data communication. In this regard, the proposed model creates the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using trained distributed agents. These agents run in each legitimate sensor node contain novel LSTM-MAC engine, intrusion dataset, rule-based monitoring techniques, Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3), Two Fish algorithm and packet filtering tools. The proposed LSTM and agent-based model drives adaptive MAC channel operations to avoid malicious traffics in to legitimate nodes. In addition, this work implements neighbor-based packet monitoring, signal jamming and alert messaging procedures to build reliable security services against different types of attacks. The experiments and the observations reveal the performance of proposed techniques is proved to be 5},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a multifidelity modeling approach to mitigate adverse characteristics of airfoil dynamic stall through aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO). Cokriging regression (CKR) is used to efficiently determine an optimum airfoil shape by combining data from high-fidelity (HF) and low-fidelity (LF) computational fluid dynamics simulations. The HF dynamic stall response is modeled using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and Menter’s SST turbulence model, whereas the LF model is developed by simplifying the HF model with a coarser discretization and relaxed convergence criteria. The CKR model, constructed using various infill criteria to model the objective and constraint functions with six PARSEC parameters, is utilized to find the optimal design. The results show that the optimal shape from CKR delays the dynamic stall angle over 3° while reducing the peak values of the aerodynamic coefficients compared to the baseline airfoil (NACA 0012). Comparing the optimized shapes from the CKR and a HF Kriging regression (HF-KR) shows a similar delay in dynamic stall angle; however, the CKR optimum provides a better design for the current problem formulation while requiring 39},

  abstract     = {Determining staffing levels is essential to ensure appropriate capacity for delivering the services required by the population. This task is complex due to uncertainties in both the volume and type of demand. Deterministic approaches that use the average expected demand can lead to significant imbalances between the suggested staffing levels and the actual demand. Therefore, it is necessary to explore innovative methodologies that can account for uncertainty and provide robust staffing level definitions. In this paper, we address the staffing level problem in the healthcare context, focusing on estimating how future patient demand translates into resource usage. To this end, we propose a four-step methodology. Firstly, patients’ needs are modeled as service pathways, which determine not only the sequence but also the specific timing at which a patient’s care requires the allocation of medical resources (human and/or material). Secondly, patient arrivals are simulated, and each patient is randomly assigned a service pathway. Thirdly, the workload for each type of resource during each time period is computed by aggregating the needs of all patients within that period. Finally, a scenario-based method, the Sample Average Approximation (SAA), is used to determine resource levels for each period in the planning horizon. Numerical experiments based on randomly generated instances demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and highlight its potential usefulness in supporting managers in their decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-Based Optimization has been gaining significant interest in recent years due to its capability of performing optimization of expensive problems using few individual evaluations, thus reducing the computational cost. In that context, multi-fidelity models are able to show higher accuracy by using lower and higher fidelity sources to build the approximate response surface. This allows for a better exploration of the design space while not requiring an excessive number of expensive evaluations. However, for adaptive sampling Surrogate-Based Optimization, there are few robust techniques able to determine the optimal location and fidelity of new data points simultaneously. Also, handling of constrained problems has not yet been extensively explored for Surrogate-Based Optimization using multi-fidelity models. In this work, two alternative variable-fidelity acquisition functions are proposed, namely the Variable-Fidelity Lower Confidence Bound (VF-LCB) and the Variable-Fidelity Weighted Expected Improvement (VF-WEI). Constraint-handling methods which have been proposed for single-fidelity models are also extended to multi-fidelity model-based optimization. State-of-the-art modeling techniques will be used and compared, namely Co-Kriging and Hierarchical Kriging, as well as the popular single-fidelity Kriging model. We also show that Co-Kriging is not able to provide a smooth approximation for the HF source when sources are related by a constant additive term. Whenever possible, results found in this paper are to those from the literature in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A new nonlinear optimal control method is proposed for solving the problem of control and stabilization of the roll motion of aircrafts under the wind-rock effect, with the use of a 5th-order dynamic model. It is proven that the 5-th order dynamic model of the wing-rock effect is a differentially flat system which can be transformed into the input–output linearized form. Next it is shown that the wing-rock model admits nonlinear optimal control. To apply nonlinear optimal control the dynamics of the wing-rock effect undergoes approximate linearization around a temporary operating point that is updated at each iteration of the control algorithm. The linearization takes place through first-order Taylor series expansion and through the computation of the Jacobian matrices of the system’s state-space description. For the approximately linearized model of the wing-rock dynamics an H-infinity feedback controller is designed. Actually, the H-infinity controller gives a solution to the optimal control problem for the wing-rock effect under model uncertainty and parametric variations. For the computation of the feedback gains of the H-infinity controller an algebraic Riccati equation is solved at each time-step of the control method. The stability properties of the control algorithm are demonstrated through Lyapunov analysis. First, it is shown that the control scheme achieves the H-infinity tracking performance which signifies elevated robustness for the control loop of the wing-rock dynamics against model uncertainties and external perturbations. Next, it is also proven that the control loop of the 5th-order wing-rock model is globally asymptotically stable. The proposed control method achieves fast and accurate tracking of setpoints under moderate variations of the control inputs.},

  abstract     = {Cyanobacteria are a potential source of promising secondary metabolites with different biological activities, including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and anticancer activities. To combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent requirement for new drugs, and cyanobacteria metabolites can constitute alternative new antibacterial medication. The chemical complexity of their exopolysaccharides indicates that they have the potential to be bioactive molecules with many biological activities. The present study aimed to produce and optimise a novel alginate polymer from a newly isolated cyanobacterium, S. algini MNE ON864447, in addition to its promising antibacterial activity. We successfully isolated a new cyanobacterium strain, S. algini MNE ON864447 from the Nile River, which produces alginate as an extracellular polymeric substance. The isolated cyanobacterial alginate was identified using a set of tests, including FTIR, TLC, HPLC, GC–MS, and ^1H NMR. Plackett–Burman statistical design showed that working volume (X1), the incubation period (X2), and inoculum size (X3) are the most significant variables affecting the production of alginate. The highest alginate production (3.57 g/L) was obtained using 4},

Two well-known benchmark networks, the two-loop and the Hanoi focused on the proposed method. Finally, the results were discussed in several different cases of application. Also, a new modified layout for the two-loop was investigated.

Importantly, it utilizes uncertainty quantification from surrogate models like Kriging or properties like Lipschitz continuity to approximate a so-called optimistic Pareto optimal set. This enables the decision maker to search in unexplored parts of the Pareto optimal set and requires a small amount of expensive function evaluations. We share the implementation of O-NAUTILUS as open source code. Thanks to its graphical user interface, a decision maker can see in real time how the preferences provided affect the direction of the search.

Este estudo visa determinar a melhor maneira de explorar de forma sustentável um campo de poços ao sul de Bordeaux (França). Atualmente, os 18 poços do campo podem produzir cerca de 10 milhões (M) m^3/ano. A partir de uma revisão completa dos dados de campo, este estudo apresenta um método de otimização com modelos alternativos baseados em um modelo de águas subterrâneas pré-existente e distribuídas espacialmente. Este método utiliza métodos de “coeficiente de influência” para projetar uma estratégia eficiente para explorar as águas subterrâneas, preservando-as do rebaixamento dos aquíferos. Esta abordagem de otimização investiga um número muito maior de combinações que a abordagem clássica de tentativa-e-erro. Embora geralmente se considere que preservar a qualidade das águas subterrâneas implica necessariamente em uma exploração restringida, este trabalho mostra que outras estratégias de exploração podem alcançar este objetivo com um ganho significativo no volume total extraído sem criar novos poços. Duas configurações alternativas, incorporando a criação de novos poços, foram testadas para maximizar a capacidade do campo do poço e otimizar a capacidade efetiva da rede de tubulação existente. Esperam-se ganhos substanciais dessas configurações, alcançando um adicional de 2.2–5.5 M m^3/ano. The strong impact of population increase and the effects of climate change on drinking-water resources mean that it is essential to optimize the management of groundwater. This study aims at determining the best way of sustainably exploiting a well field south of Bordeaux (France). Currently, the field’s 18 wells can produce about 10 million (M) m^3/year. Starting from a complete review of field data, this study presents an optimization method with surrogate models based on a preexisting spatially distributed groundwater model. This uses ‘influence coefficient’ methods for designing an efficient strategy to exploit groundwater, while preserving it from aquifer dewatering. This optimization approach investigates a much larger number of combinations than the classic trial-and-error approach. Though it is usually considered that preserving groundwater quality necessarily implies restricted exploitation, this work shows that other exploitation strategies can reach this objective with a significant gain in the total extracted volume without creating new wells. Two alternative configurations, incorporating the creation of new wells, were tested for maximizing the capacity of the well field and optimizing the effective capacity of the existing pipe network. Substantial gains are expected from those configurations, reaching an additional 2.2–5.5 M m^3/year. El fuerte impacto del aumento de la población y los efectos del cambio climático sobre los recursos de agua potable hacen imprescindible optimizar la gestión de las aguas subterráneas. Este estudio pretende determinar la mejor manera de explotar de forma sostenible un campo de pozos al sur de Burdeos (Francia). Actualmente, los 18 pozos del campo pueden producir unos 10 millones (M) de m^3/año. Partiendo de una revisión completa de los datos del campo, este estudio presenta un método de optimización con modelos sustitutos basado en un modelo preexistente de aguas subterráneas distribuidas espacialmente. En él se utilizan métodos de “coeficiente de influencia” para diseñar una estrategia eficiente de explotación de las aguas subterráneas, preservándolas al mismo tiempo del agotamiento del acuífero. Este enfoque de optimización investiga un número mucho mayor de combinaciones que el enfoque clásico de prueba y error. Aunque se suele considerar que preservar la calidad del agua subterránea implica necesariamente una explotación restringida, este trabajo muestra que otras estrategias de explotación pueden alcanzar este objetivo con una ganancia significativa en el volumen total extraído sin crear nuevos pozos. Se han probado dos configuraciones alternativas, que incorporan la realización de nuevos pozos, para maximizar la capacidad del campo de pozos y optimizar la capacidad efectiva de la red de tuberías existente. Se esperan importantes ganancias adicionales con esas configuraciones, que alcanza 2.2–5.5 M m^3/año. L’impact important de l’augmentation de la population et des effets du changement climatique sur les ressources en eau potable rend essentielle l’optimisation de la gestion des eaux souterraines. Cette étude vise à déterminer la meilleure façon d’exploiter durablement un champ captant au sud de Bordeaux (France). Actuellement, les 18 puits de ce champ captant peuvent produire jusqu’à 10 millions de m^3 par an. En se basant sur un examen complet des données de terrain, cette étude présente une méthode d’optimisation avec un modèle équivalent simplifié basé sur un modèle hydrodynamique distribué préexistant. Il s’agit d’utiliser la méthode des “coefficients d’influence” pour concevoir une stratégie efficace d’exploitation des eaux souterraines tout en préservant l’aquifère du dénoyage. Cette approche d’optimisation permet de considérer un nombre beaucoup plus grand de combinaisons que l’approche classique par essai-erreur. Bien qu’il soit généralement considéré que la préservation de la qualité des eaux souterraines implique nécessairement une exploitation modérée, ces travaux montrent que d’autres stratégies d’exploitation peuvent atteindre cet objectif avec un gain significatif sur le volume total exploité sans créer de nouveaux puits. Par ailleurs, deux configurations alternatives, intégrant la création de nouveaux puits, ont été testées pour maximiser la capacité du champ captant et utiliser pleinement le réseau d’adduction existant. Des gains substantiels sont attendus de ces configurations, atteignant 2.2–5.5 M^3 supplémentaires par an.},

  abstract     = {A power consumption optimization for battery-powered and resource-constrained embedded systems is typically performed on the hardware layer while the application layer is often neglected. Because software applications affect the hardware behavior directly, power-related optimizations can result in major application design and workflow changes. Such in-depth modifications should be considered in early design phases, where they are most effective. For embedded software development, current trends in software engineering such as Model-Driven Development (MDD) can be used for an early power consumption analysis and optimization even if the hardware platform is not yet finalized. However, power consumption aspects on the application layer are currently not sufficiently considered in MDD. In this paper, we present an approach to abstract hardware components of an embedded system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and annotate UML-based models with power characteristics. Additionally, we define a novel UML profile to capture the dynamic behavior of hardware components while interacting with software applications. With our approach, energy profiles can be derived to make the impact of software on power consumption in early design stages visible. Energy profiles are also suitable for software optimization and energy bug detection, which is demonstrated using a sensor node use case example.},

Seminal studies in canine CHF had suggested that the pharmacological action of benazepril was relatively independent of doses greater than 0.25 mg/kg P.O, thereby providing a rationale for the European labeled dose of benazepril in dogs with CHF. However, most of these earlier studies relied on measures of ACE activity, a sub-optimal endpoint to characterize the effect of ACEi on the RAAS. The objectives of this study were ( i ) to expand on previous mathematical modeling efforts of the dose-exposure–response relationship of benazepril on biomarkers of the RAAS which are relevant to CHF pathophysiology and disease prognosis; and ( ii ) to develop a software implementation capable of simulating clinical trials in benazepril in dogs bedside dose optimization. Our results suggest that 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h of benazepril produces the most robust reduction in angiotensin II and upregulation of RAAS alternative pathway biomarkers. This model will eventually be expanded to include relevant clinical endpoints, which will be evaluated in an upcoming prospective trial in canine patients with CHF.},

  abstract     = {The importance of sustainability continues to grow. Considering the entire life cycle of a product is of great importance in evaluating and optimizing sustainability criteria. The greatest impact on sustainability is in the early phase of product development, but the information about the developed system is low. However, resolving the trade-offs between economic, environmental, and technical criteria requires information about the product over its entire life cycle. Many options need to be evaluated, especially in the early stages of product development. It is time-consuming to create detailed simulation models for each option and each stage of the life cycle. Therefore, the knowledge about the product in the phases of the product development process was analyzed, and measurable sustainability indicators for the phases were identified. Furthermore, the necessary models for the evaluation of the sustainability indicators are selected. Based on these findings, the paper presents a framework for the development of sustainable handling systems, which are part of nearly every automated production system, across all life phases. Starting from the requirements of the handling system, this framework helps to identify suitable solutions, evaluate them, and optimize them with respect to their sustainability score.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated optimal welding conditions for copper hairpin windings using a multi-mode Adjustable Mode Beam (AMB) laser with independently controlled center and peripheral beams. Tensile strength tests and cross-sectional analyses were conducted to evaluate welding quality under various conditions. Improper settings led to weak welding or over-welding, with weak welding reducing cross-sectional area and increasing heat generation, while over-welding caused bead misalignment and raised the risk of short-circuit defects. Optimal conditions achieved tensile strengths exceeding 140 kgf and eliminated porosity, attributed to the multi-mode laser's ability to expand the molten region and the use of shielding gas to remove metal vapor. A plasma measurement system was employed to monitor plasma intensity, power, and temperature, facilitating the development of a welding classification algorithm. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) identified weak welding via RMS thresholds, while Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a Moving Average Filter (MAF) classified over-welding. Case studies validated the algorithm’s effectiveness in real-time monitoring. Despite identifying optimal conditions, real-world factors may cause defects, necessitating further tests under diverse conditions. Limited data points were a constraint; expanding datasets would improve accuracy and reliability. Future research aims to enhance the algorithm and adapt it for industrial use, ensuring reliable, eco-friendly electric powertrain systems.},

  abstract     = {Selecting climate model projections is a common practice for regional and local studies. This process often relies on local rather than synoptic variables. Even when synoptic weather types are considered, these are not related to the variable or climate impact driver of interest. Therefore, most selection procedures may not sufficiently account for atmospheric dynamics and climate change impact uncertainties. This study outlines a selection methodology that addresses both these shortcomings. Our methodology first optimizes the Lamb Weather Type classification for the variable and region of interest. In the next step, the representation of the historical synoptic dynamics in Global Climate Models (GCMs) is evaluated and accordingly, low-performing models are excluded. In the last step, indices are introduced that quantify the climate change signals related to the impact of interest. Using these indices, a scoring method results in assessing the suitability of GCMs. To illustrate the applicability of the methodology, a case study of extreme heat in Belgium was carried out. This framework offers a comprehensive method for selecting relevant climate projections, applicable in model ensemble-based research for various climate variables and impact drivers.},

They are scalable and cost efficient as they provide pay-for-use service. Providing acceptable performance while having no knowledge about the kind of application is the main challenge the cloud providers have. Many applications may have the need to be completed before the deadline. In that case, the request has to be completed before the deadline or else it will lead to service level agreement violation. If the cloud provider completes the requests faster, there would be less SLA violations. This will also reduce cost for the user as the functions will be completed sooner. Therefore, improving the completion time of the requests will benefit the user as well as the provider. In this paper, we present a method to improve the completion time of requests using genetic algorithm for allocation of requests to virtual machines that could provide optimal completion time for them.},

  abstract     = {Many currently existing cloud cost optimisation solutions are aimed at cloud infrastructure providers, and they often deal only with specific types of application services. Unlike infrastructure providers, the providers of cloud applications are often left without a suitable cost optimisation solution, especially concerning the wide range of different application types. This paper presents an approach that aims to provide an optimisation solution for the providers of applications hosted in the cloud environments, applicable at the early phase of a cloud application lifecycle and for a wide range of application services. The focus of this research is the development of the method for identifying optimised service deployment option in available cloud environments based on the model of the service and its context, intending to minimise the operational cost of the cloud service while fulfilling the requirements defined by the service level agreement. A cloud application context metamodel is proposed that includes parameters related to both the application service and the cloud infrastructure relevant for the cost and quality of service. By using the proposed optimisation method, knowledge is gained about the effects of the cloud application context parameters on the service cost and quality of service, which is then used to determine the optimal service deployment option. The service models are validated using cloud applications deployed in laboratory conditions, and the optimisation method is validated using the simulations based on the proposed cloud application context metamodel. The experimental results based on two cloud application services demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to provide relevant information about the impact of cloud application context parameters on service cost and quality of service and use this information for reducing service operational cost while preserving the acceptable service quality level. The results indicate the applicability and relevance of the proposed approach for cloud applications in the early service lifecycle phase since application providers can gain valuable insights regarding service deployment decision without acquiring extensive datasets for the analysis.},

The Sunway processor adopted in Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer has demonstrated its performance potential with unique heterogeneous many-core architecture. Although a large number of optimization methods have been proposed, the memory-bound nature of stencil computation and the limited bandwidth of Sunway processor make it challenging to adapt stencil computation efficiently on Sunway processor. To better use the computation capability of Sunway processor, we propose a combined tiling optimization of stencil computation tailored for the architectural features. In addition, we implement double buffering, vectorization, and register communication to further accelerate stencil computation on Sunway processor. We evaluate our method on six stencil benchmarks with different orders and shapes (thus different memory access patterns and computation intensities). The experimental results show that our implementation can achieve 1.97

  abstract     = {Slurry pipeline transportation is widely used in dredging and serves as an essential method for conveying solid materials. However, accurately describing the interaction between slurry and particles through numerical simulations, while optimizing the pipeline structure to improve the performance of slurry pipelines, poses a significant engineering challenge. In this study, a Z-shaped continuous pipeline, designed using B-spline curves, is implemented in the slurry circulation system. The validity of the CFD–DEM method is confirmed through slurry circulation experiments, and the effects of various structural parameters on transportation efficiency and flow characteristics are investigated. By integrating the Kriging surrogate model with the NSGA-II algorithm, a multi-objective optimization method is proposed to reduce computational complexity and improve the sediment-carrying capacity of the Z-shaped pipeline. Using a slurry shield tunneling machine with a diameter of 6.24 m as an example, this study optimizes a Z-shaped pipeline with an inner diameter of 0.3 m and an axial height of 1.5 m. The optimized structural parameters increase the average particle velocity by 8.9},

The carbon footprint created by traditional energy sources highlights the need to reduce energy consumption in all possible areas, including the grid. Along with the rapid progress of information and communication technology (ICT), the ability to access the World Wide Web is also on the rise. New networks and servers are introduced regularly, but many of these busy networks are underutilized in terms of time and space. Green grids come to the rescue through more efficient implementation of energy-efficient grid technologies or the use of energy-efficient equipment. The main aim of Green Networking is to provide an energy-optimized model for data centers. There are four lines of research on different interpretations of the causes of energy loss: Interface Proxy, Green Grid from Energy-aware applications, Energy-aware Infrastructure, and Adaptive Link Rate.

The wing geometry was parametrized using 11 design variables. A multi-fidelity-based co-kriging metamodel was used to replace the multi-disciplinary analysis routine in the optimization problem. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and Euler solvers were used as high and low fidelity aerodynamic solvers while refined and coarse meshes were used with a default Finite Element (FEM) solver for multi-fidelity structural analysis. Latin hypercube sampling was used to generate 100 design points, out of which 30 were used to perform high fidelity simulations and the rest were used for low fidelity simulations. A high fidelity MDA routine run had a computational time of 4 h while the low fidelity runs were of 30 min. A successful and computationally inexpensive coupled aeroelastic optimization methodology has been demonstrated using MDF and co-kriging. The aerodynamic coefficients

Therefore, their protection as an important issue should be considered by the operating managers. Among the types of existing groundwater aquifers, the coastal aquifers need more protection because they could be contaminated by salt in the result of seawater intrusion. Their protection is a priority based on an optimal and comprehensive management model. Increasement of demands in these areas, especially in recent years, requires sustainable and optimal management as one of the main objectives for long-term operation in the future. In order to meet this purpose, a simulation-optimization model of Bandargaz-Nokandeh coastal groundwater system that located in the north of Iran was proposed by the employment of the Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) numerical model and the Non-Dominate Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm. In this study based on the quantitative simulated groundwater model; two managerial issues have been examined; including the control of water-table drawdown and sustainability of extraction from the wells in this aquifer. By combining these two models and implementing them, optimal withdrawal scenarios which examines different aspects of the study objectives, have been extracted. Regarding the decision-making methods of Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Gray Relational Analysis (GRA), and Berda Aggregation method (BAM), the best scenario was determined among the points located on the optimal trade-off curve. The results show that implementations of management strategies to create a sustainable development of the Bandargaz-Nokandeh coastal aquifer, has led to a 48.45 percent decrease in water withdrawal. Also, the comparison of the groundwater table level (GWTL) under the two existing and optimal operating conditions shows a 29.54},

  abstract     = {To settle the challenge of complex satellite system design, the multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problem for a satellite with a large-size payload is investigated in this paper. The satellite MDO problem is defined to minimize the overall mass subject to several practical constraints such as the structural natural frequency and transfer time. Then, considerable efforts are made to establish the analysis models of orbital transfer, space environment, power, geometry, structure, and mass disciplines, considering the inter-coupled relationship between the satellite platform and the payload. Furthermore, a filter-based sequential radial basis function (FSRBF) method is employed to settle the studied satellite MDO problem efficiently and effectively. In this approach, a radial basis function is constructed and adaptively refined to approximate the expensive multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) models for optimization, which notably lowers the computational cost. After optimization, the overall mass of the satellite is successfully reduced by 116.17kg (3.35},

Indeed, Smart Parking Systems (SPS) in smart cities can reduce traffic congestion, reduce the time for searching available parking spots, reduce the CO2 emissions, and offer other benefits, but their efficient resource (parking spot) allocation remains a challenge. In this article, we present our allocation approach using genetic algorithms (GA) with a multi-criteria objective function. We managed to optimize the four criteria of distance, parking space utilization, user preferences and travel time, while considering a set of parkings in a smart city. As a conceptual support of our approach, we propose a meta-model of concepts for smart parking management in IoT context; we also propose a four-layer architecture of SPS in a smart city. Our goal is to maximize parking space utilization, minimize travel time and distance, and satisfy driver preferences. We conducted a set of simulations to highlight significant improvements in the overall optimization of parking spots allocation. The results showed that the GA algorithm satisfied driver’s preferences while minimizing distance and travel time to get a parking spot and also, maximizing parking spots utilization. Furthermore, comparisons of the results obtained with those derived from the FCFS algorithm showed the effectiveness of the GA algorithm.},

We assign penalty functions to each of the decision regions in misclosure space and use the distribution of the misclosure vector to determine the optimal partitioning by minimizing the mean penalty. As each minimum mean penalty partitioning depends on the given penalty functions, different choices can be made, in dependence of the application. For the DIA-estimator, we introduce a special set of penalty functions that penalize its unwanted outcomes. It is shown how this set allows one to construct the optimal DIA-estimator, being the estimator that within its class has the largest probability of lying inside a user specified tolerance region. Further elaboration shows how these penalty functions are driven by the influential biases of the different hypotheses and how they can be used operationally. Hereby the option is included of extending the misclosure partitioning with an additional undecided region to accommodate situations when it will be hard to discriminate between some of the hypotheses or when identification is unconvincing. By extending the analogy with integer ambiguity resolution to that of integer-equivariant ambiguity resolution, we also introduce the maximum probability estimator within the similar larger class.},

Due to the impacts of the unprecedented pandemic, academic institutions have to consider more criteria associated with course scheduling. Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is one of the recent biological-inspired metaheuristics that mimics the survival evolution of flower pollination and the reproduction of plants. This paper presents a novel multiple-objective FPA-based timetabling (MOFPAT) program for optimizing operating costs and resource utilization. The MOFPAT tool was utilized to solve real-life complex problem adopted from a collaborating university. A series of numerical experiments was designed and carried out. The analysis of the experimental results suggested that all FPA parameters were statistically significant. It was also found that the performance of the proposed hybrid FPA (HFPA) outperformed the classical FPA, Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Cuckoo Search both in terms of quality of the best-so-far timetables generated and computational time. The convergence speed of the proposed HFPA was faster than that of the comparative methods, especially for the medium- and large-size problems. In case of multi-objective optimization, non-dominated solutions were mostly found by the proposed HFPA for all problem sizes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a modeling and solution approach for the integrated planning of the planting and harvesting of sucrose cane and energy-cane considering multiple harvesters. An integer linear bi-objective optimization model is proposed, which seeks to find a trade-off between the maximization of the production volumes of sucrose and fiber and the minimization of the operational costs. The model considers the technical constraints of the mill, such as the milling capacity and meeting the monthly demand. A MIP-heuristic based on relax-and-fix and fix-and-optimize strategies with exact decomposition is appropriately proposed to determine approximations to Pareto optimal solutions to this problem. These approximations are used as incumbents for a branch-and-bound tree to generate potentially Pareto optimal solutions. The results reveal that the MIP-heuristic efficiently solves the problem for real and semi-random instances, generating approximate solutions with a reduced error and a reasonable computational effort. Moreover, the different solutions quantify the trade-off between cost and production volume, opening up the possibility of increasing sucrose and fiber content or decreasing the costs of solutions found. Thus, the proposed bi-objective approach, the solution technique and the different Pareto optimal solutions obtained can assist mill managers in making better decisions in sugarcane production.},

  abstract     = {The performance of surrogate-based optimization is dependent on the surrogate training set, certainly for realistic optimizations where the high cost of computing the training set data imposes small training set sizes. This is especially true for multi-fidelity surrogate models, where different training sets exist for each fidelity. Adaptive sampling methods have been developed to improve the fitting capabilities of surrogate models, adding training points only where necessary or most useful to the optimization process (i.e., providing the highest knowledge gain) and avoiding the need for an a priori design of experiments. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the adaptive sampling is highly affected by its initialization. The paper presents and discusses a novel initialization strategy with a limited training set for adaptive sampling. The proposed strategy aims to reduce the computational cost of evaluating the initial training set. Furthermore, it allows the surrogate model to adapt more freely to the data. In this work, the proposed approach is applied to single- and multi-fidelity stochastic radial basis functions for an analytical test problem and the shape optimization of a NACA hydrofoil. Numerical results show that the results of the surrogate-based optimization are improved, thanks to a more effective and efficient domain space exploration and a significant reduction of high-fidelity evaluations.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to determine the reasonable structural parameters of the external engagement cylindrical gear flowmeter (EGF) under the interference of random factors, so as to ensure that the EGF system has high structural reliability and robustness of performance index response. In addition to the influence of its own structural parameters (e.g., gear structure parameters, gap height), the random factors (e.g., oil viscosity, pressure, temperature and flow rate) can affect multiple performance indexes (e.g., flow pulsation, internal leakage and total power loss) in different ways, thus reducing the structural robustness of the performance response and increasing the difficulty of optimization design and subsequent accuracy compensation of the EGF. In addition, machining and assembly errors also increase the probability of structural failure of the system. In this paper, based on the Basis-adaptive polynomial chaos expansion (Basis-adaptive PCE) surrogate model technology, an uncertainty optimization design method of EGF is proposed, which improves the robustness of the performance index response while ensuring the structural reliability. Multidisciplinary modeling of the performance index of EGF is performed to derive the performance state function. Based on the design of experiments, the influence trend of random factors on performance index was analyzed. The Basis-adaptive PCE method can significantly improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification while ensuring high calculation accuracy and can be applied to the subsequent calculation of optimization design. Based on the results of uncertainty analysis, the optimization index of EGF is determined and the uncertainty optimization design is carried out. Compared with the deterministic optimization, the results show that the uncertainty optimization strategy can significantly reduce the probability of undercutting failure of the measuring gear and the fluctuation of the internal leakage response, thus effectively improving the comprehensive performance and can be applied to the optimization design of EGF.},

  abstract     = {The occupant restraint system (ORS) focuses on automobile crash safety, which can effectively reduce passenger injury. For an ORS, some design parameters are uncertainties, but even they may have correlations. It is noted that the ORS is typically characterized by various occupant injury indices, and uncertainties and their correlations will impact these indices, while most existing design problems have been formulated as a single objective optimization. To address these issues, this paper combines a multidimensional parallelepiped model with a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) for the vehicle ORS design. First, a multiobjective optimization model for the ORS design considering interval uncertainties and their correlations is developed to balance the design requirements for multiple objectives. Second, the established multiobjective optimization model considering parametric correlations is converted into an independent interval multiobjective optimization model in the transformed cuboid domain. Third, the interval multiobjective optimization model is converted into a deterministic multiobjective optimization model by the use of the interval order relation and interval possibility degree. Finally, the optimization problem is solved by coupling the multiobjective GA with the interval expansion method. The ORS design of a 100},

This paper proposes a new optimized structure—QUasi-Affine TRansformation Evolutionary for the Fish Migration Optimization (QTFMO). The new algorithm introduces the evolution matrix of the QUasi-Affine TRansformation Evolutionary (QUATRE) algorithm. Simultaneously, it also increases the disturbance of the individual optimal position to the search agent position in the fecundity stage. By improving the update of the strategy of individual positions, the particle movement process is more scientific and the search space is broader. It largely avoids premature convergence of FMO. We compared the new algorithm with five other intelligent algorithms through 23 different types of test functions and applied the new algorithm to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental results reveal that the newly proposed QTFMO has powerful competitiveness and can achieve better path planning.},

  abstract     = {Tailor-welded blank (TWB), one of the representative technologies in the modern manufacturing process, has the vast applied foreground in energy absorbers of automotive industries due to its significant advantages in better load-bearing capacity and lightweight. The mechanical performance of TWB structures is closely related to its thickness distribution and its location of weld lines. However, so far good algorithm has not been developed to design TWB structure considering concurrently these two aspects due to the time-consuming nature of impact dynamics and the complexity of TWB structure. To find its optimal thickness distribution and optimal location of weld lines, an optimization strategy is proposed to improve crashworthiness of the TWB structures. Firstly, the target force–displacement method is used to find thickness distribution of initial structures. Then, a finite element modeling technology of TWB developed to obtain the finite element model of TWB structures is automatically converted from that of the initial structures according to the results of the fore step. Finally, set uniform thicknesses constraint and find optimal thickness distribution of the TWB structure by using TFD method again. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method comprehensively considers two important design objectives of TWB structures. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method because it can obtain thickness distribution and location of weld lines of the TWB structure, and tailor the force–displacement response of the designed structure to closer a targeting force–displacement curve.},

The low-entropy indexes of collaborative optimization of workshop layout and scheduling were analyzed, and the makespan, processing quality loss, and production cost were considered to be the optimization objectives. Accordingly, a low-entropy collaborative mathematical model of workshop layout and scheduling was constructed. Based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm for differential cell processes, an agent structure was introduced, and a new mutation strategy was designed. Considering the environmental disturbance factors, an agent cellular automata and differential evolution (ACADE) algorithm was proposed for solving the layout and scheduling coordination. Moreover, a case study was conducted, which provided basic theoretical methods and technical support for the coordinated optimization of workshop layout and scheduling.},

  abstract     = {Rationally designed molecular circuits describable by well-mixed chemical reaction kinetics can realize arbitrary Boolean function computation yet differ significantly from their electronic counterparts. The design, preparation, and purification of new molecular components poses significant barriers. Consequently, it is desirable to synthesize circuits from an existing “fridge” inventory of distinguishable parts, while satisfying constraints such as component compatibility. Heuristic synthesis techniques intended for large electronic circuits often result in non-optimal molecular circuits, invalid circuits that violate domain-specific constraints, or circuits that cannot be built with the current inventory. Existing “exact” synthesis techniques are able to find minimal feedforward Boolean circuits with complex constraints, but do not map to distinguishable inventory components. We present the Fridge Compiler, an SMT-based approach to find optimal Boolean circuits within a given molecular inventory. Empirical results demonstrate the Fridge Compiler’s versatility in synthesizing arbitrary Boolean functions using three different molecular architectures, while satisfying user-specified constraints. We showcase the successful synthesis of all 256 three-bit and 65,536 four-bit predicate functions using a large custom inventory, with worst-case completion times of only seconds on a modern laptop. In addition, we introduce a unique class of cyclic molecular circuits that cover a larger number of Boolean functions than their conventional counterparts over a common inventory, often with significantly smaller implementations. Importantly, and absent in previous approaches specific to molecular circuits, the Fridge Compiler is logically sound, complete, and optimal for the user-specified cost function and component inventory.},

Furthermore, they cannot accommodate arbitrary analysis fidelities, directly handle multidisciplinary problems, or provably converge to the high-fidelity optimum. In this paper, we present a practical multifidelity approach that leverages the advantages of conventional gradient-based approaches. Rather than constructing a multifidelity surrogate, we perform a sequence of single-fidelity gradient-based optimizations.

  abstract     = {In the scope of the DLR project VicToria (Virtual Aircraft Technology Integration Platform), an integrated process for aero-structural wing optimization based on high fidelity simulation methods is continuously developed and applied. Based upon a parametric geometry, flight performance under transonic flight conditions and manoeuvre loads are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Structural mass and elastic characteristics of the wing are determined from structural sizing of the composite wing box for essential manoeuvre load cases using computational structural mechanics. Static aeroelastic effects are considered in all flight conditions and active manoeuvre load alleviation is integrated in the process. Global aero-structural wing optimizations are successfully performed for wings with and without active manoeuvre load alleviation. The active manoeuvre load alleviation is introduced with a simplified modelling of control surface deflections using a mesh deformation technique. The minimization of the fuel consumption for three typical flight missions represents the objective function. Wing optimizations are performed for variable and constant wing planform parameters as well as for wings with conventional composite wing box structure and for more flexible wings. The latter is accomplished by introducing modifications of the structural concept and the strain allowable. A significant mass reduction of the optimized wing box is obtained for wings with active manoeuvre load alleviation, resulting in a drop in fuel consumption of about 3},

  abstract     = {Programming on heterogeneous hardware architectures using OpenCL requires thorough knowledge of the hardware. Many High-Performance Domain-Specific Languages (HPDSLs) are aimed at simplifying the programming efforts by abstracting away hardware details, allowing users to program in a sequential style. However, most HPDSLs still require the users to manually map compute workloads to the best suitable hardware to achieve optimal performance. This again calls for knowledge of the underlying hardware and trial-and-error attempts. Further, very often they only consider an offloading mode where compute-intensive tasks are offloaded to accelerators. During this offloading period, CPUs remain idle, leaving parts of the available computational power untapped. In this work, we propose a tool named OptCL for existing HPDSLs to enable a heterogeneous co-execution mode when capable where CPUs and accelerators can process data simultaneously. Through a static analysis of data dependencies among compute-intensive code regions and performance predictions, the tool selects the best execution schemes out of purely CPU/accelerator execution or co-execution. We show that by enabling co-execution on dedicated and integrated CPU-GPU systems up to 13

  abstract     = {Efficient global optimization (EGO) is one of the most popular sequential adaptive design (SAD) methods for expensive black-box optimization problems. A well-recognized weakness of the original EGO in complex computer experiments is that it is serial, and hence the modern parallel computing techniques cannot be utilized to speed up the running of simulator experiments. For those multiple points EGO methods, the heavy computation and points clustering are the obstacles. In this work, a novel batch SAD method, named “Accelerated EGO”, is forwarded by using a refined sampling/importance resampling (SIR) method to search the points with large expected improvement (EI) values. The computation burden of the new method is much lighter, and the points clustering is also avoided. The efficiency of the proposed batch SAD is validated by nine classic test functions with dimension from 2 to 12. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm indeed can parallelize original EGO, and gain much improvement compared against the other parallel EGO algorithm especially under high-dimensional case. Additionally, the new method is applied to the hyper-parameter tuning of support vector machine (SVM) and XGBoost models in machine learning. Accelerated EGO obtains comparable cross validation accuracy with other methods and the CPU time can be reduced a lot due to the parallel computation and sampling method.},

  abstract     = {The resistance force variation of the electromagnetic buffer is its core performance. To reduce its peak values, this paper designs a segmented electromagnetic buffer scheme, and further proposes a novel optimization framework based on robust game theory considering the parameter uncertainty. The most challenging step of the robust Nash problem is to identify the worst-case scenario of the cost function under uncertainty. To attack this, an interval model is applied to describe the necessary uncertainty. Using the affine arithmetic, the uncertainty quantity is re-written into affine form; thus, the worst-case scenario of the cost function can be directly obtained. However, affine arithmetic can only deal with functions with explicit expressions. To address such deficiency, the Chebyshev polynomial expansion is formulated to convert the cost functions of the original electromagnetic buffer model into explicit expressions. The detailed assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for better resultant force performance; besides, it significantly improves the computational efficiency without compromising accuracy when solving the robust Nash equilibrium.

This requires the design of an efficient and optimal task-scheduling strategy that can play a vital role in the functioning and overall performance of the cloud computing system. Optimal Schedules are specifically needed for scheduling virtual machines in fluctuating     unpredictable dynamic cloud scenario. Although there exist numerous approaches for enhancing task scheduling in the cloud environment, it is still an open issue. The paper focuses on an improved     enhanced ordinal optimization technique to reduce the large search space for optimal scheduling in the minimum time to achieve the goal of minimum makespan. To meet the current requirement of optimal schedule for minimum makespan, ordinal optimization that uses horse race conditions for selection rules is applied in an enhanced reiterative manner to achieve low overhead by smartly allocating the load to the most promising schedule. This proposed ordinal optimization technique and linear regression generate optimal schedules that help achieve minimum makespan. Furthermore, the proposed mathematical equation, derived using linear regression, predicts any future dynamic workload for a minimum makespan period target.},

Despite the circular economy providing an optimal vision for the development balance between the environment and the economy, the main challenge regarding industrial practices is its innovation business model. The airline industry has experienced rapid growth and has become an increasingly significant actor in the global transport chain. However, resource optimization is a key enabler for a circular economy policy promotion in the sustainable airline service industry. This study developed an innovation business decision model for sustainable airline service, which aims to help managers evaluating a set of the most effective criteria for selecting an airline business model. It also sought to understand sustainable airline development and identify its causal-effect factors, as well as the optimal portfolios of a service business model. Further, this study integrated the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Analytic Network Process (ANP), and Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP) for decision evaluation on sustainable aviation service innovation under the consideration of resource optimization. The results revealed that customer requests and natural sustainability were the catalysts for evaluating a sustainable airline service innovation business model. On the other hand, converting airliners to freighters (CAF), resource supply chain (RSC), and jet engine leasing (JEL) were the optimal business model portfolios. This study highlights the importance of understanding the innovation business model evaluation for sustainable airline service. Furthermore, it offers a decision infrastructure to managers to help the airline industry realize sustainable circular value, simultaneously, it also contributes to achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7, SDG 9, and SDG 17).},

  abstract     = {The micro- and nanopore throats in shale oil reservoirs are finer than those in conventional oil reservoirs and have a larger specific surface area, potentially resulting in a more pronounced crude oil boundary effect. The prediction of recoverable reserves in shale oil reservoirs is influenced by factors such as geological complexity, fracture characteristics, and multiphase flow characteristics. The application of conventional reservoir seepage theories and engineering methods is challenging because of the unique characteristics of shale formations. A novel computational framework is proposed for the prediction of recoverable reserves and optimization of fracturing parameters by combining machine learning algorithms with causal discovery. Based on the theory of causal inference, the framework discovers the underlying causal relationships of the data, mines the internal laws of the data, and evaluates the causal effects, aiming to build an interpretable machine learning model to better understand the properties of shale oil reservoirs. Compared to traditional methods, the interpretable machine learning model has an outstanding prediction ability, with R^2 of 0.94 and average error as low as 8.57},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted optimization algorithms are a commonly used technique to solve expensive-evaluation problems, in which a regression model is built to replace an expensive function. In some acquisition functions, the only requirement for a regression model is the predictions. However, some other acquisition functions also require a regression model to estimate the “uncertainty” of the prediction, instead of merely providing predictions. Unfortunately, very few statistical modeling techniques can achieve this, such as Kriging/Gaussian processes, and recently proposed genetic programming-based (GP-based) symbolic regression with Kriging (GP2). Another method is to use a bootstrapping technique in GP-based symbolic regression to estimate prediction and its corresponding uncertainty. This paper proposes to use GP-based symbolic regression and its variants to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), which are under the framework of a surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm (SMOA). Kriging and random forest are also compared with GP-based symbolic regression and GP2. Experiment results demonstrate that the surrogate models using the GP2 strategy can improve SMOA’s performance.},

Owing to the limitations of the control position and the complexity of the processing environment, existing methods exhibit several shortcomings in the design and comprehension of the control system. Therefore, an optimal active chatter control method is proposed in this paper; the control weight parameters, input ways, and state prediction effects of the controller are explored in depth. First, a new active control device with adjustable control positions is designed utilizing piezoelectric actuators. The control system is expected to achieve good performance for the chatter induced by the flexibility of the milling tool. Then based on the presented chatter control system, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is used to calculate the optimal control force. In addition, the Kalman filter is applied to predict the optimal state feedback value, based on which an optimal active chatter control strategy is proposed. Simulation results indicate that the saturation problem of the actuator can be solved effectively by using incremental input control. The Kalman filter is a state observer that can predict the response of the system accurately. Finally, some milling experiments are carried out utilizing the designed active control device. The experimental results prove that the proposed optimal control method can suppress the milling chatter effectively.},

In order to reduce the computational source, multiple popular individual surrogates containing polynomial response surface (PRS), radial basis functions (RBF), kriging (KRG) and multiple derived ensemble models are constructed to replace the computationally expensive black-box functions. Moreover, a new multi-points infill strategy is presented to accelerate the optimization. New promising points are located by alternately using a hybrid and adaptive promising sampling (HAPS) method and a multi-start sequential quadratic programming (MSSQP) method.

Three basic surrogate PRS, RBF, KRG-based global optimization methods using the similar multi-points infill strategy, PRSMPIGO, RBFMPIGO and KRGMPIGO are both considered as the comparative methods.

  abstract     = {Real-time interaction with uncertain and dynamic environments is essential for robotic systems to achieve functions such as visual perception, force interaction, spatial obstacle avoidance, and motion planning. To ensure the reliability and determinism of system execution, a flexible real-time control system architecture and interaction algorithm are required. The ROS framework was designed to improve the reusability of robotic software development by providing a distributed structure, hardware abstraction, message-passing mechanism, and application prototypes. Rich ecosystems for robotic development have been built around ROS1 and ROS2 architectures based on the Linux system. However, because of the fairness scheduling principle of the default Linux system design and the complexity of the kernel, the system does not have real-time computing. To achieve a balance between real-time and non-real-time computing, this paper uses the transmission mechanism of ROS2, combines it with the scheduling mechanism of the Linux operating system, and uses Preempt_RT to enhance the real-time computing of ROS1 and ROS2. The real-time performance evaluation of ROS1 and ROS2 is conducted from multiple perspectives, including throughput, transmission mode, QoS service quality, frequency, number of subscription nodes and EtherCAT master. This paper makes two significant contributions: firstly, it employs Preempt_RT to optimize the native ROS2 system, effectively enhancing the real-time performance of native ROS2 message transmission; secondly, it conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the real-time performance of both native and optimized ROS2 systems. This comparison elucidates the benefits of the optimized ROS2 architecture regarding real-time performance, with results vividly demonstrated through illustrative figures.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of the engineering system is becoming more and more significant as time progresses, and a large number of metamodel-based multi-objective optimization methods have been proposed during the past decades. For a metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method, the accuracy of the solution is greatly influenced by the prediction accuracy of the metamodels. This study developed a novel metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method using an adaptive multi-regional ensemble of metamodels (AMEM) to get an optimization method with higher accuracy and efficiency. Two strategies were employed in this new metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method. One strategy is that several stand-alone metamodels, i.e., polynomial regression (PR), radial basis function (RBF), and Kriging (KRG) were combined into an ensemble of metamodels (EM) using the weight sum approach. The other strategy is that new design points were dynamically added into various local regions where the Pareto optimal designs are located, and each basis model and its weight factors were regenerated simultaneously, which adaptively improved the accuracy of the constructed adaptive multi-regional ensemble of metamodels. Besides, two novel approaches for selecting new design points from Pareto optimal set were proposed in this study. The performance of this novel metamodel-based multi-objective optimization method was evaluated using twelve mathematical functions and two practical engineering optimization problems. The twelve mathematical functions were typically selected from previous studies, and the two practical engineering optimization problems are crashworthiness optimization of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)-filled tube (one design variable) and buffer performance optimization of airbags used in the re-entry capsule (two design variables). To compare the advantages of this method, the optimization of these problems was also implemented by common metamodel-based methods. The results showed that the adaptive multi-regional ensemble of metamodels-based multi-objective optimization method is more accurate than the common methods in both mathematical functions and engineering optimization problems. In addition, the adaptive multi-regional ensemble of metamodels-based multi-objective optimization method has better efficiency than the common method, especially in practical engineering optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Reducing the weight of floor beams is a promising way to carry out the lightweight design of the rack car body. However, the reduction will generally amplify the vibration of the car body chassis transmitted to the floor and cause a decrease in riding comfort. Moreover, the lightweight design of the rack floor beams still depends on engineer’s experiences. To address the issues, a cross-section layout method combing bionic with multi-objective topology optimization was proposed. According to the method, a novel bionic layout of rack floor beams offering out-standing reducing weight, vibration performance, in which the configuration elements of bionic quasi-ellipses replaced traditional straight lines in their cross-sections, was proposed. Firstly, a finite element modeling under multiple load cases for rack floor beams was built. Secondly, we screened an optimal load path using a multi-objective topology optimization method considering modal factors, and then constructed a novel bionic layout of cross-sections from beetles. Subsequently, considering minimizing the total mass (M) while maximizing the first-order vertical bending modal frequency (FVBMF) as two optimization objectives, a surrogate-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) were then utilized in sequence to construct the surrogate models, solve optimization process for geometrical parameters of the cross-section, and identify the best trade-off design. Moreover, the multi-objective geometrical parameter optimization under multiple load cases were investigated. The results show that the parameter tt has a more significant influence on the mass and modality of floor beams, and the parameter

  abstract     = {Environmental flow is the minimum threshold value of streamflow discharge to guarantee the sustainable development of river environments. In this study, we propose an optimization approach to establish a balance between the water resource supply and environmental conservation based on the mixed moving average (MMA) process as a superposition of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations. We show that a certain jump-driven MMA process can be suitable for describing the non-Gaussian streamflow discharge time series that has a sub-exponential autocorrelation. Furthermore, we introduce Markov lift to efficiently approximate the MMA process and its characteristic function, from which we obtain the stationary probability density of the process through a Fourier inversion. Then, we formulate a convex optimization problem of intaking river water to meet a prescribed target intake subject to a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a risk measure of small water depth. Based on the Markov lift and a regularized CVaR, the optimization problem is numerically solved using a gradient descent method. Notably, the CVaR constraint is essential for endogenously deriving the optimal intake policy that guarantees the positive minimum discharge, which is the environmental flow, without explicitly imposing it as a constraint. Lastly, we identify the MMA process for different river environments and solve the associated optimization problems to analyze the sensitivity of the optimal intake policy and environmental flow.},

  abstract     = {Forest carbon sequestration capacity in China remains uncertain due to underrepresented tree demographic dynamics and overlooked of harvest impacts. In this study, we employ a process-based biogeochemical model to make projections by using national forest inventories, covering approximately 415,000 permanent plots, revealing an expansion in biomass carbon stock by 13.6 ± 1.5 Pg C from 2020 to 2100, with additional sink through augmentation of wood product pool (0.6-2.0 Pg C) and spatiotemporal optimization of forest management (2.3 ± 0.03 Pg C). We find that statistical model might cause large bias in long-term projection due to underrepresentation or neglect of wood harvest and forest demographic changes. Remarkably, disregarding the repercussions of harvesting on forest age can result in a premature shift in the timing of the carbon sink peak by 1–3 decades. Our findings emphasize the pressing necessity for the swift implementation of optimal forest management strategies for carbon sequestration enhancement. The authors show China’s forests can sequester 172.3 million tons of carbon per year in biomass by 2100, with an additional 28.1 million tons from improved management practices, but neglecting wood harvest impacts will distort long-term future projections.},

  abstract     = {The continuous expansion of renewable energy sources and their ongoing integration into existing power networks, alongside the emergence of new types of loads, has led to significant new challenges emerging for power grid source–load coordination scheduling in recent years. To fully harness the demand response (DR) potential of the load side of such systems, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling method based on DR and the Stackelberg game. A Stackelberg game model is established to formulate day-ahead source–load coordinated scheduling problem, taking account of the stochastic dynamic characteristics of the load response process and user electricity consumption satisfaction with electricity consumption. The model is essentially a strongly nonlinear optimization problem, however; thus, to avoid several of the limitations seen in traditional optimization methods, a data-model fusion-driven method is proposed, with electricity prices formulated by the data-driven method used as input for a model-driven method whose output is then used in turn to guide a data-driven formulation of electricity prices. Case studies on IEEE test systems are used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {For wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process the interlayer temperature highly influences the quality of manufactured parts. This paper proposes an optimisation of deposition parameters for a better control of interlayer temperature while reducing the printing time employing a Finite Element (FE) model and a metamodel based on Non Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS) entities for a thin-walled part in aluminium alloy. Firstly, the thermal FE model is created to extract the interlayer temperature as a function of different deposition parameters that will be optimised. These parameters are the wire feed speed and the cooling time between deposition of two consecutive layers. Then, a NURBS-based metamodel is generated to approximate the (unknown) transfer function between input variables and output responses of the problem at hand. One of the advantages of this metamodeling strategy is the possibility of obtaining the gradient of the output responses without the requirement of further computational resources, as the resulting metamodel is available in analytical form with the requisite continuity and differentiability. The NURBS-based metamodel is generated as a solution of a three-step optimisation strategy aiming at determining all the parameters defining the shape of the NURBS entity. Finally, the NURBS-based metamodel is included in the optimisation process related to the considered application. The optimisation problem is defined as a weighted sum of different criteria, i.e., total printing time and the average interlayer temperature difference for each layer. The solution obtained is subsequently validated a posteriori using the high-fidelity FE model, demonstrating an excellent agreement between the prediction of the NURBS-based metamodel and those of the FE model.},

  abstract     = {Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is widely used in various engineering fields to quantitatively analyse the influence of uncertainty, while alleviating the problem of dimensionality curse. However, current sparse PCE techniques focus on choosing features with the largest coefficients, which may ignore uncertainties propagated with high order features. Hence, this paper proposes the idea of selecting polynomial chaos basis based on information entropy, which aims to retain the advantages of existing sparse techniques while considering entropy change as output uncertainty. A novel entropy-based optimization method is proposed to update the state-of-the-art sparse PCE models. This work further develops an entropy-based synthetic sparse model, which has higher computational efficiency. Two benchmark functions and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) experiment are used to compare the accuracy and efficiency between the proposed method and classical methods. The results show that entropy-based methods can better capture the features of uncertainty propagation, improving accuracy and reducing sparsity while avoiding over-fitting problems.},

Batch PAR with integer least-squares (ILS) is helpful, but selecting an optimal subset must compare all possible combinations, which is time-consuming. In this study, we introduced the classic optimal stopping theory (OST) to dynamically identify ambiguity subsets in batch PAR, which aims to maintain the accuracy and reduce the process time. The process of selecting the ambiguity subset was divided into two stages: observation and decision. All the options in the observation stage were discarded, and the choice was only made in the decision stage. The classic OST has demonstrated that there is a maximum 37},

The maximum residual stress after reflow soldering is obtained by simulating the melting forming and cooling solidification stages of the solder joints. The MFS between the size parameters such as the height of the solder joint and the radius of the pad and the maximum residual stress after reflow soldering is established. The meshes of different sizes are divided into two stages, and the nested and non-nested sampling methods are adopted to form four MFSs. By comparing the prediction effect of the MFS with the single-fidelity surrogate model, namely the radial basis function, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the solder joint size parameters based on the prediction results of the MFS. The results show that the prediction effect of the MFS is better than that of the single-fidelity surrogate model; The best construction scheme of the MFS is: in the simulation stage of solder joint melting forming, mesh generation with different precision is carried out to obtain high/low precision sample points, and the sample points are not nested. The results of PSO prove the validity of the MFS and obtain the optimal solder joint parameters.},

  abstract     = {Une retenue sur la rivière est une alternative à la recharge artificielle des eaux souterraines dans les aquifères côtiers, en ce qu’elle atténue l’intrusion de l’eau de mer causée par les activités humaines. La présente étude met en œuvre un nouveau cadre d’optimisation multiobjectifs en vue de la gestion des mesures d’ingénierie existantes concernant la retenue multibarrages de la rivière et des stratégies d’exploitation des eaux souterraines dans le Bassin de la Rivière Dagu, un bassin du Nord de la Chine affecté par une pénurie d’eau. Le cadre d’optimisation intègre un modèle numérique calibré avec un ensemble conceptualisé de rivières dans le but de simuler l’interaction entre La Rivière Dagu et les eaux souterraines attribuable à la retenue de la rivière; il se concentre sur le compromis entre la minimisation de l’étendue de l’intrusion d’eau salée, la minimisation des infiltrations de la rivière et la maximisation de l’exploitation admissible des eaux souterraines.

Les résultats montrent que le niveau de l’eau de la rivière et les schémas d’exploitation des eaux souterraines peuvent être ajustés de manière à réaliser les compromis optimaux entre les différents objectifs.

Qui plus est, face à la contrainte de réduction des prélèvements dans les eaux souterraines, l’exploitation annuelle dans les quatre divisions administratives au rang de comtés devrait être réduite de 1.2–1.5 millions m^3 ou davantage dans les années recevant moins de précipitations par rapport à celle des années recevant plus de précipitations.

River impoundment is an alternative to artificial groundwater recharge in coastal aquifers, while mitigating seawater intrusion caused by anthropogenic activities. This study implements a new multiobjective optimization framework for management of the existing engineering measures of river multidamming impoundment and strategies for groundwater abstraction in Dagu River Basin, a water-scarce basin in north China. The optimization framework integrates a calibrated numerical model with a conceptualized river package to simulate the interaction between the Dagu River and groundwater due to river impoundment, and it focuses on the tradeoff among minimizing the seawater intrusion extent, minimizing the river seepage, and maximizing the allowable groundwater abstraction. Then the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used to search for the Pareto-optimal solutions affected by different climate conditions. Results show that the river water level and groundwater abstraction schemes can be regulated to achieve the optimal tradeoffs among different objectives. To mitigate seawater intrusion, the impoundment river water level behind the dam adjacent to the seawater intrusion associated with years of insufficient precipitation should be raised by at least 0.5–1.5 m, while the river level behind the remaining dams should be reduced by at least 1 m. Moreover, under the constraint of restricting groundwater abstraction, the annual groundwater abstraction in the four county-level administrative subdomains should be adjusted by 1.2–1.5 million m^3 or more in years with less precipitation compared to that in years with more precipitation. The implications might also be applied to other coastal aquifers with intense human activities. 河道蓄水是沿海含水层中人工补给地下水的一种可行选择, 同时可缓解人类活动造成的海水入侵。本研究针对中国北方大沽河流域水资源短缺的现状, 提出了一个新的多目标优化框架, 用于优化管理该流域的现有多级拦河闸坝蓄水工程措施和地下水开采策略。该优化框架将一业已校准的数值模型与另一概化的河流子程序包进行耦合, 以模拟因河流蓄水而产生的大沽河-地下水的水力联系, 其重点关注最小化海水入侵程度、最小化河流渗流和最大化地下水允许开采量等3个目标之间的权衡关系。然后, 采用精英非支配排序的遗传算法(NSGA-II)来搜索优化模型在不同气候条件影响下的帕累托最优解。结果表明, 可通过调节河流蓄水位和地下水开采方案来实现不同目标之间的最佳权衡。为了缓解海水入侵, 在降水不足的年份, 靠近海水入侵区的闸坝至少要将其蓄水位提高0.5–1.5 m, 而其他闸坝则需将其蓄水位至少降低1 m。此外, 在地下水压采约束条件下, 4个县级行政分区的地下水年开采量在降水较少的年份应比降水较多的年份浮动120–150万m^3甚至更多。本文研究启示亦可适用于人类活动强烈的其他沿海含水层。 Los embalses fluviales son una alternativa a la recarga artificial de las aguas subterráneas en los acuíferos costeros, al tiempo que mitigan la intrusión de agua de mar causada por las actividades antropogénicas. Este estudio implementa un nuevo marco de optimización multiobjetivo para la gestión de las medidas de ingeniería existentes de embalses fluviales y estrategias de extracción de aguas subterráneas en la cuenca del río Dagu, una cuenca con escasez de agua en el norte de China.

Además, bajo la restricción de la extracción de aguas subterráneas, la extracción anual de aguas subterráneas en los cuatro subdominios administrativos a nivel de condado debería ajustarse en 1.2–1.5 millones de m^3 o más en los años con menos precipitaciones en comparación con los años con más precipitaciones.

A estrutura de otimização integra um modelo numérico calibrado com um pacote de rio conceituado para simular a interação entre o Rio Dagu e as águas subterrâneas devido ao represamento do rio, e se concentra na compensação entre minimizar a extensão da intrusão de água do mar, minimizar a infiltração do rio e maximizar captação de água subterrânea permitida. Em seguida, o elitista não dominado algoritmo genético de ordenação (NSGA-II) é usado para pesquisar as soluções ótimas de Pareto afetadas por diferentes condições climáticas.

Além disso, sob a restrição de restringir a captação de água subterrânea, a captação anual de água subterrânea nos quatro subdomínios administrativos de nível municipal deve ser ajustada em 1.2–1.5 milhões de m^3 ou mais em anos com menos precipitação em comparação com anos com mais precipitação.

The optimization is achieved through the coordinated response regulation of multi-energy reserve directly or indirectly connected by wind turbines or wind power stations, to realize the optimization of frequency regulation reserve costs under given frequency regulation response characteristics. First, the frequency regulation characteristics of wind turbines, energy storage systems, integrated energy loads and thermal power units are studied by establishing the wind power station system model with multi-frequency regulation reserve resources (MFRRR). The frequency regulation characteristics model of the MFRRR is established. Then, a reserve optimization strategy of wind power considering multi-type electric power system sources coordination is studied based on DPGMM-LSTM. Then, the frequency regulation reserve cost optimization model of MFRRR is established. The objective of the optimization model is to minimize the frequency regulation reserve cost of MFRRR.

  abstract     = {The design optimization of periodic lattice cellular structure relying exclusively on the computational simulation model is a time-consuming, even computationally prohibitive process. To relieve the computational burden, an efficient optimization method for periodic lattice cellular structure design based on the K-fold support vector regression model (K-SVR) is proposed in this paper. First, based on the loading experiments, the most promising unit cell of periodic lattice cellular structure is selected from five typical unit cells. Second, an initial SVR model is constructed to replace the simulation model of the periodic lattice cellular structure, and the K-fold cross-validation approach is used to extract the error information from the SVR model at the sample points. According to the error information, the sample points are sorted and classified into several sub-sets. Then, a global K-SVR model is re-constructed by aggregating each SVR model under each sub-set. Third, considering that there exists prediction errors between the K-SVR model and the simulation model, which may lead to infeasible optimal solutions, an uncertainty quantification approach is developed to ensure the feasibility of the optimal solution for the periodic lattice cellular structure design. Finally, the effectiveness and merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated on the design optimization of the A-pillar and seat-bottom frame.},

  abstract     = {Currently in our highly connected society, there is a strong requirement for decision-makers in organizations to coordinate and schedule their activities. Frequently, there are various uncertain factors, multiple objectives, many business knowledge and requirements, which heavily increase the difficulty of decision-making process regarding these issues. Therefore, a decision-maker will appreciate having control over the formulation of decision-making models and being able to adapt to highly dynamic situation. In this paper, we study a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to link the business requirement defined by a model with solution-oriented logical models, which are codes that could be submitted to a combinatorial optimization solver. The design of our proposal follows the principles of three-levels Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and is based on a cognitive process for decision-making systems. Then, several transformation rules between models are explained to realize automatic Model to Model Transformation (M2M) with a special emphasis on the Platform Independent Model (PIM) to Platform Specific Model (PSM) part. To make a proof of our model transformation chain efficiency, a classical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is chosen as a use case.},

When selecting promising individuals for exact evaluation, those with a large degree of uncertainty in approximation also need to be taken into account, which can strengthen the exploration ability of algorithms and improve the accuracy of surrogates. Support vector machine (SVM) is suitable for expensive small sample training set. However, it can only predict the mean value without the uncertainty. In order to solve this problem, the zero mean Gaussian random process is used to measure the uncertainty of support vector machine. The method’s efficiency is demonstrated on a set of benchmark problems. The results show that the uncertainty measurement method used in this paper improves the exploration ability of the evolutionary algorithm and obtains a better solution.},

This work presents a novel variant of GNDO, which is called elite-driven generalized normal distribution optimization (EDGNDO). EDGNDO enhances the global search ability of GNDO by the designed search mechanism consisting of three local search operators and three global search operators that are based on two built archives used to save elite individuals. Note that, EDGNDO only needs population size and termination criteria for optimization, which can distinguish it over the most reported metaheuristic methods. The performance of EDGNDO is investigated by the well-known CEC 2017 test suite including three unimodal functions and 27 multimodal functions. Experimental results demenstrate that EDGNDO is obviously better than GNDO and the other five powerful algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. In addition, EDGNDO is also used for solving four challenging constrained engineering design problems. Experimental results support the superiority of EDGNDO in solving the four problems. The superiority of EDGNDO in solving complex optimization problems is proven. The source code can be loaded from https://github.com/jsuzyy/EDGNDO .},

In this paper, based on multiple data sources, we proposed a research framework that integrates the topic model and social network perspective to analyze the topic evolution of a specific technology field. First, we introduced the best-performing BERT pre-trained model in the given field and the Bayesian Optimization method to improve the Combined Topic Model, which achieved the best result in promoting topic coherence so far. Then we used the Optimized Combined Topic Model (OCTM) to complete topic recognition. Second, we constructed the co-occurrence network among topics in the same time window with the topics as the nodes and calculated the co-occurrence coefficient of all topic pairs. Afterward, we combined the co-occurrence coefficient between topics in the same time window and the similarity between topics in the adjacent time window to determine the topic evolution type and identify the path. Third, we utilized the characteristics of the nodes in the network, such as harmonic closeness centrality and weighting degree, completed the weighting by the Criteria Importance Though Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method, and defined the importance index of each node in the undirected weighted network. Finally, according to the importance of nodes, the critical topic evolution paths were selected for specific analysis. We chose CRISPR technology as the empirical research field to preliminarily verify the operability and rationality of the method.},

The design variables are the positions and thicknesses of stiffening ribs and panels. Due to the large number of design variables, experience-based design may lead to a suboptimal result. Therefore, parametric optimization is adopted. Automatic variation of the position of structural elements is not straightforward, as geometrical interfaces between them must be adapted. For fast assessment of many variants, an automatic design procedure is proposed that includes (1) a parametric CAD model that automatically updates the interfaces between structural elements, (2) a finite element-based assessment of the quantities of interests, and (3) a systematic analysis of the relation between design variables and quantities of interest based on design of experiments. The finite element model adopts tetrahedral solid elements. Solids are numerically more expensive than shell elements, and tetrahedral elements are known to be of low accuracy. However, automatic meshing is now possible to enable a full-scale DoE analysis on a level of sufficient geometric detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the primary and support structure of the so-called Wide Field Imager of the ATHENA space program is analyzed and design improvements are presented.},

  abstract     = {We present an open-source Python framework for the shape optimization of complex shell structures using isogeometric analysis (IGA). IGA seamlessly integrates computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis models by employing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as basis functions, enabling the natural implementation of the Kirchhoff–Love shell model due to their higher order of continuity. We leverage the recently developed FEniCS-based analysis framework, PENGoLINS, for the direct structural analysis of shell structures consisting of a collection of NURBS patches through a penalty-based formulation. This contribution introduces the open-source implementation of gradient-based shape optimization for isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shells with a modular architecture. Complex shell structures with non-matching intersections are handled using a free-form deformation (FFD) approach and a moving intersections formulation. The symbolic differentiation and code generation capabilities in FEniCS are utilized to compute the analytical derivatives. By integrating FEniCS with OpenMDAO, we build modular components that facilitate gradient-based shape optimization of shell structures. The modular architecture in this work supports future extensions and integration with other disciplines and solvers, making it highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of applications. We validate the design-analysis-optimization workflow through several benchmark problems and demonstrate its application to aircraft wing design optimization.

  abstract     = {As a decision maker is not always interested in the entire Pareto front, a natural idea is to take into account user preferences in computationally expensive multi-objective optimization to focus on searching the preferred region. However, most existing methods rely on the estimated ideal point. Since the search process of preference-based approaches is always biased towards the region of interest (ROI), it is highly challenging to estimate the ideal point in preference-based expensive multi-objective optimization. Incorrect estimation of the ideal point may lead to the search direction being far away from the ROI and also result in normalization errors for each objective. This paper proposes a preference-based surrogate-assisted algorithm, PMEGO, to overcome this issue. In the preference management module, a set of new reference points derived from the user reference point is used to construct a series of subproblems, with the key merit of not using the ideal point. The Gaussian process model is built on the objective functions. In the model-based optimization, the projection distance with upper confidence bound (UCB) is developed as the fitness of solutions for each subproblem. Finally, the expected achievement scalarizing function improvement (EASFI) is employed to further screen out the best solutions for evaluation using the real objective functions. Comparative experiments are conducted on ZDT, DTLZ, SDTLZ, as well as two real-world applications. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared to three state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The surrogate-assisted optimization methods have attracted extensive attention as they can get satisfyingly optimal solutions in a limited computing resource. In this paper, we propose a two-stage infill strategy and surrogate-ensemble assisted optimization algorithm for solving expensive many-objective optimization problems. In this method, the population is optimized by a surrogate ensemble. Then a two-stage infill strategy is proposed to select individuals for real evaluations. The infill strategy considers individuals with better convergence or greater uncertainty. To calculate the uncertainty, we consider two aspects. One is the approximate variance of the current surrogate ensemble and the other one is the approximate variance of the historical surrogate ensemble. Finally, the population is revised by the recently updated surrogate ensemble. In experiments, we testify our method on two sets of many-objective benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving computationally expensive many-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Many optimization problems suffer from noise, and the noise combined with the large-scale attributes makes the problem complexity explode. Cooperative coevolution (CC) based on divide and conquer decomposes the problems and solves the sub-problems alternately, which is a popular framework for solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). Many studies show that the CC framework is sensitive to decomposition, and the high-accuracy decomposition methods such as differential grouping (DG), DG2, and recursive DG (RDG) are extremely sensitive to sampling accuracy, which will fail to detect the interactions in noisy environments. Therefore, solving LSOPs in noisy environments based on the CC framework faces unprecedented challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition method named linkage measurement minimization (LMM). We regard the decomposition problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and design the linkage measurement function (LMF) based on Linkage Identification by non-linearity check for real-coded GA (LINC-R). A detailed theoretical analysis explains why our proposal can determine the interactions in noisy environments. In the optimization, we introduce an advanced optimizer named modified differential evolution with distance-based selection (MDE-DS), and the various mutation strategy and distance-based selection endow MDE-DS with strong anti-noise ability. Numerical experiments show that our proposal is competitive with the state-of-the-art decomposition methods in noisy environments, and the introduction of MDE-DS can accelerate the optimization in noisy environments significantly.},

This study aims to lightweight the aluminum alloy steering knuckle while ensuring its critical performance indicators remain unaffected through advanced computer-aided design and simulation analysis techniques. A finite element model is developed and subjected to comprehensive simulations under realistic load conditions to evaluate strength, stiffness, modal characteristics, and fatigue durability. With weight minimization and first-order modal frequency maximization as objectives, through rigorous sensitivity analysis, the structural size parameters of the aluminum alloy steering knuckle that significantly influence the target responses, including weight, modal frequency, and stress distribution, were identified as design variables. Based on this, a high-precision response surface model was constructed, and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was integrated for multi-objective optimization design.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based global optimization (SBO) has gained rapid dominance in engineering design. However, traditional SBO method over entire design space with large size interval would be considerably time-consuming. In order to improve the optimization efficiency in SBO, an adaptive design space reconstruction (ADS) method based on fuzzy clustering method and effective sample points is proposed in this paper. Fuzzy c mean clustering method is applied to divide the initial design space into several sub-regions from which we choose the sub-region which is most likely to contain the global optima. During the optimization process, effective sample points are collected to be the center of new space constructed by trust region method, instead of a single sample point, to keep optimization from getting trapped in local minimums. Then the optimization search will be managed in the reconstructed promising sub-region. We test and verify the proposed method with the airfoil drag minimization problems proposed by Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG), which could demonstrate that better results can be obtained within the reconstructed design space with high efficiency.},

Employing the low computational complexity of recursive algorithms, some new schemes are developed for the parameter estimation of a class of time-varying systems. The temporal evolution of parameters is characterized through the autoregressive process, facilitating the construction of the identification model with regard to the autoregressive coefficients. Based on the computational efficiency of the gradient search, a parametric autoregression-based stochastic gradient algorithm is derived with an appropriate step size, achieving a compromise between the steepest descent and convergence rate. In order to address the limitation of the low estimation accuracy in gradient algorithms, a parametric autoregression-based multi-innovation stochastic gradient algorithm is explored by making use of the favorable information for corrections. The simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Therefore, for a class of time-varying systems whose parameters become the further insight through the autoregressive process, the proposed gradient methods can obtain the parameter estimates faster and more accurately while ensuring the real-time performance of time-varying systems.},

Previous studies have shown that different actions taken by various stakeholder groups at different stages of urban regeneration can affect the outcomes of urban regeneration. However, few studies have investigated the environmental impacts on the urban regeneration plots and their surroundings during the urban regeneration implementation stage under the leadership of different stakeholders. Therefore, this study selected 12 plots under three urban regeneration models—government-led, government-enterprise cooperation-led, and multi-stakeholder cooperation-led—and examined the median or mean values of land surface temperature, air temperature, carbon monoxide concentration, nitrogen dioxide concentration, and sulfur dioxide concentration for each season over four years, from pre-regeneration to the implementation stage. It analyzed the urban heat and pollution effects within the plots and in multiple ring buffer zones of 50 m, 150 m, and 350 m outside the plots. The results indicated that: (1) The land surface temperature within the plots was significantly influenced by urban regeneration, while the impact on air quality was not as noticeable; (2) During winter, the urban heat and pollution within the plots were least affected by the implementation of urban regeneration; (3) Urban regeneration models with government involvement as the leading party were more likely to mitigate the impact of urban regeneration project implementation on urban heat and pollution. These findings are of significant importance for furthering the sustainability of urban regeneration.},

The application of new technologies like blockchain can benefit sustainable energy supply chains by improving chain and logistics operations in the areas of trust, transparency and accountability, cooperation, information sharing, financial exchanges, and supply chain integration. However, the efforts to adopt such technologies in supply chains tend to face many challenges and challenges, which can seriously threaten their success. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine the challenges to blockchain technology application. This research focuses on identifying the criteria and challenges to the application of blockchain in renewable energy supply chains and also ranks the identified challenges in terms of their capacity to disrupt the process. The applicability of the suggested structure is examined in a case study of the renewable energy supply chain of Iran. In this study, the challenges are evaluated and ranked by the hybrid developed methods by the integration of the concept of gray numbers into the gray stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA-Gray) and the gray evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS-Gray). Another group of hybrid methods including the gray weighted sum method (WSM-Gray), the gray complex proportional assessment (COPRAS-Gray), and the gray technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS-Gray) is used to validate the results. The rankings obtained from all of these techniques show high degree of correlation. Among the identified challenges, “high investment cost” is found to be the most important challenge to the application of blockchain in sustainable energy supply chains.},

To make adoption successful, both the business as well as the technical perspectives must be carefully aligned. However, understanding the impact of the technological changes on business models is a challenge due to the technological complexity, the lack of knowledge in the organization, and regulatory requirements. Further, domain-specific modeling methods that inherently deal with blockchain concepts in business models are currently missing. To address this gap, we present an extension of the

  abstract     = {While the Internet of Energy (IoE) introduced advanced collaborative management methods through real-time monitoring and demand response programs, smart grids still grapple with challenges related to central governance, ineffective information aggregation, and privacy issues. These problems create significant hurdles in smart grid management, particularly with the high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). In this paper, we propose a Distributed Energy Trading Management ( DETM ) framework that combines a blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading system and an optimal power allocation model, ensuring grid stability. DETM focuses on the optimal power flow (OPF) problem for the day-ahead scheduling of dispatchable generators and DERs, taking into account the physical grid constraints. Moreover, the distribution network model interfaces with a prototyped blockchain platform, built using Ethereum Blockchain, to match supply and demand orders via smart contracts and to record transactions. DETM enables secure, transparent, and decentralized energy trading, thus overcoming the challenges of central governance and privacy. The experimental results show that our DETM framework significantly improves the efficiency of energy management and trading while ensuring the stability and security of the grid. The integration of blockchain technology with the power allocation model effectively eliminates information bottlenecks and promotes higher integration of DERs, demonstrating the substantial potential of DETM for future smart grid management.},

Currently, the blockchain is evaluated and applied by the academy in different application areas. These applications helped in the development of this technology, allowing it to be applied not only in traditional systems, but also in industrial processes. Despite its rapid technological advancement, and considering that the industrial environment presents great challenges and requirements that are different from traditional applications for human use, the definition of a blockchain network in the industrial environment becomes critical. Given this context, this work presents a step-by-step methodology that presents paths to be followed, and presents and discusses important aspects to be analyzed in order to define, implement and monitor a blockchain network in an industrial environment. Given the heterogeneity and complexity of blockchain systems, this methodology becomes essential to assist in the proper choice of platforms and parameters for blockchain networks, providing cost reduction and safety in the operation of sensitive industrial processes.},

A representation of a component, object or piece of machinery from the real world is known as the digital replica that is a Digital Twin (DT). It ensures secure and traceability, accessibility and immutable transaction and data provenance, we develop Dts using an approach based on blockchain. In this method smart contracts are used to track and save the actions of those involved in DT creation. The digital twins for costly gold jewelry is the method that has been used. The possibility of priceless jewelry being stolen or lost is very high. So, we came up with the concept of developing a distinct NFT for each item. As a result, each piece of jewelry will contain a special NFT token that will be linked to the original piece. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be duplicated. So only if anybody owns the NFT, the jewelry belongs to them. Even if the jewelry is lost or stolen, a public address will be needed to sell the jewelry so nobody can’t sell it without the jewelry owner’s knowledge. In every piece of jewelry, the NFT will be engraved into the jewelry and also an Ethereum wallet will be created and a public address will also be allocated to the jewelry owner. When person A is selling a piece of jewelry to person B, all the NFT ownership has to be transferred to person B. This system is secured because the NFT Ownership is something which can’t be stolen. After all, it is not a real asset.},

However, existing solutions come with downsides regarding throughput scalability, latency, and suboptimal tradeoffs between confidentiality and transparency. To address these issues, we propose to change the foundation of blockchain-based process enactment: from on-chain smart contracts to state channels , an overlay network on top of a blockchain. State channels allow conducting most transactions off-chain while mostly retaining the core security properties offered by blockchain. Our proposal, process channels , is a model-driven approach to enacting processes on state channels, with the aim to retain the desired blockchain properties while reducing the on-chain footprint as much as possible. We here focus on the principled approach of state channels as a platform , to enable manifold future optimizations in various directions, like latency and confidentiality. We implement our approach prototypical and evaluate it both qualitatively (w.r.t. assumptions and guarantees) and quantitatively (w.r.t. correctness and gas cost). In short, while the initial deployment effort is higher with state channels, it typically pays off after a few process instances—considerably reducing cost. And as long as the new assumptions hold, so do the guarantees.},

A prototyping methodology grounded in constructivist principles validates the approach. The primary contribution is a distributed simulator for Reference Nets as an extension of Renew . The simulator leverages KafkaRegistry to facilitate event-driven, loosely coupled communication. This architecture enhances scalability and robustness, tackling computational challenges in modern distributed systems. The proposed solution overcomes bottlenecks of single-platform simulations.

  abstract     = {The communication and computation world is being gone through a lack of proper power consumption models in multi-tier small cell-based heterogeneous networks. Efficient spectrum utilization with proper task distribution is an emerging criterion for 5G-based wireless communication. Delay incurred by task offloading degrades the quality of services (QoS). To reduce power consumption, delay, and increase spectral efficiency, fog-based power-efficient beam allocation and task distribution model for IoT network are proposed. Femtolet acts as a base station and performs also computational assignments like a cloudlet. Hence, femtolet can act as a fog device. Femtolet allocates beam to each IoT device based on maximum spectral efficiency. Secondly, the task distribution is performed. If the femtolet itself can perform tasks, it processes them and sends back to the IoT device. The global femtolet concept appears when two or more femtolets are needed to perform tasks. The connection between IoT devices (IoTD) and femtolet is done by 5G beamforming. Mixed integer linear programming is formulated. Power consumption, delay, and spectral efficiency are the QoS factors of the IoT network.

  abstract     = {Large-scale, fault-tolerant, distributed systems are the backbone for many critical software services. Since they must execute correctly in a possibly adversarial environment with arbitrary communication delays and failures, the underlying algorithms are intricate. In particular, achieving consistency and data retention relies on intricate consensus (state machine replication) protocols. Ensuring the reliability of implementations of such protocols remains a significant challenge because of the enormous number of exceptional conditions that may arise in production. We propose a methodology and a tool called Netrix for testing such implementations that aims to exploit programmer’s knowledge to improve coverage, enables robust bug reproduction, and can be used in regression testing across different versions of an implementation. As evaluation, we apply our tool to a popular proof of stake blockchain protocol, Tendermint, which relies on a Byzantine consensus algorithm, a benign consensus algorithm, Raft, and BFT-Smart. We were able to identify deviations of the implementation from the protocol specification and validate corrections on an updated implementation. Additionally, we were able to confirm the presence of known bugs in previous versions.},

  abstract     = {Verifying industrial robotic systems is a complex task because those systems are distributed and solely defined by their implementation instead of models of the system to be verified. Some technologies mitigate parts of this problem, e.g., robotic middleware such as the Robotic Operating System (ROS) or concrete solutions such as automata-based specification of robot behavior. However, they all lack the required modeling depth to describe the structure, behavior, and communication of the system. We introduce an improved version of our previous model-driven approach based on Petri nets, integrating these three aspects of ROS-based systems. Using a formal modeling language enables verification of the described system and the generation of complete system parts in the form of ROS nodes. This reduces testing effort because the specification of component workflows and interfaces remains formally proven, while only changed implementations have to be revalidated. We extended our previous approach with novel model transformations, which considerably improved our approach’s performance and memory requirements. We evaluate our approach in a case study involving multiple industrial robotic arms and show that the structure of and communication between ROS nodes can be described and verified.},

  abstract     = {陆地生态系统是地球系统的重要组成部分,由于全球变暖,陆地生态系统正经历着显著的变化。本文利用中国科学院地球系统模式第二版(CAS-ESM2)中的新版全球植被动力学模型,研究了陆地植被分布和碳通量对未来全球变暖的响应变化。本文做了两组试验:当代试验和未来试验。它们分别对应1981–2000年的当代气候和CMIP5 RCP8.5模拟的2081–2100年的未来气候。同时,为排除CO2施肥效应的影响,所有模拟试验中CO2浓度都设为恒定值。模拟结果表明,全球变暖将导致植被覆盖度总体增加,这是中高纬度地区植被增加和热带地区植被减少的综合结果;另外,碳通量(包括总初级生产力、净初级生产力和自养呼吸)也将随全球变暖有所增加。研究发现,植被覆盖度的变化与地表气温的变化存在显著的相关性,这表明温度对未来植被分布起主导作用,而碳通量的变化则是叶面积指数、温度和降水共同作用的结果。本文应用CAS-ESM2研究陆地生态系统对未来气候变暖的响应,尽管剔除CO2施肥效应会对研究结果产生一定的限制,但本文研究仍有利于更好地理解植被过程,并进一步改进模型的参数化 Terrestrial ecosystems are an important part of Earth systems, and they are undergoing remarkable changes in response to global warming. This study investigates the response of the terrestrial vegetation distribution and carbon fluxes to global warming by using the new dynamic global vegetation model in the second version of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Earth System Model (CAS-ESM2). We conducted two sets of simulations, a present-day simulation and a future simulation, which were forced by the present-day climate during 1981–2000 and the future climate during 2081–2100, respectively, as derived from RCP8.5 outputs in CMIP5. CO_2 concentration is kept constant in all simulations to isolate CO_2-fertilization effects. The results show an overall increase in vegetation coverage in response to global warming, which is the net result of the greening in the mid-high latitudes and the browning in the tropics. The results also show an enhancement in carbon fluxes in response to global warming, including gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, and autotrophic respiration. We found that the changes in vegetation coverage were significantly correlated with changes in surface air temperature, reflecting the dominant role of temperature, while the changes in carbon fluxes were caused by the combined effects of leaf area index, temperature, and precipitation. This study applies the CAS-ESM2 to investigate the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming. Even though the interpretation of the results is limited by isolating CO_2-fertilization effects, this application is still beneficial for adding to our understanding of vegetation processes and to further improve upon model parameterizations.},

Statecharts can be integrated using various composition modes (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous) and then automatically mapped into the inputs of model checker back-ends, namely UPPAAL, Theta and Spin. The model checkers generate tests by traversing the emergent analysis models to cover the elements of the test model as specified by pattern-based model queries. The returned diagnostic traces are then concretized to different execution environments. The approach is implemented in our open source Gamma Statechart Composition Framework and evaluated on a distributed RIS subsystem under development.},

  abstract     = {Software companies frequently customize and extend product lines in multiple projects concurrently to quickly deliver solutions to customers. Engineers use a distributed and feature-oriented development process, commonly supported by version control systems to track implementation-level changes. For instance, feature branches are widely used to add new or modify existing features. However, when merging back features to the product line, the information about feature-to-code mappings is usually lost. Furthermore, the granularity of merging is limited to branches, making it hard to extract and merge selected individual features from one product to another. This paper thus presents feature-oriented clone and pull operations for distributed development, which are implemented in the FORCE^2 platform. Our evaluation uses variants of the ArgoUML product line to investigate the correctness and performance of our approach. The results show that the feature-oriented operations work with high precision and recall for different cases of feature interactions, also when feature implementations are scattered across many locations in the source code. The performance measurements demonstrate that the operations can be integrated in the typical workflows of engineers.},

With the development of various technologies in the information age, the traditional method of engineering project documentation is no longer suitable for the needs of the new era. The main purpose of this paper is to carry out research on the design of power transmission and transformation engineering management system on the basis of distributed load balancing. This paper mainly conducts an in-depth study on the construction process of power transmission and transformation projects. Combined with the characteristics of power transmission and transformation project file management, the load balancing scheduling algorithm is improved.

  abstract     = {Prediction models often fail if train and test data do not stem from the same distribution. Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen, perturbed test data is a desirable but difficult-to-achieve property for prediction models and in general requires strong assumptions on the data generating process (DGP). In a causally inspired perspective on OOD generalization, the test data arise from a specific class of interventions on exogenous random variables of the DGP, called anchors. Anchor regression models, introduced by Rothenhäusler et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser B 83(2):215–246, 2021. https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12398 ), protect against distributional shifts in the test data by employing causal regularization. However, so far anchor regression has only been used with a squared-error loss which is inapplicable to common responses such as censored continuous or ordinal data. Here, we propose a distributional version of anchor regression which generalizes the method to potentially censored responses with at least an ordered sample space. To this end, we combine a flexible class of parametric transformation models for distributional regression with an appropriate causal regularizer under a more general notion of residuals. In an exemplary application and several simulation scenarios we demonstrate the extent to which OOD generalization is possible.},

  abstract     = {Rolling bearings are of great importance in all areas of mechanical engineering due to their precise and low-friction guidance of rotating components at low cost. The design of rolling bearing arrangements is usually based on approximately ideal geometries of bearings and adjacent parts on which the bearing seats are located. However, real components inevitably show statistically distributed deviations from their nominal shapes, which are limited by tolerances. Tight tolerances result in high manufacturing costs while on the other hand their expansion leads to an increase of occurring geometrical deviations which cause changes in the bearing-internal contact and load conditions and can thus impair the operating behavior of the bearing, e.g. with regard to fatigue life, frictional torque or vibration behavior. By taking these effects into account in the design stage, potential problems in operation can be identified early during development and countermeasures can be taken, e.g. by adjusting bearing and seat tolerances. This enables an improvement of overall product quality and a reduction of costs. This paper presents a method for the integration of component deviations in the computation of the fatigue life ( L _ n m r ) and dynamic behavior of cylindrical roller bearing arrangements—both of which are crucial design criteria—based on a combination of statistical tolerance analysis and multi-body simulations. The method is applied to an exemplary use case for illustration. Wälzlager sind auf allen Gebieten des Maschinenbaus aufgrund ihrer präzisen und reibungsarmen Führung rotierender Bauteile bei gleichzeitig geringen Kosten von großer Bedeutung. In der Regel werden bei der Auslegung von Wälzlagerungen näherungsweise ideale Geometrien der Lager und ihrer Sitzflächen zugrunde gelegt. Reale Bauteile weisen jedoch unvermeidlich statistisch verteilte Abweichungen von ihrer nominalen Gestalt auf, welche durch Toleranzen begrenzt werden. Enge Toleranzen haben dabei einen hohen Fertigungsaufwand zur Folge, andererseits nehmen bei deren Erweiterung die auftretenden geometrischen Abweichungen zu, was zu Veränderungen der lagerinternen Kontakt- und Lastverhältnisse führt und somit das Betriebsverhalten des Lagers z. B. hinsichtlich Ermüdungslebensdauer, Reibmoment und Schwingungsverhalten beeinträchtigen kann. Durch Berücksichtigung dieser Effekte bei der Auslegung von Wälzlagerungen können potenzielle Probleme im Betrieb bereits in der Entwicklungsphase erkannt und entsprechende Abhilfemaßnahmen, z. B. durch Anpassung der Toleranzen von Lagern und Lagersitzen, ergriffen werden. Somit können eine Verbesserung der Produktqualität erzielt und entstehende Kosten reduziert werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt eine Methode zur Integration von abweichungsbehafteten Bauteilgeometrien bei der computergestützten Berechnung der Ermüdungslebensdauer ( L _ n m r ) sowie des dynamischen Betriebsverhaltens von Zylinderrollenlagerungen vor, welche essentielle Kriterien bei der Auslegung darstellen. Diese basiert auf einer Kombination von statistischen Toleranzanalysen und Mehrkörpersimulationen. Ihre Anwendung wird an einem beispielhaften Anwendungsfall demonstriert.},

In view of the above problems, a hierarchical control strategy by coordinating the distributed wind turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) is presented to improve the transient frequency (TF) and steady-state frequency (SSF). For the system control level, the optimal frequency regulation coefficients of multiple WTs and PVs clustering systems are determined by the optimal control principle with minimum frequency regulation energy, while considering the constraints of TF and SSF. For the WT/PV control level, the frequency regulation coefficients of WTs and PVs are solved by the model predictive controller (MPC) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with the minimum control cost of WT and PV. It achieves the optimal allocation of frequency regulation power and improves the computing efficiency. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is tested in the modified IEEE 10-machine 39-bus system.},

  abstract     = {Stream processing applications deal with millions of data items continuously generated over time. Often, they must be processed in real-time and scale performance, which requires the use of distributed parallel computing resources. In C/C++, the current state-of-the-art for distributed architectures and High-Performance Computing is Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, exploiting stream parallelism using MPI is complex and error-prone because it exposes many low-level details to the programmer. In this work, we introduce a new parallel programming abstraction for implementing distributed stream parallelism named DSParLib. Our abstraction of MPI simplifies parallel programming by providing a pattern-based and building block-oriented development to inter-connect, model, and parallelize data streams found in modern applications. Experiments conducted with five different stream processing applications and the representative PARSEC Ferret benchmark revealed that DSParLib is efficient and flexible. Also, DSParLib achieved similar or better performance, required less coding, and provided simpler abstractions to express parallelism with respect to handwritten MPI programs.},

The applied methodology utilizes the load flow study module of the PSS/E software, in conjunction with developed Python algorithms to study several studies over 24-h periods. The main parameters analyzed include: the number of clients with a connected PV system, customer-installed power, and load profiles of all clients connected to the same source. Furthermore, two battery energy storage strategies have been examined: centralized energy storage and distributed energy storage. An independent voltage control has been implemented to assess the benefits of PV systems. The obtained results contribute to ongoing efforts toward more sustainable and efficient distribution energy systems and provide valuable insights to overcome barriers to DER penetration in low-voltage distribution networks.},

  abstract     = {The request for quickly available forecasts of intense weather and marine events impacting coastal areas is gradually increasing. High-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence techniques are crucial in this application. Risk mitigation and coastal management must design scientific workflow appropriately and maintain them continuously updated and operational. Climate change accelerating increase trend of the past decades impacted on sea-level rise, together with broader factors such as geostatic effects and subsidence, reducing the effectiveness of coastal defenses. Due to this, the support tools, such as Early Warning Systems, have become increasingly more valuable because they can process data promptly and provide valuable indications for mitigation proposals. We developed the Shoreline Alert Model (SAM), an operational Python tool that produces simulation scenarios, ‘what-if’ assumptions, and coastal flooding forecasts to fill this gap in our study area. SAM aims to provide decision-makers, scientists, and engineers with new tools to help forecast significant weather-marine events and support related management or emergency responses. SAM aims to fill the gap between the wind-driven wave models, which produce simulations and forecasts of waves of significant height, period, and direction in deep or mid-water, and the run-up local models, which exstimulate marine ingression in the event of intense weather phenomena. It employs a parallelization scheme that allows users to run it on heterogeneous parallel architectures. It produced results approximately 24 times faster than the baseline when using shared memory with distributed memory, processing roughly 20,000 coastal cross-shore profiles along the coastline of the Campania region (Italy). Increasing the performance of this model and, at the same time, honoring the need for relatively modest HPC resources will enable the local manager and policymakers to enforce fast and effective responses to intense weather phenomena.},

Due to their fundamental position in knowledge graph querying, RPQs have become the focus of extensive research efforts.

To address this gap, LD-RPQB constructs a synthetic data graph built upon the SP

In addition, LD-RPQB incorporates 12 query templates derived from both a statistical analysis of real-world corpora and a review of existing research on RPQs. This combination ensures that the benchmark is both scalable and representative of typical query workloads encountered in practical applications.

But these assumptions of normality and no serial correlation are hardly met in real life. Hence, this study considers the linear regression time series model for series with outliers and autocorrelated errors. These autocorrelated errors are represented by a covariance-stationary autoregressive process where the independent innovations are driven by shape mixture of skew- t normal distribution. The shape mixture of skew- t normal distribution is a flexible extension of the skew- t normal with an additional shape parameter that controls skewness and kurtosis. With this error model, stochastic modeling of multiple outliers is possible with an adaptive robust maximum likelihood estimation of all the parameters. An Expectation Conditional Maximization Either algorithm is developed to carryout the maximum likelihood estimation. We derive asymptotic standard errors of the estimators through an information-based approximation.

Due to the diversity of cloud service providers, their heterogeneity and the exponential growth of offered services, user requirements cannot be adequately met. These problems, if not addressed effectively, can have a negative impact on the cloud environment as well as on the user experience. Thus, to answer the service management problem in multi-cloud environments, we propose in this paper a threefold contribution (i) a noval cloud federation architecture, (ii) a suitable service management system and (iii) a service publication algorithm in order to manage, store and retrieve efficiently cloud services within the federation. Our solution consists in combining several concepts including trust, clustering and , ontologies. Our aim is to automate the management process, maximise the profit and ensure a better user experience.

  abstract     = {Agent-based and individual-based modeling have been widely used to simulate ecological systems. The historical architectures designed to artificial life simulation, namely LIDA and MicroPsy, rely into classical concurrence mechanisms based on threads, shared memory and locks. Although these mechanisms seem to work fine for many multi-agent systems (MAS), notably for those requiring synchronous communication between agents, they present severe restrictions in case of complex asynchronous MAS. In this work, we explore an alternative approach to handle concurrency in distributed asynchronous MAS: the actor model. An actor is a concurrent entity capable of sending, receiving and handling asynchronous messages, and creating new actors. Within this paradigm, there are no shared memory and, hence, no data race conditions. We introduce L2L (a short for: Learn to Live, Live to Learn) architecture, a biological inspired distributed non-deterministic MAS simulation framework, in which the autonomous agents (creatures) are endowed with a functional and minimal nervous system model enabling them to learn from its own experiences and interactions with the two-dimensional world, populated with creatures and nutrients. Both creatures and nutrients are encapsulated in actors. The system as a whole performs as a discrete non-deterministic dynamical system, as well as the creatures themselves. The scalability of this actor-based framework is evaluated showing the system scales up and out − many processes per processor node and in a computer cluster. A second experiment is realized to validate the architecture, consisting of an open-ended foraging simulation with both one or many creatures and hundreds of nutrients. Results from this specific actor-based version are compared to those from a classical concurrency version of the same architecture, showing they are equivalent, despite the fact that the former version scales a lot better. Moreover, results show that exploration of the world is unbiased, leading us to conjecture that our system follows ergodic hypothesis. We argue that the actor-based model proves to be very promising to modeling of asynchronous complex MAS.},

The IEEE 1516 Standard for Modeling and Simulation High Level Architecture is an example of a holistic implementation of an ontology-based approach to agent-based modeling. This work is devoted to a multiagent modeling system designed for modeling complex radio engineering systems (especially radar systems). This is relevant due to the need to replace part of the field tests of radio engineering systems with simulation experiments. One motivation for switching to the IEEE 1516 standard for a heavy multiagent modeling system, among others, is to ensure scalability, openness, and the multiple reuse of the developed agent models, which is completely logical, based on the existing well-developed and proven standard establishing rules for the interaction of models and the development of software interfaces. The general principles of the construction and architecture of the modeling system are given. The basic requirements for the main modeling agents and their role and place in the complex modeling system are shown, a special place among which is occupied by the simulator of the background-target environment. The possibility of combining two simulation schemes is also discussed: discrete-event and step-by-step. The fact is that the step-by-step scheme has the advantages of simplicity and clarity, and it is convenient to model processing algorithms and components of radio engineering systems. However, it is impossible to implement true autonomy and asynchrony of agents in it. Combining two modeling schemes allows you to combine their advantages.},

  abstract     = {Fault tolerance is essential for the correct execution of large distributed simulations of discrete event systems, as the likelihood of faults increases with the size of the cloud infrastructure used. Achieving optimal performance and cost in a fault-tolerant distributed simulation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a replication-based approach in a conservative distributed simulation strategy that is specifically designed to minimize latency introduced by fault tolerance mechanisms. Unlike traditional replication methods, our method is tailored for conservative simulation, leveraging simulation messages and timing to maintain consistency while decoupling replica execution. As a result, our approach reduces the need for messaging and synchronization and maintains eventual consistency windows with low latency overhead, achieving near-nominal simulation performance in the absence of faults. If replicas have similar performance, memory usage can be lower compared to optimistic approaches, and recovery can be fast following a node failure, despite asynchronous replication. Experimental results show that without faults, the performance of a distributed simulator with fault management is similar to one without it. Recovery from a fault reveals that the main overhead is in replica provisioning, with minimal overhead for synchronization.},

Building upon the Internet of Production Alliance (IoPA) work, this article explores how integrating OKRF and SCIS can enhance production flexibility and efficiency through substitutability and resource repurposing strategies. The OKRF-SCIS integration exhibits the potential to enhance Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) by empowering organizations to adapt to fluctuating demand and availability through adaptability strategies such as supplier/product substitution and resource repurposing. While this study primarily focuses on the conceptual design of OKRF and SCIS, further empirical research is needed to validate its effectiveness. Additionally, investigating the framework’s applicability across various industries and contexts would provide valuable insights. The integration of OKRF and SCIS can enable organizations to optimize supply chain operations, enhancing resilience and facilitating adaptation to changing demands through seamless substitutability and resource repurposing. This integration can also reduce transportation costs and increase responsiveness to local demand. Furthermore, it can enhance SCR and promote sustainable, resilient supply chain ecosystems by improving data transparency and resource utilization efficiency. This paper illustrates the potential of OKRF and SCIS in healthcare supply chains.},

The new method is employed to solve aeroelastic multiobjective optimisation of an aircraft wing which optimises structural weight and flutter speed. Design variables in the aeroelastic design problem include thicknesses of ribs, spars and composite layers. Also, the ply orientation of the upper and lower composite skins are assigned as the design variables. Additional benchmark test problems are also use to validate the search performance of the proposed algorithm. The performance validation reveals that the proposed optimiser is among the state-of-the-art multiobjective meta-heuristics. The concept of using estimation of distribution algorithm for tuning meta-heuristic control parameters is efficient and effective and becomes a new direction for improving MH performance.},

We confront two challenges: one is the absence of prior knowledge in sensor statistics, including measurement noise, target detection probabilities, and clutter rates; the other is the need to improve both tracking accuracy and computational efficiency simultaneously. The proposed approach introduces an enhanced measurement preprocessing framework that transforms raw multi-sensor data into synthetic pseudo-likelihood measurements via a sampling clustering (SC) algorithm. First, the average distance derived from a distance matrix is utilized to identify measurement subsets generated by potential targets. Subsequently, non-empty and overlapping measurement subsets are adaptively merged to form distinct clusters, while the cluster centroids are determined based on the inferred target cardinality. These cluster centroids, acting as proxy measurements, are then integrated into a reformulated probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter update equation to estimate target states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior tracking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to advanced distributed PHD filters, particularly in scenarios with unknown sensor statistics and dense clutter.},

  abstract     = {With contraction of agricultural resources and deterioration of ecological environment, grain production has faced a series challenges. Therefore, figuring out grain production efficiency (GPE) has significance to green and sustainable development of grain production. We constructed the global epsilon-based measure (EBM) model to estimate GPE of 100 prefecture-level cities in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2020. Further, we studied dynamic evolution of GPE in the YRB by utilizing the dynamic distribution method. The following results were revealed. First, aggregate level of GPE in the YRB was low, with an average value of 0.429, but showed a growing tendency in general. Second, the GPE in downstream was higher than that in upstream and midstream. The GPE in each region showed an increasing trend with fluctuation over time. Third, the GPE in the YRB tended to converge to a medium–high level. Compared with the high-efficiency cities, the distribution mobility was strong cities with high GPE possessed strong distribution mobility. By comparison, the low-efficiency cities had the phenomenon of “poverty trap”, the vicious circle of low-level GPE was difficult to break. Under the background of promoting agricultural green development comprehensively, constructing GPE model considering non-point source pollution has important and practical meaning for solving problem of current agricultural pollution and guaranteeing food security. Meanwhile, analysis of spatial distribution, trends of distribution, and evolution of GPE can also provide regional experience reference for government to ensure coordinated development of grain production and ecological environment.},

  abstract     = {Traditional droop control methods are difficult to achieve accurate and autonomous current sharing between micro-source converters in DC microgrid, due to the mismatch of line impedance and the existence of low-speed communication. In this paper, an autonomous current sharing control strategy based on active frequency injection and line impedance compensation is proposed. Firstly, an active frequency injection method is used for all supported voltage-source converters. Under the feedback mechanism of the reactive power and voltage, the accurate current sharing can be achieved, and the total equivalent droop coefficient of each converter would be approximately equal. On the basis, the line impedance compensation information of each converter can be obtained accurately. Then, the original droop control method, in which the droop coefficient is the obtained compensation value, is utilized to replace the injection method. Without introducing any communication, this method not only can ensure the accuracy of load current sharing, but also can effectively improve the large ripple problem caused by frequency injection method, and avoid the secondary bus voltage drop. The design process and stability of the controller are analyzed in detail. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy are verified by using the corresponding simulation model and HIL experimental platform.},

  abstract     = {Evidence shows that physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. A growing variety of behavioural change interventions have been developed to promote physical activity behaviour, and have shown success. However, most of these apps apply a one-size-fits-all approach focusing on individualistic cultures and neglecting collectivist cultures. We investigate the possible cultural differences between individualism and collectivism on how the behavioral determinants influence people’s physical activity behaviour. We conducted a large-scale study of 430 participants from collectivist and individualist cultures using the extended Health Belief Model (HBM). We also assess the moderating effect of age and gender. We map these determinants to their corresponding persuasive strategies that can be used in operationalizing them in behaviour change applications for promoting physical activity. Our findings show that Social influence and Cue to action are the strongest determinants of physical activity for collectivists. Whereas in individualists, Cue to action, and Self-efficacy are the strongest determinants of physical activity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and offer design guidelines for persuasive interventions that both appeal to a broad audience and are tailored to a particular group depending on their gender and age group.},

In this context, the paper presents an integrated solution to formally define system requirements and automate their verification through simulation.

However, collecting large-scale datasets for training and calibrating hyperparameters remains a considerable challenge due to the high complexity of polymer-related experiments and simulations. This study employs the Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression (PIGPR) method to construct a predictive model driven by limited data, based on the interactions between polymers and their properties. It integrates prior knowledge from both macroscopic and microscopic rheological physics models of polymers, formulating the regression problem within a multi-task learning framework. This framework combines experimental measurement data with targets derived from physical models to optimize the kernel function’s hyperparameters, using prior knowledge to define the mean function. Experimental results indicate that the PIGPR effectively facilitates Bayesian inference with fewer data points, providing an efficient approach for domains where measurements are expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, the model delivered predictions for the rheological properties of carbon fiber spinning solutions that closely matched both experimental and simulated data, validating its effectiveness. The integration of physical information demonstrates strong fitting, interpretability, and extrapolation capabilities, offering robust guidance for subsequent experimental design and simulation efforts.},

There have been some attempts to provide specification languages that enable more explicit reference to the behaviour of cyber components, but it remains awkward to directly express the behaviour of both cyber and physical components in the same specification, using one formalism. In this paper, we introduce a new specification language, Source Code and Signal Logic (SCSL), that 1) provides syntax specific to both signals and events originating in source code; and 2) does not require source code events to be abstracted into signals. We introduce SCSL by giving its syntax and semantics, along with examples. We then provide a comparison between SCSL and existing specification languages, using an example property, to show the benefit of using SCSL to capture certain types of properties.},

  abstract     = {Given the tremendous growth of the microelectronics industry in recent years, soldering efficiency is more crucial than ever. Despite the great importance of the solder joints, these interconnections happen to be the weakest link in electronic packaging. Many surveys have been carried out in order to investigate their thermomechanical reliability but still incomplete since the electro-thermomechanical reliability is the one encountered in real operational services. A thorough insight into the multiphysics behavior of Pb-free solder joints is fundamental to enhancing the operational efficiency since the extent of their deterioration is a significant function of their compositions. This article investigates the response of various solder alloys (Sn63Pb37, SAC105, SAC305, SAC405, and InnoLot) to electrothermal loadings. The study explores their performance under different temperature conditions and examines factors such as melting temperature variations, residual stresses, and the impact of the IMC layer. The results highlight the superior reliability of SAC405, particularly regarding inelastic strain and premature damage. The study underscores the significance of mitigating these factors during electronics design and manufacturing to enhance solder joint lifetime. The findings contribute to advancing solder alloy reliability and improving electronic system performance.},

Today, distance education can rely on more and more sophisticated tools and technologies. However, one may wonder if this is enough to cover all the dimensions of learning. We will argue that non-verbal communication is necessary to promote learning and thus guarantee the quality of teaching and the commitment of the learners. To this end, we believe it is appropriate to start a reflection on this subject and to try to provide an answer to the following research question: how can distance education compensate for the lack of the physical and human dimension of communication? The aim of this paper is to present the first results of our reflections. Based on work in the fields of educational science, ergonomics and human-machine interaction, we propose a model-driven approach that is independent of any technological platform. This approach can be instantiated and adapted to different learning situations.},

However, it is leading to increasing human factor vulnerabilities exposure and now necessitating a move to an integrated human-centric approach involving security, sustainability assurance and safety to transform humans from the perceived weakest link to the strongest (Kaspersky Blog in The human factor in IT security: how employees are making businesses vulnerable from within, 2017; Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) in Toward realization of the new economy and society—reform of the economy and society by the deepening of ‘Society 5.0’, 2016). Based on Riley’s 2014 cyber terrain operational stack (CTOS) (Riley in “Cyber Terrain”: a model for increased understanding of cyber activity, 2014), this paper uses case studies to develop and combine an integrated human-centric view with an algorithmic-centric risk management methodology for a hybrid approach in cyber-physical environments. This methodology builds on from the original security triad's evolution (Boyes in Technol Innov Manag Rev 5:28–34, 2015) and aligns with potential new Security, Sustainability, Assurance and Safety (S2AS) risk management atomic attributes, providing an integrated framework for managing risks in cyber-physical ecosystems. The proposed integrated risk management framework potentially can be associated with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), linking S2AS risk atomic attributes to identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are characterized with their concurrency, heterogeneity and time sensitivity. In this context, it is crucial to have self-adaptive CPS systems in order to manage changing in their internal and external environment and supporting new requirements. Also, CPS systems are known with their restricted connectivity, and consequently, they must perform a decentralized adaptation. This is added to the general complexity of modeling the adaptation process. In fact, the MAPE-K (Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Execution and Knowledge) control loop model has been identified as a crucial element for realizing self-adaptation in software systems. To respond to the design challenge of self-adaptive CPS, we propose a set of decentralized MAPE-K design patterns to help designer in building such complex systems thanks to software design patterns which provide a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. In this paper, we provide a set of decentralized patterns to model CPS using the refinement technique. For this purpose, we proposed a standard notation based on the UML modeling language to describe the different MAPE-K patterns for decentralized control in self-adaptive CPS. We illustrate our approach by modeling the smart parking application using the coordinated control pattern.},

  abstract     = {Since the resin-based composite materials are of essential importance in many key engineering fields, the manufacture processes are highly worth studying and optimizing for satisfying quality control at the highest possible production rate. In this paper, combined with the impregnation theory, the flow-thermal-mechanical multiphysics coupling model is built to characterize, investigate and optimize the osmotic flow process of hot-melt resin in fiber fabrics with the uniformity and adequacy of resin impregnation as the evaluation criteria. First, the osmotic flow process is characterized by the osmotic flow front of resin, which is tracked by the phase-field method. Then, the influencing factors of roller clearance, temperature and speed are comprehensively investigated. After that, the simulation data of resin impregnation degree are fitted by polynomial curves, with accuracy up to 96.13},

  abstract     = {A conceptual framework has a central role in the scientific process. Its purpose is to synthesize evidence, assist in understanding phenomena, inform future research and act as a reference operational guide in practical settings. We propose an updated conceptual framework intended to facilitate the validation and interpretation of physical training measures. This revised conceptual framework was constructed through a process of qualitative analysis involving a synthesis of the literature, analysis and integration with existing frameworks (Banister and PerPot models). We identified, expanded, and integrated four constructs that are important in the conceptualization of the process and outcomes of physical training. These are: (1) formal introduction of a new measurable component ‘training effects’, a higher-order construct resulting from the combined effect of four possible responses (acute and chronic, positive and negative); (2) explanation, clarification and examples of training effect measures such as performance, physiological, subjective and other measures (cognitive, biomechanical, etc.); (3) integration of the sport performance outcome continuum (from performance improvements to overtraining); (4) extension and definition of the network of linkages (uni and bidirectional) between individual and contextual factors and other constructs. Additionally, we provided constitutive and operational definitions, and examples of theoretical and practical applications of the framework. These include validation and conceptualization of constructs (e.g., performance readiness), and understanding of higher-order constructs, such as training tolerance, when monitoring training to adapt it to individual responses and effects. This proposed conceptual framework provides an overarching model that may help understand and guide the development, validation, implementation and interpretation of measures used for athlete monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Development strategies related to the Web of Things (WoT) must address the implementation of specific software artifacts that enable the realization of a WoT architecture and allow things to be executed. These artifacts, named servients , act as a client, a server, or with both roles for interaction with real or virtual devices, i.e. , things. In this sense, servients can expose things, consume things, or are intermediaries if they perform both actions. Consequently, servients may include a mechanism for supporting different protocols and communication patterns. This paper presents an approach to implement lightweight WoT servients by reducing the implementation related to the communication protocols of a thing. These servients do not contain any server to expose their interaction affordances; instead, they only contain clients of intermediary brokers that enable communication. Our proposal has been validated with an example scenario consisting of a set of interconnected devices. This scenario includes the integration of real and virtual devices.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years the use of IoT devices has grown exponentially. When it comes to working with them, we find a series of problems that are not easy to solve. On the one hand, the simple fact of communicating with those devices can be problematic since they can use different types of technologies regarding that communication. On the other hand, these types of devices usually aim to perform their function using the lowest possible energy, meaning they have certain constraints in terms of performance. Trying to work with these devices in high-availability environments becomes difficult because of those restraints. This paper introduces digital dice, a virtual representation of IoT devices and cyber-physical systems based on microservices that uses the standard established by the W3C, the Web of Things, as the underlying framework to declare its possible interactions. The article puts forward the different strategies that Digital Dice uses to mitigate the problems raised. Furthermore, we contrast the performance of Digital Dice with using the devices directly, demonstrating its advantages in a process that requires High Availability.},

Although being technically feasible for a wide range of driving scenarios, the restrictions are still in place due to the lack of a clear safety strategy. An essential step towards safety is the introduction of a self-monitoring component. In this study, a self-evaluation concept is presented which assesses a system based on a physics-defined minimum prediction horizon for state-of-the-art Deep Learning-based trajectory prediction models. Since User Experience is a key metric for car manufacturers, a further manoeuvre constraint is added to the model. We emphasize the generalizability of the presented assessment concept, however, in order to demonstrate feasibility in practical use, three specific scenarios are discussed. The results are gained with real data from publicly available driving campaigns as well as synthetically generated simulation data. Two exemplary models, a simple LSTM-based model and VectorNet, a prominent motion prediction model, are evaluated. A quantitative assessment shows a lack of training data in the public datasets for vehicle speeds > 25 m/s in order to offer safe driving above such vehicle speeds.},

  abstract     = {Effective resource utilization in healthcare related systems is the prime objective to ensure patient care. However, to effectively utilize the treatment time, for example such as transporting patients to diagnostics centres, and providing timely medication, requires efficient optimization of the resources. These resources are hospital staff such as caregivers, nurses, physicians, etc. and other diagnostic resources such as MRI machines, X-Ray machines and other general-purpose resources such as hospital beds, wheelchairs, etc. To model the behaviour of a system with time constraints, timed automata are useful and also helpful in representing system dynamic properties (i.e., requirements). However, the healthcare applications such as utilizing healthcare resources require formal verification to ensure the system’s correctness. The paper presents an approach to model the resource allocation process as Timed Automata and further verifies the system’s properties using a model checking tool, UPPAAL. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated using a hospital situation where the combination of patient and caregiver is used. A few example healthcare resource utilization scenarios are derived to use as a case study to validate the proposed approach. We show how an individual patient is efficiently assigned to the available caregiver in a clinical setup.},

Software performance antipatterns could be a key means to tackle this challenge since they recognize design problems that may lead to unacceptable system performance. This manuscript focuses on modeling and analyzing a variegate set of software performance antipatterns with the goal of quantifying their performance impact on CPS. Starting from the specification of eight software performance antipatterns, we build a baseline queuing network performance model that is properly extended to account for the corresponding bad practices. The approach is applied to a CPS consisting of a network of sensors and experimental results show that performance degradation can be traced back to software performance antipatterns. Sensitivity analysis investigates the peculiar characteristics of antipatterns, such as the frequency of checking the status of resources, that provides quantitative information to software designers to help them identify potential performance problems and their root causes. Quantifying the performance impact of antipatterns on CPS paves the way for future work enabling the automated refactoring of systems to remove these bad practices.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for remote sensing applications, offering rich spectral information across a broad electromagnetic spectrum. However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data poses significant challenges in analysis and interpretation. In this study, we propose a novel approach for hyperspectral image processing, focusing on dimensionality reduction, albedo recovery, and subsequent classification. Our method begins with a grouping strategy based on the electromagnetic spectrum that considers the images’ physical properties, facilitating the segmentation of hyperspectral data into meaningful spectral bands. This grouping reduces the dimensionality of the data and preserves crucial spectral information. Subsequently, we integrate autoencoders to incorporate non-linear transformations in the feature extraction phase, thereby improving the model’s capacity to learn intricate patterns within the data. A key goal of our methodology is to effectively embed spatial information into the representation. Albedo recovery is employed aimed at improving spatial resolution while retaining spectral fidelity. By leveraging the reduced-dimensional representation obtained through grouping and autoencoders, we reconstruct the hyperspectral image with enhanced spatial details, thereby facilitating more accurate interpretation and analysis. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we perform experiments using three standard hyperspectral datasets: Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas.},

  abstract     = {The convergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and autonomous systems presents numerous application areas and challenges. Many CPS use cases require autonomy, which necessitates robust monitoring, maintenance, and longevity of these systems. However, handling unmodeled data, environmental uncertainties, and emergent behaviour poses significant challenges. This paper proposes the use of a novel formalism, Extended Hidden Markov Models with 
$$\epsilon $$
 ϵ -emissions ( 
$$\epsilon $$
 ϵ -HMMT), to estimate the correctness of an autonomous system’s emergent behaviour in complex and changing environments. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different modeling approaches, emphasizing the need for a more adaptable and robust modeling technique.},

  abstract     = {Background Despite reporting the positive effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on endurance performance, very few studies have investigated its efficacy in anaerobic short all-out activities. Moreover, there is still no consensus on which brain areas could provide the most favorable effects on different performance modalities. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) targeting the primary motor cortex (M1) or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on physical performance, psychophysiological responses, and cognitive function in repeated all-out cycling. Methods In this randomized, crossover, and double-blind study, 15 healthy physically active men underwent a-tDCS targeting M1 or the left DLPFC or sham tDCS in separate days before performing three bouts of all-out 30s cycling anaerobic test. a-tDCS was applied using 2 mA for 20 min. Peak power, mean power, fatigue index, and EMG of the quadriceps muscles were measured during each bout. Heart rate, perceived exertion, affective valence, and arousal were recorded two minutes after each bout. Color-word Stroop test and choice reaction time were measured at baseline and after the whole anaerobic test. Results Neither tDCS montage significantly changed peak power, mean power, fatigue index, heart rate, affective valence, arousal, and choice reaction time (p> 0.05) . a-tDCS over DLPFC significantly lowered RPE of the first bout (compared to sham; p _ = 0.048, Δ _ = -12.5},

  abstract     = {IoT devices are more important than ever. In a connected world, IoT devices have many uses. They are no longer merely used at work; they are part of our everyday lives. Security concerns arise if the devices generate, collect, or process sensitive data. Physical layer security controls are the cornerstone once the risk for humans increases when physical security fails. To achieve security in IoT devices, preventing is better than detecting. Formal verification is an important and valuable tool for detecting possible vulnerabilities and ensuring data security. Thus, this paper proposes an Event-B proof-based formal model of IoT physical layer security and attacks from the requirements analysis level to the goal level. Our model is built incrementally using a refining method during design and verification. We present a three-level formal approach: first, the construction of the IoT physical layer; then, we check for IoT physical layer vulnerabilities by processing the lack of some characteristics that cause these vulnerabilities, such as speed, typical bandwidth, and power consumption; lastly, we detect physical layer attacks like jamming and MAC spoofing, which helps to build security proofs. Our approach uses an electrocardiogram (ECG) IoT system as a case study, and as an additional case study to back up the proposed method’s generalizability, we used a fire alarm system. Also, we use the proof obligations and the ProB animator in the Rodin model checking tool to check and validate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Physical adversarial attacks against vehicle detection are gaining attention. However, most prior works focus on improving attack ability by amplifying the intensity and scope of perturbations, which results in a visually suspicious appearance that exposes attackers’ behavior. Motivated by the shape preference characteristic exhibited in human cognitive processes, we propose a shape constraint physical camouflage attack (SC-PCA) to generate vehicle camouflage. To generate naturalistic perturbations, we use a contour image as the control condition and introduce a shape-aware loss in conditional generative adversarial network. Then, we map the perturbations onto the surface of the target vehicle to form the camouflage. By setting different transformation parameters, vehicle images of multiple perspectives and multiple scenes can be rendered. Experiments conducted in both digital and physical worlds demonstrate that our method has a good attack ability, can deceive the vehicle detector in the real world, and can adapt to various angle, distance, and background changes. Moreover, the outcome of the human perception survey indicates that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.},

However, the ultra-high data rate and ultra-low latency requirements for XR 360° video transmissions present new signal processing challenges for XR communication systems. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of promising physical layer signal processing technologies for XR communications and systems. These include multiple antenna technologies for XR, mmWave/terahertz waves for XR communication, machine-learning-based XR transmission, and resource allocations for XR communications. Additionally, we propose a novel signal processing and transmission framework that fully exploits the space-time-frequency dimensions of virtual reality communications. Finally, we summarize the current technical challenges in signal processing for XR communications and related systems and discuss future trends in XR communications.},

  abstract     = {This work suggests several methods of uncertainty treatment in multiscale modelling and describes their application to a system of coupled turbulent transport simulations of a tokamak plasma. We propose a method to quantify the usually aleatoric uncertainty of a system in a quasistationary state, estimating the mean values and their errors for quantities of interest, which is average heat fluxes in the case of turbulence simulations. The method defines the stationarity of the system and suggests a way to balance the computational cost of simulation and the accuracy of estimation. This allows, contrary to many approaches, to incorporate of aleatoric uncertainties in the analysis of the model and to have a quantifiable decision for simulation runtime. Furthermore, the paper describes methods for quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a model and the results of such a procedure for turbulence simulations, identifying the model’s sensitivity to particular input parameters and sensitivity to uncertainties in total. Finally, we introduce a surrogate model approach based on Gaussian Process Regression and present a preliminary result of training and analysing the performance of such a model based on turbulence simulation data. Such an approach shows a potential to significantly decrease the computational cost of the uncertainty propagation for the given model, making it feasible on current HPC systems.},

  abstract     = {Global sensitivity analysis is of great significance for risk assessment of structural systems. In order to efficiently perform sensitivity analysis for systems with multivariate output, this paper adopts Kriging-based analytical (KBA) technique to estimate multivariate sensitivity indices (MSI). Two MSI are studied in this paper, namely, MSI based on principal component analysis (MSI-PCA) and MSI based on covariance decomposition (MSI-CD). For MSI-PCA, Kriging models of inputs and each retained output principal component (PC) are firstly established, and then KBA technique is used to derive the sensitivities associated with each retained PC and the generalized MSI-PCA. For MSI-CD, Kriging model is constructed to map input variables and each time output variable, based on which subset variances and the corresponding MSI-CD are derived by KBA technique. In addition, to avoid constructing Kriging model at each time instant when calculating MSI-CD, a new double-loop Kriging (D-Kriging) method is developed to further improve the efficiency. The accuracy and efficiency of KBA and D-Kriging methods for MSI estimation are tested and discussed by four examples in Sect. 4.},

This study proposes a Fuzzy Logic-based Adaptive PID (APID) controller for simultaneous pressure and level control in the PZR system. In contrast to contemporary machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based control methods which often entail high computational cost, limited interpretability, and certification challenges the proposed APID controller emphasizes real-time feasibility, transparency, and regulatory compliance, which are essential in nuclear safety applications. The controller retains the intuitive structure of classical PID control while integrating rule-based fuzzy logic for online gain adaptation. This hybrid architecture facilitates explainable decision-making, enhances operator trust, and supports formal verification. The controller was deployed on a low-cost STM32F407 microcontroller, meeting strict memory and timing constraints, and was validated through extensive Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) testing. Utilizing a high-fidelity, nonlinear two-region thermodynamic model of the PZR, simulation results across diverse operating scenarios including load-following transients, coolant flow loss, and setpoint shifts demonstrate significant performance enhancements over conventional PID controllers. Key improvements include up to 90},

  abstract     = {For amplitude-modulated sound, the envelope interaural time difference (ITD_ENV) is a potential cue for sound-source location. ITD_ENV is encoded in the lateral superior olive (LSO) of the auditory brainstem, by excitatory-inhibitory (EI) neurons receiving ipsilateral excitation and contralateral inhibition. Between human listeners, sensitivity to ITD_ENV varies considerably, but ultimately decreases with increasing stimulus carrier frequency, and decreases more strongly with increasing modulation rate. Mechanisms underlying the variation in behavioral sensitivity remain unclear. Here, with increasing carrier frequency (4–10 kHz), as we phenomenologically model the associated decrease in ITD_ENV sensitivity using arbitrarily fewer neurons consistent across populations, we computationally model the variable sensitivity across human listeners and modulation rates (32–800 Hz) as the decreasing range of membrane frequency responses in LSO neurons. Transposed tones stimulate a bilateral auditory-periphery model, driving model EI neurons where electrical membrane impedance filters the frequency content of inputs driven by amplitude-modulated sound, evoking modulation filtering. Calculated from Fisher information in spike-rate functions of ITD_ENV, for model EI neuronal populations distinctly reflecting the LSO range in membrane frequency responses, just-noticeable differences in ITD_ENV collectively reproduce the largest variation in ITD_ENV sensitivity across human listeners. These slow to fast model populations each generally match the best human ITD_ENV sensitivity at a progressively higher modulation rate, by membrane-filtering and spike-generation properties producing realistically less than Poisson variance. Non-resonant model EI neurons are also sensitive to interaural intensity differences. With peripheral filters centered between carrier frequency and modulation sideband, fast resonant model EI neurons extend ITD_ENV sensitivity above 500-Hz modulation.},

Firstly, new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the exponential stability of the nominal considered system are proposed and proved, by constructing an augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, by using the discrete Wirtinger-based inequality combined with an improved form of Reciprocally Convex Lemma (RCL) and by considering the two types of switching signal mentioned above. Then, and based on the obtained results, new criteria are established to ensure the robust exponential stability for uncertain discrete-time switched systems with interval time-varying delay. The established conditions are dependent on the lower and the upper delay bounds and are expressed in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, some slack variables are introduced by using the Finsler lemma in order to give more relaxation for the studied system. Consequently, the proposed approach is proved to have some less conservative results over than some recent works of the literature. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the merit and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Clinical curative effect is the core value and fundamental pursuit of medicine. The data-driven clinical quantitative evaluation model is an important research issue in clinical efficacy evaluation. The existing clinical efficacy evaluation methods have made a lot of contributions to the structured information of static attributes, but less attention is paid to the heterogeneous information with dynamic and random characteristics. This paper discusses a class of clinical efficacy evaluation decision-making problems that contain both time-series and dynamic characteristics and uses the three-way decision principle to describe these characteristics. The group decision-making theory is introduced to aggregate the evaluation information of time series dynamic features generated in the decision-making process. A time series dynamic three-way group decision model for clinical efficacy evaluation is constructed, the optimal decision rules with minimum expected loss objective are calculated and proofed in the proposed model, and then the optimal treatment alternative is obtained. Finally, taking the decision-making problem of clinical efficacy evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment of atopic dermatitis as the research object, based on the actual clinical data of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of TCM, the decision-making process and steps of the theoretical model constructed in this paper are verified and applied. The data-driven quantitative clinical evaluation model has achieved better application effects than the actual clinical scenarios. The research results in this paper provide new ideas and theoretical methods for real-world clinical efficacy evaluation research.},

  abstract     = {Technological advances in embedded systems and the advent of fog computing led to improved quality of service of applications of cyber-physical systems. In fact, the deployment of such applications on powerful and heterogeneous embedded systems, such as multiprocessors system-on-chips (MPSoCs), allows them to meet latency requirements and real-time operation. Highly relevant to the industry and our reference case-study, the challenging field of nuclear fusion deploys the aforementioned applications, involving high-frequency control with hard real-time and safety constraints. The use of fog computing and MPSoCs is promising to achieve safety, low latency, and timeliness of such control. Indeed, on one hand, applications designed according to fog computing distribute computation across hierarchically organized and geographically distributed edge devices, enabling timely anomaly detection during high-frequency sampling of time series, and, on the other hand, MPSoCs allow leveraging fog computing and integrating monitoring by deploying tasks on a flexible platform suited for mixed-criticality software, leading to so-called mixed criticality systems (MCSs). However, the integration of such software on the same MPSoC opens challenges related to predictability and reliability guarantees, as tasks interfering with each other when accessing the same shared MPSoC resources may introduce non-deterministic latency, possibly leading to failures on account of deadline overruns. Addressing the design, deployment, and evaluation of MCSs on MPSoCs, we propose a model-based system development process that facilitates the integration of real-time and monitoring software on the same platform by means of a formal notation for modeling the design and deployment of MPSoCs. The proposed notation allows developers to leverage embedded hypervisors for monitoring real-time applications and guaranteeing predictability by isolation of hardware resources. Providing evidence of the feasibility of our system development process and evaluating the industry-relevant class of nuclear fusion applications, we experiment with a safety-critical case-study in the context of the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. Our experimentation involves the design and evaluation of several prototypes deployed as MCSs on a virtualized MPSoC, showing that deployment choices linked to the monitor placement and virtualization configurations (e.g., resource allocation, partitioning, and scheduling policies) can significantly impact the predictability of MCSs in terms of Worst-Case Execution Times and other related metrics.},

In this study, we developed an integrated runtime verification for the safety and security of an industrial robot inspection system. Runtime verification is a lightweight technique that involves evaluating the behaviour of a system at runtime. The developed runtime verification system is named MARVer. In the experiments, firstly, the runtime verification is independently for safety and security using MARVer-R. Then, integrated runtime verification is realized to monitor the effects of security attacks on safety. The experiments are evaluated in a TRL5 laboratory environment designed for quality inspection of automotive-body-in-white. Our study highlights the importance of verifying safety and security at runtime.},

  abstract     = {To explain specific phenomena, scientists perform a sequence of tasks, e.g., to gather, analyze and interpret data, forming a scientific workflow. Depending on the complexity of the workflow, scientists require access to various kinds of tools, applications and infrastructures for individual tasks. Current approaches are often limited to managing these resources at design time, requiring the scientist to preemptively set up applications essential for their workflow. Therefore, a dynamic provisioning and configuration of computing resources are required that fulfills these needs at runtime. In this paper, we present a dynamic runtime model that couples workflow tasks with their individual applications and infrastructure requirements. This runtime model is used as a knowledge base by a model-driven workflow execution engine orchestrating the sequence of tasks and their infrastructure. We exhibit that the simplicity of the runtime model supports the creation of highly tailored infrastructures, the integration of self-developed applications, as well as a human-in-the-loop allowing scientists to monitor and interact with the workflow at runtime. To tackle the heterogeneity of cloud provider interfaces, we implement the workflow runtime model by extending the Open Cloud Computing Interface cloud standard, which provides an extensible data model as well as a uniform interface to manage cloud resources. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using three case studies and discuss the benefits of the runtime model from a user and system perspective.},

An integral sliding mode surface is designed based on the estimations of the mismatched disturbances, which enables the control scheme to reject the mismatched disturbances. A continuous terminal sliding mode control law is then proposed, which guarantees that the convergence time is finite and independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, the rigorous analysis for the fixed-time stability is presented with the bi-limit homogeneous property and Lyapunov theory. Finally, both the numerical simulations and the experimental tests are given to verify the superiority of the proposed fixed-time control scheme. The core of the proposed control scheme, which is developed with the nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) technique and fixed-time disturbance observer, ensures the fixed-time convergence and strong robustness to mismatched disturbances. The practical significance of the proposed control design is demonstrated by a real application to a crane system.},

  abstract     = {We develop a stochastic volatility framework for modeling multiple currencies based on CBI-time-changed Lévy processes. The proposed framework captures the typical risk characteristics of FX markets and is coherent with the symmetries of FX rates. Moreover, due to the self-exciting behavior of CBI processes, the volatilities of FX rates exhibit self-exciting dynamics. By relying on the theory of affine processes, we show that our approach is analytically tractable and that the model structure is invariant under a suitable class of risk-neutral measures. A semi-closed pricing formula for currency options is obtained by Fourier methods. We propose two calibration methods, also by relying on deep-learning techniques, and show that a simple specification of the model can achieve a good fit to market data on a currency triangle.},

Hereby, distribution results in communication delays among agents that have to be adequately taken into account by software models to avoid race conditions.

In this paper, we employ Timed Graph Transformation Systems (TGTSs) to model DCPSs and distinguish between local immediate and remote

 δ -delay robust TGTS model, and (c) analyze the restrictiveness of the widening and the resulting TGTS model for new unsafe behavior. As a running example, we consider a DCPS in which multiple distributed autonomous shuttles locally coordinate their movement on a track topology to avoid collisions.},

  abstract     = {We present in this paper the tool HStriver, an extensible stream runtime verification tool for monitoring real-time event streams. Real-time event streams are formed by events that contain rich data and can occur at arbitrary times. The rich expressivity of HStriver allows the specifications of quantitative semantics of logics like signal temporal logic (STL), including different notions of robustness. Stream runtime verification is a specification family of languages based on the clean separation between temporal dependencies and data computations. To encode the data values contained in the events (both read as inputs and produced as the result of computation) HStriver borrows a large subset of data-types from Haskell. These types are transparently lifted into the HStriver specification language and incorporated in the temporal engine, so they can be used as the types of the input (observations), output (verdicts), and intermediate streams. The temporal evaluation engine is agnostic of the types used in the specification. The resulting extensible language is then embedded into Haskell as an embedded Domain Specific Langauge. The availability of functional features in the specification language enables the direct implementation of desirable features in HStriver like parametrization (using functions that return stream definitions), etc. The resulting tool, HStriver, is a flexible and extensible stream runtime verification engine for real-time streams. We illustrate the use of HStriver on many sophisticated real-time specifications, including realistic STL properties of existing designs.},

Yet, a growing body of evidence suggests that channel-based programming abstractions also have their issues. The Discourje project aims to help programmers cope with channels and concurrency bugs in Clojure programs, based on dynamic analysis. The idea is that programmers write not only implementations of communication protocols in their Clojure programs, but also specifications. Discourje then offers a run-time verification library to ensure that channel actions in implementations are safe relative to specifications. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of Discourje, including case studies, theoretical foundations, and practical aspects.},

  abstract     = {Despite the ubiquitous nature of evidence accumulation models in cognitive and experimental psychology, there has been a comparatively limited uptake of such techniques in the applied literature. While quantifying latent cognitive processing properties has significant potential for applied domains such as adaptive work systems, accumulator models often fall short in practical applications. Two primary reasons for these shortcomings are the complexities and time needed for the application of cognitive models, and the failure of current models to capture systematic trial-to-trial variability in parameters. In this manuscript, we develop a novel, trial-varying extension of the shifted Wald model to address these concerns. By leveraging conjugate properties of the Wald distribution, we derive computationally efficient solutions for threshold and drift parameters which can be updated instantaneously with new data. The resulting model allows the quantification of systematic variation in latent cognitive parameters across trials and we demonstrate the utility of such analyses through simulations and an exemplar application to an existing data set. The analytic nature of our solutions opens the door for real-world applications, significantly extending the reach of computational models of behavioral responses.},

  abstract     = {Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) anomalies, such as hijacking, is currently growing in trend due to limited detection capabilities. BGP hijacking maliciously reroutes Internet traffic, causing Denial of Service (DoS) to major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or redirection attacks to Internet users. While it has been shown that BGP anomalies can be detected using machine learning (ML) methods, the features used to train these ML models are not comprehensive. This is because node level features, such as the number of BGP announcements, average Autonomous System (AS) path length and average edit distance do not consider the structure or relationships present in the network graph. In this paper, an approach to extract information from BGP updates to build a network graph is proposed. Then, centrality information is used as features to model the graphical structure of the network to build an early detection tool for BGP anomalies using ML. The proposed method has been validated on real world data from the CenturyLink outage and shows promising results for anomaly detection (as early as one hour before the event was reported) in both individual and a defined group of networks. Furthermore, the anomaly source can be determined using the proposed method.},

The task parallel execution model is promising to efficiently utilize such a large-scale system by minimizing synchronizations in comparison with traditional models. In this paper, we propose a task-parallel runtime system that individually considers the processors for task management and task execution; those two roles could be assigned to different processors. This paper focuses on NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA as an example of heterogeneous multi-node systems, which are equipped with two kinds of general-purpose processors, to exploit the system heterogeneity for efficient task-parallel execution. Specifically, the proposed runtime system is used to select an appropriate processor for task management, depending on several execution conditions. The performance of the proposed runtime is discussed by running a Cholesky factorization implementation.

Whereas, sarcasm detection is employed to identify and determine whether a statement or piece of text is intended to convey a meaning conflicting to its literal interpretation, often with a mocking or ironic tone. In this study, two methods are proposed for sentiment analysis and one for Sarcasm Detection. One dataset i.e. Amazon Food Reviews is used for analyzing the sentiment and another dataset i.e. Sarcastic News Headlines is used for analyzing sarcasm. To overcome the shortcomings of some previously implemented methods, RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) are proposed. In the study, RoBERTa performed better than VADER. RoBERTa has proven better due to its Transfer Learning approach, deep contextual understanding, domain adaptation, and extensive pretraining. Naive Bayes is proposed as it is sometimes considered better than other methods for sarcasm detection due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in capturing certain linguistic patterns associated with sarcasm. Sentiments analysis model based on RoBERTa attained an accuracy of 88.95},

  abstract     = {Background For the design and analysis of clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes, the Cox proportional hazards model and the logrank test have been the cornerstone methods for many decades. Increasingly, the key assumption of proportionality—or time-fixed effects—that underpins these methods has been called into question. The availability of novel therapies with new mechanisms of action and clinical trials of longer duration mean that non-proportional hazards are now more frequently encountered. Methods We compared several regression-based methods to model time-dependent treatment effects. For illustration purposes, we used selected endpoints from a large, community-based clinical trial of low dose daily aspirin in older persons. Relative and absolute estimands were defined, and analyses were conducted in all participants. Additional exploratory analyses were undertaken by selected subgroups of interest using interaction terms in the regression models. Discussion In the trial with median 4.7 years follow-up, we found evidence for non-proportionality and a time-dependent treatment effect of aspirin on cancer mortality not previously reported in trial findings. We also found some evidence of time-dependence to an aspirin by age interaction for major adverse cardiovascular events. For other endpoints, time-fixed treatment effect estimates were confirmed as appropriate. Conclusions The consideration of treatment effects using both absolute and relative estimands enhanced clinical insights into potential dynamic treatment effects. We recommend these analytical approaches as an adjunct to primary analyses to fully explore findings from clinical trials.},

  abstract     = {Climate change and global warming are among the most severe threats to the global ecosystem, caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, all industries that cause environmental emissions should collaborate in the struggle against climate change. In this context, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) approved the initial greenhouse gas strategy at the MEPC 72 session in April 2018 to achieve targets for 2050. With this strategy, the IMO aims to create and improve new regulations that can enhance energy efficiency to achieve their short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. In this study, one of the novel terms, energy efficiency existing ship index (EEXI) values, has been calculated for the Turkish fleet to guide the maritime sector. The Turkish fleet in the study refers to the Turkish-owned vessels both sailing with a national or international flag. In accordance with this regulation, the number of Turkish fleets that were identified as either above or below the IMO reference lines has been determined. Additionally, EEXI values have been recalculated using the engine power limitation (EPL) method for ships that exceed the required limits, and the success rate of this method has been estimated. As a result, the application of EPL increased the number of ships below the Phase 2 reference line from 15.6},

Accurately predicting commodity markets requires an understanding of fundamental market dynamics such as the interplay between supply and demand, which are not considered in standard affective models. This paper introduces two domain-specific affective models, CrudeBERT and CrudeBERT+, that adapt sentiment analysis to the crude oil market by incorporating economic theory with common knowledge of the mentioned entities and social knowledge extracted from Google Trends. To evaluate the predictive capabilities of these models, comprehensive experiments were conducted using dynamic time warping to identify the model that best approximates WTI crude oil futures price movements. The evaluation included news headlines and crude oil prices between January 2012 and April 2021. The results show that CrudeBERT+ outperformed RavenPack, BERT, FinBERT, and early CrudeBERT models during the 9-year evaluation period and within most of the individual years that were analyzed. The success of the introduced domain-specific affective models demonstrates the potential of integrating economic theory with sentiment analysis and external knowledge sources to improve the predictive power of financial sentiment analysis models. The experiments also confirm that CrudeBERT+ has the potential to provide valuable insights for decision-making in the crude oil market.},

RoBERTa consistently outperformed DistilBERT and XLM-RoBERTa, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-scores. However, extended training epochs in RoBERTa_5 indicated signs of overfitting, making the model fine-tuned for 3 epochs (RoBERTa_3) a suitable model for classifying sentiments on unseen data. These findings provide practical guidance for selecting optimal transformer models for sentiment analysis in specialised financial domains like CBDCs, emphasising the importance of balancing training duration with generalisation capabilities.},

We consider two Lévy models driven by the derived Brownian motion and the spectrally negative Lévy process. These two Lévy models keep the form of the Lévy process unchanged under the measure transform. We use single and double Laplace transforms combined with numerical Fourier inversion to find closed-form expressions for the price of CoCo bonds. The results show that the model driven by the spectrally negative Lévy process would provide a more accurate CoCo bond price when considering the phenomenon of jumps in the financial market. Indeed, negative jumps play a critical role in the pricing of CoCo bonds. This paper underlines the importance of the CoCo bonds valuation using the Lévy process.},

  abstract     = {The surgical field is always evolving, as new techniques and tools are developed. Robotic technology has been playing an important role in surgical procedures, especially in complex surgeries. Robotic surgery is intricately connected with minimally invasive procedures, where surgeries are performed through small incisions. It may also find occasional use in different categories of open surgeries. There are many benefits to robotic surgery, including that it is minimally invasive and can be done without incision. The downside to robotic surgery is that it can be expensive, and the quality of the results may not be good. Advancements in robotics are introducing fresh benefits to the operating room. Nevertheless, there are concerns voiced by individuals about the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery. In order to gain a better understanding of these issues, an exploration was carried out involving sentiment analysis of online discussions concerning robotic surgery. This analysis focused on tweets shared on X (formerly Twitter). Furthermore, this research paper utilizes “RoboSens” algorithm which is a domain-specific customization based on the VADER sentiment analysis model, specifically tailored to analyze public opinion on robotic surgery using X data.

Experiment 1 focused on the color emotional characteristics of multimedia webpage color combinations and identified the most popular dual-tone color designs for multimedia webpages. Experiment 2 involved an examination of the optimal visual effect design for multimedia webpage composition. Ten types of geometric shapes were selected and combined with dynamic pictures, and the combined products were then used to conduct a multimedia dynamic pictorial webpage experiment; the purpose of the experiment was to test the effects of geometrical dynamic shapes on webpage psychology and determine the most popular multimedia dynamic picture visual design style. The researchers used semantic differential and Likert scales to conduct psychological tests aimed at measuring psychological reactions to various webpage colors and visual designs. The results indicated that the most popular color combinations for multimedia webpages are cyan and gray, cyan and black, and blue violet and gray. The most suitable graphic shape for multimedia visual designs is the oval and square dynamic picture composition. The results of the multimedia webpage color and visual effect design experiments can serve as a reference for webpage design-related research and to webpage designers.},

  abstract     = {Verifying safety requirements by model checking becomes increasingly important for safety-critical applications. For the validity of such proof in practice, the model needs to capture the actual behavior of the real system, which could be tested by containment checks of real observation traces. Basic equivalence checks, however, are not applicable if the system is only partially or imprecisely observable, if the model abstracts from explicit states with symbolic semantics, or if the checks are not expressible in the logics supported by a model checker. In this article, we solve the problem of observation containment checking in timed automata via reachability checking on tester systems. We introduce the logic SRL (sequence reachability logic) to express observations as sequences of delayed reachability properties. Through SBLL (introduced by Aceto et al.) as intermediate logic, we synthesize a set of matcher model templates for partial and imprecise observations and further extend these templates for the case of limited state accessibility in a model. For the obtained matching traces, we define the back-transformation into the original model domain and formally prove the correctness of the transformation. We implemented the observation matching approach, and apply it to a set of 7 demo and 3 case study models with different levels of observability. The results show that all positive and negative observations are correctly classified, and that the most advanced matcher model instance still offers average run times between 0.1 and 1 s in all but 3 scenarios.},

We analyzed the dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change protests in 2019. We found bots to impact human behavior more than the other way around during active discussions. To assess the causal impact of bot encounters, we compared communication histories of those who interacted with bots with matched users who did not. There is a consistent negative impact of bot encounters on subsequent sentiment. The impact on sentiment is conditional on the user’s original support level, with a more negative impact on those with a favourable or neutral stance towards climate activism. Political ’astroturfing’ bots induce an increase in human communications, while encounters with other bots result in a decrease. Bot encounters do not change activists’ engagement levels in climate activism. Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring the influence of social bots, as with new technological advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes ever more challenging.},

This method is more widely used than the existed method combining importance sampling (IS) with time-dependent adaptive Kriging surrogate (AK) model, which is not only suitable for time-dependent reliability problems with single design point, but also for multiple design points, high nonlinearity, and multiple failure modes, especially for small failure probability problems. This method combines ARBIS with time-dependent AK model. First, at each sample point, the AK model of the performance function with regard to time t is established in the inner layer, and its minimum value is calculated as the performance function value of the outer layer to established time-independent AK model. Then, the optimal radius of the β -sphere is obtained with an efficient adaptive scheme. Excluding a β -sphere from the sample pool, there is no need to calculate the performance function value of the samples inside the β -sphere, which greatly improves the estimation efficiency of structural reliability analysis. Finally, three numerical examples are given to show the estimation efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of this method.},

  abstract     = {Growth mixture modeling (GMM) is an analytical tool for identifying multiple unobserved sub-populations in longitudinal processes. In particular, it describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and investigates between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group. A key research interest in using GMMs is examining how covariates influence the heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu     Perera (2022b) extended mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which primarily focus on time-invariant covariates, to allow covariates to account for both within-group and between-group differences and investigate the heterogeneity in nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu     Perera, 2022b by examining the effects of time-varying covariates (TVCs) on trajectory heterogeneity. Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into an initial trait (the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of temporal states (interval-specific slopes or changes of the TVC). The initial trait is allowed to account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e., baseline effect), while the temporal states are allowed to impact observed values of a longitudinal process (i.e., temporal effects). We evaluate the proposed models using a simulation study and real-world data analysis. The simulation study demonstrates that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories into several clusters and generally producing unbiased and accurate estimates with target coverage probabilities. The proposed models reveal the heterogeneity in initial trait and temporal states of reading ability across latent classes of students’ mathematics performance. Additionally, the baseline and temporal effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous across the clusters of students.},

And then, by considering the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with exponential term and taking the appropriate positive parameter, the state feedback controller is achieved to ensure the exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the proposed design scheme is utilized to the control design of resonant circuit system.},

  abstract     = {Attack trees (ATs) are an important tool in security analysis, and an important part of AT analysis is computing metrics. However, metric computation is NP-complete in general. In this paper, we showcase the use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) as a tool for quantitative analysis. Specifically, we use MILP to solve the open problem of calculating the min time metric of dynamic ATs, i.e., the minimal time to attack a system. We also present two other tools to further improve our MILP method: First, we show how the computation can be sped up by identifying the modules of an AT, i.e. subtrees connected to the rest of the AT via only one node. Second, we define a general semantics for dynamic ATs that significantly relaxes the restrictions on attack trees compared to earlier work, allowing us to apply our methods to a wide variety of ATs. Experiments on a synthetic testing set of large ATs verify that both the integer linear programming approach and modular analysis considerably decrease the computation time of attack time analysis.},

Our semantics also extends to truth values that are partially ordered and allows the modeling of uncertainty in satisfaction. We propose a compositional approach for the construction of online monitors that transform exact representations of piecewise constant (dense-time and continuous-time) signals. These monitors are based on a class of infinite-state deterministic signal transducers that (1) are allowed to produce the output signal with some bounded delay relative to the input signal, and (2) do not introduce unbounded variability in the output signal. A key ingredient of our monitoring framework is an efficient algorithm for sliding-window aggregation over dense-time signals. We have implemented and experimentally evaluated our monitoring framework by comparing it to the recently proposed online monitoring tools Reelay and RTAMT.},

  abstract     = {Models of possible attacks and defenses can help assess and improve an organization’s cybersecurity posture. However, existing models for analyzing cybersecurity fail to adequately model the temporal aspects of attacks and defenses. For example, game-theoretic models typically assume that the players (here, the attacker and the defender) take turns, and the effect of an action realizes immediately. In reality, attacker and defender actions may start asynchronously at any time and may have very different duration. This has important consequences. For example, whether the defender can successfully thwart an attack may depend on whether the defender can finish implementing a mitigation action before the attack would reach its goal. This paper proposes a new, formal model of cybersecurity attacks and defense, with a special focus on the time dimension. The model allows reasoning about temporal aspects, such as how the duration of defensive actions impacts their ability to prevent attacks. Based on the proposed formal model, we develop a simulator that supports easy experimentation and what-if analysis with different attack and defense strategies.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale cyber-physical systems, such as those for subway transportation or air traffic control, are becoming increasingly complex and often need to operate without human intervention. At the same time, these systems are subject to high requirements on the timing behavior and fault-tolerance. Consequently, the detection and mitigation of both hard and soft errors is of high importance in the already complex systems design process. The main challenges towards fault-aware real-time systems is the overall system design, in which the sheer size of the state-space and the system’s complexity exceeds the capacity of today’s development tools. In this paper, we present a new holistic methodology called FAA+RTS, for designing fault-aware adaptive real-time systems. We cover the entire path from system specification using a coordination language, via design-space exploration and task scheduling to the adaptive fault-aware runtime environment. Mitigating both hard and soft errors addresses competing requirements. Improving soft error tolerance (through redundant execution) may accelerate the aging process of silicon, thus expediting hard error failures. FAA+RTS is a novel solution as it integrates previously-isolated methods for dealing with multiple constraints into a single framework, presenting a single overview of all possible trade-offs to the application designer. This integration ensures that all aspects of system design, from specification to execution, are cohesively addressed, resulting in a robust and reliable system. We exemplify FAA+RTS using industrial-sized autonomous subway transportation system as a use-case.},

Software-based fault-tolerance can help offer protection against SEUs on Commercial off The Shelf (COTS) hardware. However, such fault tolerance relies on replication, for which there may be insufficient resources in resource-constrained environments. Systems in the weakly-hard real-time domain can tolerate some faults as a product of their domain. Combining both the need for fault-tolerance and the intrinsic ability to tolerate faults, we propose a new approach for applying fault-tolerance named strategy switching . Strategy switching minimizes the effective unmitigated fault-rate by switching which tasks are to be run under a fault-tolerance scheme at runtime. Our method does not require bounding the number of faults for a given number of consecutive iterations. We show how our method improves the steady-state fault rate by analytically computing the rate for our test set of generated DAGs and comparing this against a static application of fault-tolerance. Finally, we validate our method using UPPAAL.},

The aim of the paper is to develop and analyze a spectrally accurate pseudospectral method in time and space to find the approximate solution to the reaction–diffusion model. The approximate solution is represented in terms of basis functions. The spectral coefficients are found in such a way that the residual becomes minimum. Error estimates for interpolating polynomials are derived. The computational experiments are carried out to corroborate the theoretical results and to compare the present method with existing methods in the literature.

  abstract     = {Purpose Surgical simulation is expected to be an effective way for physicians and medical students to learn surgical skills. To achieve real-time deformation of soft tissues with high visual quality, multiple resolution and adaptive mesh refinement models have been introduced. However, those models require additional processing time to map the deformation results of the deformed lattice to a polygon model. In this study, we propose a method to accelerate this process using vertex shaders on GPU and investigate its performance. Methods A hierarchical octree cube structure is generated from a high-resolution organ polygon model. The entire organ model is divided into pieces according to the cube structure. In a simulation, vertex coordinates of the organ model pieces are obtained by trilinear interpolation of the cube’s 8 vertex coordinates. This process is described in a shader program, and organ model vertices are processed in the rendering pipeline for acceleration. Results For a constant number of processing cubes, the CPU-based processing time increased linearly with the total number of organ model vertices, and the GPU-based time was nearly constant. On the other hand, for a constant number of model vertices, the GPU-based time increased linearly with the number of surface cubes. These linearities determine a condition that the GPU-based implementation is faster in the same frame time. Conclusion We implemented octree cube deformation mapping using vertex shaders and confirmed its performance. The experimental results showed that the GPU can accelerate the mapping process in high-resolution organ models with a large number of vertices.},

Previous studies conducted at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) revealed that patients typically waited an average of six hours before receiving the services at the OPD making KCMC have the longest waiting time of all the Zonal and National Referral Hospitals. KCMC implemented various interventions from 2016 to 2021 to reduce the waiting time. This study evaluates the outcome of the interventions on waiting time at the OPD. Methods This is an analytical cross-sectional mixed method using an explanatory sequential design. The study enrolled 412 patients who completed a structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted among 24 participants (i.e., 12 healthcare providers and 12 patients) from 3rd to 14th July, 2023. Also, a documentary review was conducted to review benchmarks with regards to waiting time. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable. All statistical tests were conducted at 5},

  abstract     = {Pregnancy is a time of profound upheaval of the self, when in addition to undergoing dramatic physical changes to accommodate a developing foetus, significant cognitive and social transformations occur in preparation for birth and parenthood. So far, research into cognitive constructions of the self has been either infant-centric or psychopathology-focused, so our understanding of the healthy, changing self in pregnancy remains relatively poor. This online experiment uses online questionnaires and two cognitive tasks to investigate how constructs relating to the mental self-model, including body representation, self-concept clarity, sense of agency , general self-efficacy and self-attribute learning, differ between first-time pregnant ( n  = 100) and never-been pregnant ( n  = 102) women. Results indicate that first-time pregnancy is associated with a significantly higher sense of body agency, body visibility, and body estrangement. Poorer accuracy for newly learned associations was also observed in the pregnant group. Whilst a typical self-processing bias was observed in both groups as expected, an intentional binding effect was absent. Notably, post-hoc exploratory analyses provide initial evidence for trimester effects, with a decisively higher self-reported sense of negative agency in the first trimester compared to the never-pregnant group and other trimesters. Further, body agency and self-efficacy were higher in the second-trimester group compared to the never-pregnant group, suggesting a period of relative recovery and consolidation of the new self. Taken together, our results suggest that aspects of self-representation and agency undergo significant shifts over the course of pregnancy and provide multiple exciting avenues for future research.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a model-free finite-time control method based on the prescribed performance control theory to solve the position and attitude coupled control problem of using small satellite to approach large non-cooperative target’s feature surface is proposed. Firstly, an accurate dynamics model is established to analyze the strong uncertainty of this nonlinear system. Then, relying on using an improved extended state observer to identify complex controlled system, the proposed method utilizes a finite-time performance function to perform homeomorphic mapping of position and attitude tracking errors and designs a feedback linearization control law to reconstruct the system into a decoupled multidimensional second-order linear system. While proving the finite-time stability of the designed performance function, parameter rules considering the discrete output of the actuator are also provided. Compared to others, the algorithm in this study is simpler and more scalable. Finally, the numerical simulation results show that the designed control algorithm meets the position and attitude accuracy requirements of in-orbit service and can achieve high-quality finite-time control without relying on precise prior models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown rapidly, as has the number of attacks against it. Certain limitations of the paradigm, such as reduced processing capacity and limited main and secondary memory, make it necessary to develop new methods for detecting attacks in real time as it is difficulty to adapt as has the techniques used in other paradigms. In this paper, we propose an architecture capable of generating complex event processing (CEP) rules for real-time attack detection in an automatic and completely unsupervised manner. To this end, CEP technology, which makes it possible to analyze and correlate a large amount of data in real time and can be deployed in IoT environments, is integrated with principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and the Mahalanobis distance. This architecture has been tested in two different experiments that simulate real attack scenarios in an IoT network. The results show that the rules generated achieved an F1 score of .9890 in detecting six different IoT attacks in real time.},

The application to be analysed is instrumented with DiSL to extract its execution trace. The extracted trace is then fed into the JIVE system to extract its state model based on the key attributes of the execution trace. JIVE framework provides options to generate the sequence, object and state model of the application from its execution trace. The extracted model from the execution trace based on the method calls in the application represents the run-time control flow model. The system was tested with three case studies (two small and one large application). The run-time execution trace and the model were successfully extracted in all the cases with very minimal overhead. The extracted run-time model aids in the comprehension of the run-time behaviour of complex applications and also for verification of properties of interest-based on the execution flow of the application.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between adult fish populations (the "stock") and the number of new fish entering the population (the "recruits") is essential for effective fisheries management. Traditionally, this relationship is represented by a stock-recruitment (SR) function, which is a simplified mathematical model that directly links stock size to recruitment. However, fish populations pass through several life stages, each stage influenced by unique population dynamic factors. Current SR functions often overlook these complexities, assuming that recruitment depends solely on the adult population size. In this study, we use a multi-stage, age-structured discrete-time population dynamic model that accounts for all life stages and the transitions between them. We demonstrate that, in general, a closed-form, univariate SR function may not accurately represent the recruitment process when these life stages are considered. Instead, we identify specific mathematical conditions under which a SR function is equivalent to our multi-stage model. Our findings suggest a re-evaluation of conventional SR models, advocating for multi-stage approaches to support fisheries management decisions.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring of a well and the surrounding reservoir performances is a crucial component in evaluating on-going and planning future well and field operations. This is carried out at all stages of a well life-span: from exploration to production and, sometimes, after abandonment. Despite tremendous progress in reservoir simulations, simple and fast techniques for well-reservoir performance evaluation are still demanded in the industry, especially in the context of the vast amount of permanent well monitoring data continuously accumulated. Such techniques are of special interest for on-the-fly well monitoring to detect and alarm about deteriorating performance issues. Installation of permanent pressure gauges in many wells motivated development of time-lapse Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA), capable of revealing and monitoring of different factors governing well performance and reservoir production. The paper describes PTA-based metrics introduced in the context of automated interpretation of time-lapse pressure responses and their derivatives. The paper begins with a review of time-lapse PTA applications in the oil and gas industry and examples of patterns formed by the time-lapse pressure transients and their derivatives in the log–log scale. Then, integral-based PTA-metrics for well-reservoir performance analysis are introduced. The metrics enable to distinguish between reservoir and well-reservoir connection contributions to a well’s performance using the Bourdet derivative, while avoiding the need for selecting and matching of a well-reservoir model. The metrics were further tested with synthetic well models and field cases. The testing demonstrated high accuracy of the metrics for the cases of vertical wells with stable transient patterns. Testing for the horizontal well cases has confirmed reliability of the metrics for the stable patterns, while change of the patterns may reduce the metrics reliability. Model independence and using only pressure and rate measurements as input data are the main advantages of the metrics for integration into automated interpretation workflows and on-the-fly analysis intensively developed in the industry.},

  abstract     = {The learning capacity of students is significantly influenced by the quality of instruction they receive in the classroom. With the rapid advancement of behavior detection technology, identifying classroom behaviors of students is becoming increasingly common in educational settings. However, the field still faces specific challenges, primarily concerning the accuracy of identifying student behaviors within complex and variable classroom environments, as well as the real-time capabilities of detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and straightforward algorithm based on the YOLO architecture. A Multi-scale Large Kernel Convolution Module (MLKCM) has been designed to capture feature information across various dimensions through multi-axis pooling, achieving adaptive receptive fields and effectively capturing multi-scale features. This design enhances the network’s sensitivity to feature information by incorporating convolution kernels of varying sizes. Subsequently, we introduce a Progressive Feature Optimization Module (PFOM) to segment the channel dimension of the input feature map. This module integrates feature refinement blocks progressively, which not only preserve the refined features but also efficiently aggregate both local and global information. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments using the SCB-Dataset3-S and SCB-Dataset3-U datasets. The results demonstrated mean Average Precision (mAP) values of 76.5},

The simulated evacuees are provided with the ability to estimate the risk of alternative routes by providing a risk factor model. In addition, protection of agent from direct exposure to the threat is presented through modeling the precautionary time factor, based on maintaining a dynamically varying minimum distance with respect to agent safety. Simulations are performed to calibrate the parameters in the risk and precautionary time models. The effect of contribution on the evacuation process is investigated. Using the proposed model in order to test different configurations can enable researchers in the field of fire safety to provide an optimal building profile and to develop better guidance systems.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel model selection approach to time series forecasting. For linear stationary processes, such as AR processes, the direction of time is independent of the model parameters. By combining theoretical principles of time-reversibility in time series with conventional modeling approaches such as information criteria, we construct a criterion that employs the backwards prediction (backcast) as a proxy for the forecast. Hereby, we aim to adopt a theoretically grounded, data-driven approach to model selection. The novel criterion is named the backwards validated information criterion (BVIC) . The BVIC identifies suitable models by trading off a measure of goodness-of-fit and a models ability to predict backwards. We test the performance of the BVIC by conducting experiments on synthetic and real data. In each experiment, the BVIC is examined in contrast to conventionally employed criteria. Our experimental results suggest that the BVIC has comparable performance as conventional information criteria. Specifically, in most of the experiments performed, we did not find statistically significant differences between the forecast error of the BVIC under certain parameterizations and that of the different information criteria. Nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing that the BVIC guarantees are established by design where the model order penalization term depends on strong mathematical properties of time-reversible time series forecasting properties and a finite data assessment. In particular, the penalization term is replaced by a weighted trade-off between functional dimensions pertaining to forecasting.That said, we observed that the BVIC recovered more accurately the real order of the underlying process than the other criteria, which rely on a static penalization of the model order. Lastly, leveraging the latter property we perform the assessment of the order model (or, memory) of time series pertaining to epileptic seizures recorded using electrocorticographic data. Our results provide converging evidence that the order of the model increases during the epileptic events.},

Illegal access to automobiles via. the car’s integrated network system is quite a common phenomenon nowadays. Thus, it is essential to identify drivers on the basis of their driving patterns. Henceforth, this paper presents a driver profiling and identification method based on data acquired from car sensors. In-vehicle sensors generate dozens of operational data streams, and identifying the right representative features for driver profiling is a challenging task. Therefore, in our work to capture human driving behavior dynamics, we have designed a framework based on Long Short Term Memory. Moreover, for extracting relevant and independent features from the Controller Area Network (CAN) dataset, we suggested using feature selection algorithms. The proposed framework is evaluated on the publicly available vehicle CAN OBD-II dataset. While we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, an essential objective of this study is to verify that inter-driver heterogeneity and intra-driver homogeneity can be modeled using time series dependency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The main goal of this paper is to show how it is possible to modify a previously created model of a software-intensive system for the production of stereoscopic multimedia content defined by generalized nets (GN) without disturbing its static structure. When the system is structurally complex, any disruption of the static structure of the system can produce side effects on the rest of the system’s functionality. Generalized nets, as a powerful theoretical mathematical tool widely accepted for modeling systems from educational and biological to industrial and organisational ones, enable the analysis of static, dynamic and temporal characteristics of the modeled system. The existing GN model, according to the theory of generalized nets, can be modified by dropping or adding places, even entire transitions. This assumes a disruption of the static structure of a GN model and cannot be suitable for situations when similar but essentially different solutions need to be made using the GN model. For this purpose, the possibility of generalized nets to manage the capacities of places in transition have been used in this paper. In order to solve this problem, five most common cases of stereoscopic content production have been defined here: real-time studio production (live programme from the studio), realization of a sports event—live, post-production services (processing of other people’s stereoscopic material), subtitling/over synchronization and realization of a film programme—showing. For each case of the model usage non-necessary characteristics received by tokens in different places are defined. In accordance with GN methodology places with corresponding characteristics are eliminated for particular use-case by setting capacity function to zero.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The dynamics of molecular systems can be studied with time-resolved spectroscopy combined with model-based analysis. A Python framework for global and target analysis of time-resolved spectra is introduced with the help of three case studies. The first study, concerning broadband absorption of intersystem crossing in 4-thiothymidine, demonstrates the framework's ability to resolve vibrational wavepackets with a time resolution of ≈10 fs using damped oscillations and their associated spectra and phases. Thereby, a parametric description of the “coherent artifact” is crucial. The second study addresses multichromophoric systems composed of two perylene bisimide chromophores. Here, pyglotaran's guidance spectra and lego-like model composition enable the integration of spectral and kinetic properties of the parent chromophores, revealing a loss process, the undesired production of a radical pair, that reduces the light harvesting efficiency. In the third, time-resolved emission case study of whole photosynthetic cells, a megacomplex containing ≈500 chromophores of five different types is described by a combination of the kinetic models for its elements. As direct fitting of the data by theoretical simulation is unfeasible, our global and target analysis methodology provides a useful ‘middle ground’ where the theoretical description and the fit of the experimental data can meet. The pyglotaran framework enables the lego-like creation of kinetic models through its modular design and seamless integration with the rich Python ecosystem, particularly Jupyter notebooks. With extensive documentation and a robust validation framework, pyglotaran ensures accessibility and reliability for researchers, serving as an invaluable tool for understanding complex molecular systems.

Firstly, the dynamic model of the vehicle is transformed into five control-oriented subsystems. Then, the improved fixed-time sliding mode observer is used to estimate the uncertainties caused by elastic effects, external disturbances and actuator faults, these uncertainties are further compensated in the integral terminal sliding mode control laws. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed, the result shows that the designed control system is asymptotically stable. Compared with the disturbance observer-based robust backstepping control system, the designed control system has great advantages in settling time and control efforts, and has strong robustness to multisource disturbances and actuator faults.},

  abstract     = {Reliability analysis can be particularly challenging when performance functions require time-consuming simulations. Such simulations often involve multiple fidelity sources. This paper aims to enhance the efficiency of reliability analysis by leveraging multiple sample datasets with varying sources of fidelity. Firstly, this paper extends the GP model to integrate multiple low fidelity data into high fidelity predictions. In order to consider the correlations among data from different fidelity sources, the latent space representation from LMGP is introduced into the correlation matrix of different fidelity data. This multi-fidelity GP model is referred to as a latent map multi-fidelity Kriging (LMmfK). The effectiveness of LMmfK is validated through 1-dimensional analytical test and 8-dimensional Borehole test. Secondly, based on LMmfK, this paper proposes an active learning point-selected strategy suitable for scenarios with multiple fidelity sources, referred to as mfUEFF. The mfUEFF strategy intelligently selects the best data points from multiple fidelity sources, leveraging the benefits of both global improvement and local uncertainty. This integration enhances the efficiency and accuracy of reliability analysis. Two classic cases demonstrate that the proposed reliability method demonstrates superior computational accuracy and efficiency compared to other reliability methods. Finally, this paper applies the proposed method to the static reliability analysis of gears, involving time-consuming finite element models. Engineering application demonstrates that this method significantly improves efficiency, especially in scenarios with multiple fidelity sources.},

  abstract     = {Structural optimization of crash-related problems usually involves nonlinearities in geometry, material, and contact. The Equivalent Static Load (ESL) method provides a method to solve such problems. It has previously been extended to employ an individual Finite Element model describing the deformed geometry at each considered time step under the name Difference-based Equivalent Static Load (DiESL) method. This paper demonstrates how an appropriate selection of the time steps in each cycle can further improve the convergence behavior of the DiESL method. It is shown that the adaptive selection of time steps leads to better objective values and more reliable convergence to the presumed global optimum. Furthermore, the DiESL extension enables the adaption of path-dependent structural properties of the original nonlinear problem like material stiffness in each linear auxiliary load case. In this paper, an adaption of the Young’s modulus on element level in the linear auxiliary problem corresponding to the local plasticization in the nonlinear dynamic problem is successfully implemented. Here, the test examples indicate that an observable improvement can only be obtained if neither the elements in the elastic nor in the plastic range are dominating the structure’s behavior.},

We show that the long-time average values of transmission functions can be used as a stability marker of the equilibrium.

  abstract     = {Climate change and human activities are closely linked with the nutrient accumulation in sediments, but the role of influence factors and the driving mechanisms are unclear. Here, by using the generalized additive model (GAM), we investigated the contributions and driving mechanisms of climate change and human activities on TON, TN, and TP accumulation in sediments of typical lakes in the Huai River basin (Nansi Lake and Hongze Lake) from 1988 to 2018. The impacts of factors, such as air temperature (AT), real GDP per capita (GDP), population density (PD), crop sown area (CSA), artificial impervious area (AIA), and domestic sewage discharge (DSD) were considered in this study. The results of the multivariate GAM showed that the sediment variables were significantly affected by climate change in Nansi Lake, but not in Hongze Lake. AT and DSD contributed the most to the variation of sediment TOC in Nansi Lake, while the most critical factors affecting TN and TP were AT, PD and DSD. PD and CSA showed strong ability to explain the change of TOC in Hongze Lake, while CSA and DSD showed strong ability to explain the variations of TN and TP. The results show that the selected optimal multivariate GAM can well quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on nutrient enrichment in lake sediments. Effective recommendations are provided for decision-makers in developing water quality management plans to prevent eutrophication outbreaks in lake waters by targeting and controlling key factors.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is crucial in time series analysis for identifying abnormal events. To address the limitations of traditional methods in integrating spatiotemporal correlations and modeling normal patterns, we propose a Time Series Anomaly Detection Model Based on Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (TADST). First, the Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion Network (STF) combines temporal convolutional networks and graph attention influence networks to capture temporal dynamic dependencies and attribute correlations respectively, facilitating joint spatiotemporal feature modeling. Then, the Time Series Reconstruction Network (TSR) employs a multi-layer encoder-decoder architecture to learn the normal sample distribution and amplify discrepancies between reconstructed and anomalous data. Finally, the Anomaly Detection Mechanism (ADM) identifies anomalies by fitting the tail distribution of reconstruction deviations. When the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold, the mechanism updates the parameters of the Generalized Pareto Distribution, keeping the detection criteria adaptive. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed TADST achieves state-of-the-art results on five publicly available datasets.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of photovoltaic (PV) power generation plays a critical role in optimizing production schedules for PV power stations and facilitating efficient maintenance and repair of PV equipment. Deep time series forecasting models have emerged as the leading approach in the field of time series prediction. However, the intricate architectures and numerous parameters in these models frequently lead to forecasts that conflict with established domain knowledge. Furthermore, domain experts face significant challenges in leveraging their specialized knowledge to enhance the predictive performance of these models. Additionally, when dealing with PV strings exhibiting diverse characteristics, it becomes particularly challenging to identify discrepancies in the model’s predictive accuracy across different strings and pinpointing its performance flaws. To tackle the issues, we propose a domain knowledge-driven forecasting method that combines the deep time series forecasting model with decision tree regression. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method yields substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive visual analytics system. This system aids experts in forecasting PV string power generation trends by employing multi-perspective model evaluation techniques to assess the rationality of forecasts. It also incorporates domain knowledge through an interactive decision tree construction process, thereby enhancing the model’s predictive capabilities. The efficacy of our proposed system is substantiated through in-depth case studies and rigorous user evaluations. Graphical abstract},

  abstract     = {The influences of chaotic activity and time delay on the transmission of the sub-threshold signal (STS) in a single FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron and coupled neuronal networks are studied. It is found that a moderate chaotic activity level can enhance the system’s detection and transmission of STS. This phenomenon is known as chaotic resonance (CR). In a single neuron, the large amplitude and small period of the STS have a positive effect on the CR phenomenon. In the coupled neuronal network, however, the signal transmission performance of chemical synapses is better than that of electrical synapses. The time delay can determine the trend of the system response, and the multiple chaotic resonances phenomenon is observed upon fine-tuning the time delay length. Both sub-harmonic chaotic resonance and chaotic anti-resonance appear when the STS period and time delay are locked. In chained networks, the signal transmission performance between electrical synapses attenuates continuously. Conversely, the performance between chemical synapses reaches a steady state.},

Furthermore, the Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative is usually adopted in time-fractional Black–Scholes equations, while rigorous numerical analysis for Riemann–Liouville variable-order fractional problems are rarely founded in the literature.

  abstract     = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a framework employing Lock-in amplifier for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings using vibration signals, addressing the challenges posed by noise interference and inaccurate estimation of Lock-in amplifier’s reference frequency. Methods By studying the properties of the pulse chains triggered by faults, the proposed framework utilizes the Short-time Variance of vibration signals to determine the bearing fault characteristic frequency, providing a reliable reference frequency for the Lock-in amplifier. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of previous methods reliant on geometric relationships for fault frequency estimation. Results It has been proved that Short-time Variance can effectively identify sparse pulses in vibration signals. The Short-time Variance spectrum effectively characterizes bearing fault information and outperforms the benchmark method envelope spectrum in high-noise environments. Validation of the proposed framework is conducted using simulated signals and experimental data sourced from a public dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in accurately diagnosing bearing faults through vibration signals. Conclusion This study confirms that directly applying theoretical fault characteristic frequencies as the reference frequency for a Lock-in amplifier can have a significant negative impact on diagnostic performance. It has been concluded that the proposed framework offers a robust approach to fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. By leveraging Lock-in amplifiers and the Short-time Variance, it provides accurate fault detection, thus ensuring the safe and reliable operation of mechanical equipment.},

The 6-DOF attitude tracking control of HFVs is a great challenge due to the extreme flight environment, the complexity of hypersonic aerodynamics, and serious coupling. The FTSC is proposed with a norm-normalized signum function. By ensuring ratio persistence between state variable components, fixed-time synchronization is achieved, which brings the controller a smoother converging scheme, and the impact of disturbances between coupled channels is inhibited. In addition, model uncertainties and disturbances are handled with an extended disturbance observer, with a rapid converging procedure that synchronization properties proceed. Stability analysis is established with Lyapunov techniques and the fixed-time stability theory. Lastly, numerical simulations are carried out to show the feasibility and priorities under comparison.},

The influence mechanism of time-delayed feedback on the bifurcation of the deterministic system is discussed through parameter bifurcation diagrams and phase diagrams. For the system with noise disturbance, both Lévy noise and time-delayed feedback can significantly control stochastic P-bifurcation. Furthermore, we calculated the mean square voltage (MSV) of the system with several different time-delayed feedback parameters to find an effective way to enhance the energy harvesting performance. When other parameters remain unchanged, the optimal time-delayed feedback parameters can be selected to maximize the MSV. In addition, the first escape probability (FEP) is calculated to reveal the transition mechanism of the system from the low-amplitude region to the high-amplitude region. The results show that the time-delayed feedback can control the system to escape to a larger amplitude region. This research hopes to provide a theoretical reference for the design of high-performance energy harvesters.},

  abstract     = {Complexity Theory is highly interdisciplinary, therefore, any regularities must hold on all levels of organization, independent on the nature of the system. An open question in science is how complex systems self-organize to produce emergent structures and properties, a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It has long been known that there is a quantity-quality transition in natural systems. This is to say that the properties of a system depend on its size. More recently, this has been termed the size-complexity rule, which means that to increase their size, systems must increase their complexity, and that to increase their complexity they must grow in size. This rule goes under different names in different disciplines and systems of different nature, such as the area-speciation rule, economies of scale, scaling relations (allometric) in biology and for cities, and many others. We apply the size-complexity rule to stars to compare them with other complex systems in order to find universal patterns of self-organization independent of the substrate. Here, as a measure of complexity of a star, we are using the degree of grouping of nucleons into atoms, which reduces nucleon entropy, increases the variety of elements, and changes the structure of the star. As seen in our previous work, complexity, using action efficiency, is in power law proportionality of all other characteristics of a complex system, including its size. Here we find that, as for the other systems studied, the complexity of stars is in a power law proportionality with their size—the bigger a system is, the higher its level of complexity is—despite differing explosion energies and initial metallicities from simulations and data, which confirms the size-complexity rule and our model.},

  abstract     = {Complex Fault Block Reservoir (CFBR) is one of the main types of oil reservoir in the eastern oilfields of China, and it is in the stage of ultra-high water cut development. The description of Complex Fault Block Reservoir has aroused wild attention of experts and scholars. As the waterflood multiple of old oilfields increases, the physical properties of reservoirs change, and the distribution of remaining oil becomes more dispersed. Meanwhile, the potential of reservoirs is more vulnerable to the effects of small and micro terranes, reservoir heterogeneity and differential seepage field. Therefore, based on the fine reservoir description, a high-precision reservoir description technology is proposed in this article. By using the high precision reservoir description technology, not only the research objectives are more accurate, but also the ultra-high water cut characteristic of complex fault block oilfield is more highlighted in the research. In addition, the research methods are developing towards intelligence. High precision reservoir description technology is the continuation and elevation of fine reservoir description technology, which will play an important role in the deep development of old oilfields.},

  abstract     = {In the development of the spacecraft system, reliability analysis is often performed independently of the system design, and its input is usually an artificial abstract of the design scheme, such as function trees or block diagrams. This model gap between analysis and design lead to uncertainty in the results, while the conclusions are difficult to feed directly into the system design. In addition, manual reliability analysis consumes a lot of time and effort, while also increase the risk of errors. With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of spacecraft systems, reliability analysis is becoming increasingly challenging and its value is difficult to show. To cope with these difficulties, model-based systems engineering has emerged. However, MBSE focuses on requirements for traceability without a precise definition of reliability, resulting that the model conversion is still needed. In order to truly exploit the advantages of MBSE, this paper proposes a system design framework integrated reliability analysis for complex spacecraft system using MBSE. Both the design and reliability analysis are based on a single SysML model, from which FMEA and fault tree analysis can be generated directly. This framework ensures the consistency of the system model and the reliability model, eliminating the model conversion and reducing the workload of manual analysis. In this paper, the application process of a simple case is also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Social networks reflect the relationships and interactions between individuals and have played a significant role in the spread of information, in which the communication of ideas and sharing of opinions happen all the time. There are various examples of how social networks can affect the behavior of individuals, like viral marketing, the spread of memes, and the propagation of fake news. This dynamic of information diffusion has motivated the research of several approaches to identify the prominent influencers in a network. The Influence Maximization Problem consists of identifying a subset S , called a seed set, of at most k elements to achieve the maximum (expected) propagation through a diffusion model, with S as the initial influencers on a network. It demonstrated that the influence maximization problem is an NP-hard optimization problem. Therefore, it is unfeasible to identify the subset S that ensures the most extensive diffusion due to its complexity. The most typical approach to this problem is using approximate algorithms, highlighting the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF), about 700 times faster than the greedy strategy proposed by Kemp et al., and CELF++, which presents a runtime gain of between 35 to 55},

  abstract     = {The prediction of time to slope failure (TOF) is one of the most pivotal concerns for both geological risk researchers and practitioners. Conventional inverse velocity method (IVM), based on the analysis of displacement monitoring data, has become an effective method to solve this problem because it is easy to perform and the prediction results are generally acceptable. Practically, some limitations like random instrumental noise, environmental noise, and measurement error are ubiquitous factors hampered the reliability of the prediction. In this work, traditional IVM method and modified IVM with three different filters are respectively detected on velocity time series from an landslide event in an open-pit coal mine with the propose of improving, in retrospect, the accuracy of failure predictions. Simultaneously, the effects of noise on the appraisal of IVM graphics are also assessed and explanation. The results demonstrate that the sliding process of landslides can be divided into three signature stages based on the IVM. Noteworthily, the slope failure critical point occurs at the end of the progressive stage and generally coincides with a major acceleration event in which almost integrity of the slope is lost, transitioning to a linear trend ever since. Additionally, the short-term smoothing filter (SSF) and long-term smoothing filter (LSF) models can provide more accuracy and useful information about the probable failure time. Finally, with the intention of enhancing the feasible use of the method and supporting pre-determined response plans, two-level alert procedures combing SSF and LSF are proposed. Graphical abstract},

Aiming at the problem that the complexity of surface measurement in traditional methods is only judged by subjective experience and is difficult to calculate, an image-based surface measurement complexity (SMC) quantitative model is proposed. First, according to the curved surfaces’ characteristics during the OMM process, the concept of SMC is introduced by analyzing several key factors. Then, the curvature and smoothness information of three-dimensional surfaces is converted into two-dimensional images’ information by using the conformal mapping with dimensionality reduction. Next, based on the image color and texture complexity calculation, a mathematical model combined with the area and profile correction coefficients is established. Finally, the SMC model’s validity is verified by a set of design-machining-inspection experiments on curved surfaces, and the relevant laws between the SMC and measurement efficiency and measurement accuracy are presented.},

  abstract     = {Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a fundamental approach for the end-to-end use of digital models in the development of complex systems. The aviation industry in particular, where system complexity is constantly increasing, needs new concepts and methods to overcome ecological and socio-economic challenges. Therefore, domain-specific models are needed for the design and evaluation of systems to support the various system investigations, such as requirements management, installation space optimization, or failure analyses. An end-to-end coupling and linking of these mostly heterogeneous systems offer many advantages (e.g. shorter development times) over working with isolated digital sub-models, natural language documents, and purely physical prototypes. In addition, digitalization allows global and interdisciplinary collaboration of multiple teams of experts on the same virtual product. Since this approach is particularly promising for the configuration of aircraft cabins, a virtual development platform is developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for the conceptual design of the aircraft cabin and its systems. As a result, virtual prototypes of cabin configurations are quickly generated to allow new concepts to be visualized and investigated at an early design stage. Extending the conceptual cabin system design process with a functional system architecture and executable system architecture models promotes information traceability, early failure detection, and requirements verification. The methodology used for this purpose is presented in this paper. The systems modeling language (SysML) is used to build a model for the functional depiction of cabin systems and to link it to existing models of the conceptual cabin design process. The modeling is performed exemplarily for the passenger service functions. Subsequently, the results are automatically transferred to the virtual development platform to experience the generated cabin concept.},

Gaussian process (GP) models, also known as Kriging, are a common choice of emulators, and optimal experimental designs should be used to improve their accuracy. Specifically, space-filling designs are widely used in the literature, which proved to be efficient under GP models. In this chapter, we review different types of GP models as well as various kinds of space-filling designs.

  abstract     = {In the contemporary age of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where software governs the control, coordination, and management of physical objects to tackle real-world problems, engineering requirements for such systems present considerable challenges. Consequently, it is not surprising that the requirements engineering (RE) community, encompassing both academia and industry, has turned to established RE methodologies and applied them within the context of CPS; notably, Jackson’s Problem Frames (PF) approach deploys problem diagrams for modeling CPS. However, problem diagrams of realistic CPS often present visual and conceptual complexities, which must be addressed before PF can be usefully applied in practice. In this paper, the above problem is addressed in two steps: firstly, preliminary findings are presented by deriving from the application of eye-tracking software in the assessment of a technique designed to mitigate the visual complexity inherent in the CARE (Computer-Aided Requirements Engineering) tool developed for PF. An auto-layout technique is developed for detecting and resolving overlaps, aimed at enhancing its usability from the perspectives of cognition, psychology, and user studies; secondly, the technique of a complexity matrix is applied for calculating and evaluating the conceptual complexity inherent in problem diagrams. Our eye-tracking results show the successful implementation of overlap detection and resolution. The case studies in the second step also demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the complexity matrix calculations.},

Different segmentation schemes can be achieved flexibly using a blank holding system driven by electromagnetics. However, how to segment the blank holder to fulfill the demand for flow control of complex parts is still an obstacle to overcome. This paper proposes a flow rate-based design of distributed blank holders on demand for complex parts. A theoretical model is first established to analyze the differences in flow rate in the flange. Then, the flow rates are identified circumferentially and radially to find the locations where the changes in rates are large, and these locations are lined and deemed as the boundaries for segmenting holders. Moreover, a design implementation, including location identification and the electromagnetic system configuration for complex parts, is developed to explore the optimal segmentation schemes. To validate the effectiveness, the downscaling part of a car door with the material DP600 is selected to find the segmented scheme, and the corresponding prototypes of integral and segmented electromagnetic dies are then configured. Experimental results show that the thickening ratio is decreased by 15.4},

By building human gut communities coupled with computational modelling, we dissect the effects of fibres that vary in chemical complexity and each of their constituent sugars on community assembly and response to perturbations. We demonstrate that the degree of chemical complexity across different fibres limits microbial growth and the number of species that can utilize these nutrients. The prevalence of negative interspecies interactions is reduced in the presence of fibres compared with their constituent sugars. Carbohydrate chemical complexity enhances the reproducibility of community assembly and resistance of the community to invasion. We demonstrate that maximizing or minimizing carbohydrate competition between resident and invader species enhances resistance to invasion. In sum, the quantitative effects of carbohydrate chemical complexity on microbial interaction networks could be exploited to inform dietary and bacterial interventions to modulate community resistance to perturbations.},

  abstract     = {For the coordinated on-machine measurement of curved surfaces, the accurate prediction of the number of measuring points (MPs) could provide an important theoretical time basis for machining-inspection planning, workshop production scheduling, etc. To address the problem that the prediction of the required number of MPs for curved surfaces in relation to their complexity, machining accuracy, and other ambiguous characteristics, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the input and output variables of the prediction model are defined as the surface measurement descriptor (SMD) by analyzing the impact indicators when measuring complex surfaces. Then, the IPSO algorithm with adaptive weights and particle acceleration updates is applied to optimize the ANFIS model with an organic composition of fuzzy logic knowledge and neuronal network. Finally, the prediction ability of the back propagation (BP) model, ANFIS model, and several ANFIS models optimized by the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was evaluated based on 77 groups of sample data collected from the machining-inspection experiment. The empirical results indicate that the proposed IPSO-ANFIS model with an optimal root mean square error of 2.708 and determination coefficient of 0.9855 has a higher prediction ability than GOA-ANFIS, PSO-ANFIS, DE-ANFIS, GA-ANFIS, SVM-ANFIS, ANFIS and BP models, and appears to be an effective and reliable tool for estimating the number of MPs on complex curved surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Earthquakes can cause widely distributed slope failures and damage in mountainous areas. The accurate prediction of ground motions in mountainous areas is essential for managing the seismic risk of urban cities near mountains but is restricted primarily by complex seismic site amplification effects in areas of uneven terrain. This study selected Qiaozhuang town located in the Qingchuan—Pingwu fault zone, Southwest China, as a case study. A simulator for mapped seismic responses using a hybrid model (SiSeRHMap) was applied to compute the multispectral seismic topographic amplification maps at the three slope units surrounding Qiaozhuang town (Weigan hill, Mt. Dong, and Mt. Shizi). Post-earthquake damage survey maps, 1D seismic site response spectral ratios, and H/V spectral ratios of earthquake data were used to validate the computed seismic site amplification factors and resonance frequencies. The results suggest that strong topographic amplification effects usually occur at distinct slope locations, such as hilltops, convex slope positions, upslope, and narrow ridges. The computed topographic amplification factors in the study area reached up to 2.4 at upslope or hilltops, and the resonance frequencies were between 3 and 10 Hz. Topographic effects can be as important as stratigraphic effects when assessing seismic amplification effects in the study area. We conclude that both topographic and stratigraphic effects should be considered in the comprehensive seismic hazard assessment of the study area or other similar mountain towns.},

Current research lacks a common understanding of which architectural components are needed to create assistive systems that use models at runtime. Existing descriptions of architectural components are focused on particular domains, consider only some parts of an assistive system, or do not consider models at runtime. We have analyzed common functional requirements for such systems to be able to propose a set of reusable components, which have to be considered when creating assistive systems that use models. Such components constitute a reference architecture that we propose within this paper. To validate the proposed architecture, we have expressed the architectures of two assistive systems from different domains, namely assistance for elderly people and assistance for operators in smart manufacturing in terms of compliance with such architecture. The proposed reference architecture will facilitate the creation of future assistive systems.},

  abstract     = {Climate change, energy transition, population growth and other natural and anthropogenic impacts, combined with outdated (unfashionable) infrastructure, can force Dam and Reservoir Systems (DRS) operation outside of the design envelope (adverse operating conditions). Since there is no easy way to redesign or upgrade the existing DRSs to mitigate against all the potential failure situations, Digital Twins (DT) of DRSs are required to assess system’s performance under various what-if scenarios. The current state of practice in failure modelling is that failures (system’s not performing at the expected level or not at all) are randomly created and implemented in simulation models. That approach helps in identifying the riskiest parts (subsystems) of the DRS (risk-based approach), but does not consider hazards leading to failures, their occurrence probabilities or subsystem failure exposure. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a more realistic failure scenario generator based on a causal approach. Here, the novel failure simulation approach utilizes fuzzy logic reasoning to create DRS failures based on hazard severity and subsystems’ reliability. Combined with the system dynamics (SD) model this general failure simulation tool is designed to be used with any DRS. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated using the Pirot DRS case study in Serbia over a 10-year simulation period. Results show that even occasional hazards (as for more than 97},

  abstract     = {Complexity is often regarded as a “problem” to solve. Instead of attempting to solve complexity, we follow systems engineering practices and switch back to the problem domain, where a major obstacle is the impossibility to universally define complexity. As a workaround, we explored complexity characterization and its existing shortcomings, including: lack of standardization, inconsistent semantics, system-centricity, insufficiently transparent reasoning, and lack of validation. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a compilatory framework to characterize complexity using the Five Ws information-gathering method. The answer to the WHO question proposed four complexity viewpoints; the answer to the WHY question proposed a two-dimensional structure for complexity drivers; and the answer to the WHAT question derived generalized complexity challenges. As a preliminary step to show the potential of the framework to characterize complexity, we used and validated it as a tool to structure general literature related to complexity. In general, our findings suggest that papers with complexity solutions do not frame their research within the complexity problem domain, hindering the contribution evaluation. Through the viewpoints, we identified general research gaps of six solution directions. From the drivers, we noted three observations in the discourse of complexity origins: (1) a system-driven tendency, (2) a preference for concreteness vs. abstraction, and (3) an unclear distinction between origins and effects. Through the challenges’ findings we explored two hypotheses: (1) a system-centric preference; and (2) a solution-oriented vision, both of which were supported by the results (most challenges relate to the system viewpoint and challenges are defined based on solution directions).},

As a result, the traditional model is not sufficient to describe the functional failure mode of complex crosslinking systems. In this paper, a metamodel-based complex crosslinking system modeling method is proposed and applied to build the model for airborne complex crosslinking system. The influencing factors and relationships between system functions and faults are studied, and a metamodel-based fault example of airborne complex crosslinking system is realized.The application of metamodel technology to the establishment of airborne complex crosslinking system model can make the subsystem model achieve a higher level of abstraction. The good general performance of metamodel solves the problem of complex system model reuse, provides quantitative support for subsequent development, and simplifies the correlation characteristics of airborne complex system crosslinking function. It provides the foundation of domain model for simulation, design and development of subsequent systems.},

  abstract     = {Market competition has a role that is directly or indirectly associated with the influential effects of individual sectors on other sectors of the financial market. The present work studies the relative position of stocks in the market through the identification of influential spreaders and their corresponding effect on the other sectors of the market using complex network analysis during and after the COVID-19-induced lockdown periods. The study uses daily data of NSE along with those of different countries like USA (Nasdaq), UK (UK stock exchange), Japan (Nikkei) and Brazil (Bovespa) from December 2019 to June 2021. The existing network approaches using different centrality measures failed to distinguish between the positive and negative influences of the different sectors in the market which act as spreaders. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an effective measure called LIEST (Local Influential Effects for a Specific Target) that can examine the positive and negative influences separately with respect to any period. LIEST considers the combined impact of all possible nodes which are at most three steps away from the specific target nodes in the networks. This study considers the transmission of financial influence originating at a source node (a particular stock) and propagating to target nodes through the financial market modeled as a complex network where the structure of the network is captured by correlation. The essence of non-linearity in the network dynamics without considering the single node effect becomes visible in the proposed network. A comparative analysis has been undertaken among the stocks drawn from financial markets around the world (USA, UK, Brazil and Japan) with that of the Indian stock to obtain an idea about the global market behaviour. As an example, the active participation of healthcare and consumer defensive sectors along with financial, industrial and technology sectors have been found to create an effective positive impact on the Indian market. Similar results have been obtained with stock market data obtained from other countries. In addition, in respect of spreading performance the proposed approach is found to be efficient as validated by the TRIVALENCY model.},

This would ultimately improve the accessibility and impact of ABM as a tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems.

The approach condenses the characteristics of the dataset. LSTM combines with social network methods derived from specific datasets to complete the classification task, and then use complex network structure evolution methods to discover dynamic social attributes. The experimental results show that this method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and achieve better classification results.

  abstract     = {As military reforms continue to develop, the battlefield environment is becoming increasingly complex, and traditional single-service combat methods have evolved into integrated joint and collaborative information operations that break down service boundaries on land, sea, and air. The level of weapon system confrontation has also evolved into a system-to-system confrontation. Traditional document-based system architecture design methods can no longer address the complexity and emergent challenges of weapon system construction. In this paper, based on model-driven system engineering, an open, integrated, model-driven weapon equipment interaction system that supports human interaction was constructed using the SysML modeling language and Magicdraw modeling tool. The Unreal Engine 4 landscape building function was used to construct a virtual battlefield environment, and a communication server was developed using C# language to perform visual simulation of interoperability between weapon systems. Based on model-driven weapon equipment interoperability, visual simulation is used to ensure that the function of the weapon equipment system meets the requirements of combat and the combat effectiveness of the system is maximized.},

  abstract     = {In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with single- antenna user equipment (SAUE) or multiple-antenna user equipment (MAUE), with the increase of the number of received antennas at base station, the complexity of traditional detectors is also increasing. In order to reduce the high complexity of parallel running of the traditional Gauss-Seidel iterative method, this paper proposes a model-driven deep learning detector network, namely Block Gauss-Seidel Network (BGS-Net), which is based on the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. We reduce complexity by converting a large matrix inversion to small matrix inversions. In order to improve the symbol error ratio (SER) of BGS-Net under MAUE system, we propose Improved BGS-Net. The simulation results show that, compared with the existing model-driven algorithms, BGS-Net has lower complexity and similar the detection performance; good robustness, and its performance is less affected by changes in the number of antennas; Improved BGS-Net can improve the detection performance of BGS-Net.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in foundation models have significantly enhanced the robustness and scalability of traditional methods in a variety of domains. However, their application to specialized ecological environments, where challenges such as data scarcity, camouflage, and environmental noise persist, remains an area requiring further exploration. This study investigates the application of foundation models in species monitoring within complex ecological systems, with a focus on juvenile Tri-spine horseshoe crabs ( Tachypleus tridentatus ) in Hong Kong’s intertidal zones. Traditional methods for monitoring these endangered species are labor-intensive, imprecise, and disruptive to fragile ecosystems, particularly in environments where juveniles exhibit excellent camouflage and small-scale behavioral markers. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising solution, yet their use in these settings is hampered by tidal movements, water turbidity, and complex backgrounds. To address these challenges, we apply a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), to UAV-based high-resolution imagery. By leveraging expert knowledge to design and extract domain-specific features, we fine-tune SAM2 using a few-shot learning strategy, enhancing its ability to accurately segment foraging trails with limited data. The fine-tuned model incorporates interpretable morphological features, such as trail length, width, and continuity, to distinguish biological trails from environmental noise, thereby improving both model robustness and interpretability. This approach demonstrates the efficacy of adapting foundation models for domain-specific challenges, advancing both the interpretability and reliability of ecological monitoring systems. The resulting species distribution maps provide valuable insights into population patterns, offering a scalable and transferable solution for monitoring endangered species in dynamic, data-scarce environments. This research highlights the potential of foundation models to revolutionize ecological monitoring by improving model trustworthiness and extending their application to complex, real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Requirements modeling is often the first step in the development of complex products related to the fields of aviation, aerospace, and shipping. Requirements changes are made throughout the entire lifecycle of complex product development, making it critical to effectively track, manage, and quickly validate requirements. Existing requirements modeling, tracking and verification for complex products often require the collaboration of system-level modeling language SysML and physical-level modeling languages Modelica and Matlab/Simulink, which makes it difficult to track requirements and design products and maintain consistency. To address this problem, this paper proposes a requirement automatic verification method and system based on X language. It can realize the automatic derivation, tracing and verification of the relationship between requirements and design artifacts. First, rules for mining the implicit requirement relationships are defined, a requirement relationship tracking method is proposed based on the rules, and the vertical tracking relationship between requirements and design artifacts is established. Then, the relevant design artifacts are modeled and simulated using X language to verify the target requirements. Based on the above method, a requirement tracking system is developed, which can effectively support the tracking and verification of requirement relationships. Finally, this paper verifies the feasibility and advantages of this automatic requirement verification method and system by using a traffic model as an example.},

Effective and correct management of water resources constitutes an effective and important issue among scales. In this sense, a precise estimation of streamflow time series in rivers is one of the most important issues in optimal management of surface water resources. Therefore, a hybrid method combining particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) are proposed to predict flow with data obtained from different flow measurement stations. In this respect, the data gathered from three Flow Measurement Stations (FMS) from Zamanti and Eğlence rivers located on Seyhan Basin are utilized. Besides, the proposed LSTM-PSO method is compared to an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and the LSTM benchmark model to demonstrate the performance achievement of proposed method. The prediction performances of the developed hybrid model and the others are tested on the determined stations. The forecasting performances of the models are determined with RMSE, MAE, MAPE, SD, and R^2 metrics. The comparison results indicated that the LSTM-PSO method provides highest results with values of R^2 (≈ 0.9433), R^2 (≈ 0.6972), and R^2 (≈ 0.9273) for the Değirmenocağı, Eğribük, and Ergenusagi FMS data, respectively.},

Therefore, efficiently scheduling these applications and optimizing resource usage in distributed and heterogeneous computing environments presents significant challenges. Existing scheduling solutions in edge and cloud environments has been less focus on proactive strategy to both handling the complex and dynamic nature of stream application scheduling. If exist are typically rely on either offline or online scheduling strategies. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a Proactive Stream Task Scheduling (PSTS), a novel ML-based task scheduling method for stream applications in edge-cloud environments. PSTS is a hybrid approach, balancing offline and online scheduling by employing time series and clustering models. To deal with NP-hardness of the problem an enhancement of Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) version for stream task scheduling is used. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSTS compared to competitive algorithms. The results show that PSTS has optimized fitness by 89},

Firstly, to track multiple targets, the proposed algorithm uses a prediction network and an update network based DLSTM, and defines the association gate by using the residual and corresponding covariance. Secondly, the valid measurements are extracted, and then the global nearest neighbor (GNN) algorithm is adopted to associate the data. Finally, the cardinal distribution theory is used to design a dynamic association gate, which can clear the accumulated historical states and historical measurements. Subsequently, the tracking process of the target is restarted when a maneuver is determined. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed M-MTIT-DLSTM algorithm is more robust near moments of the target maneuver, and the tracking accuracy is close to that of the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm with high operational efficiency compared with the current widely used IMM algorithm.},

Unfortunately, real cyber-physical systems are usually not implemented to easily address these techniques. One of the most frequent problems to face is transforming acquired data, often heterogeneous and unlabeled to allow the application of Process Mining technique. In this study, we propose an automatised and unsupervised methodology for extracting CaseIDs from an unlabeled event log. The proposed detection of CaseIDs is based on the definition of appropriate heuristic metrics, able to highlight the correlation between events that are part of the same process instance, according to temporal and topological features (e.g., kinds of functionally-related devices, topological distance, etc.). These features constitute the inputs for a clustering technique, which has been used to extract different cases. The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated on a real diagnostic management system to support the decisions in maintenance operations in railway infrastructures. The system has been reproduced and tested in Gematica’s laboratory for simulating the data used in this work.},

Tools to achieve this goal in the context of a ranking model based on multiple reference profiles are usually based on mixed-integer linear programming, Boolean satisfiability formulation or metaheuristics. However, they are usually unable to handle realistic problems involving many criteria and a large amount of input information.

Nature-inspired metaheuristic methods play an essential role in software testing, in which various studies have been conducted in this field; however, due to a lack of wide-ranging papers reviewing these methods, conducting a comprehensive systematic review to examine an array of crucial mechanisms in this field has become a necessity. This study aims to present a detailed analysis and taxonomically classifies the metaheuristic methods inspired by nature. This paper compromises a systematic literature review of 65 chosen studies published between 2015 and 2022. Genetic algorithm-based, hybrid, ant colony optimization-based, cuckoo search-based, firefly algorithm-based, artificial bee colony-based, and other metaheuristic methods constitute this systematic study’s stratification. Evaluation methods, applied tools, merits, and demerits of each reviewed article are investigated. Additionally, future directions and open issues are addressed. This conducted paper not only expounds on software testing strengths, open issues, and future works, but also recognizes the quest for optimizing the insufficient metrics in software testing, such as mutation score, complexity, and scalability, which would be the propulsion of the testing process if consummated.},

While solving CPP and RCPP, we are trying to minimize the total average latency and take the capacity of the controller, and load on the switch as constraints. Afterward, we simulated our proposed approach Varna Based Optimization (VBO), and compared it with other traditional population-based heuristic algorithms such as PSO, TLBO, Jaya, BOA, and WOA. It has been observed and found that VBO provides better results in comparison to others in most of the cases.

  abstract     = {Early-stage security analysis can be used for a preliminary assessment of the security level of a system, thus providing useful insights to guide the whole system’s development. In this paper, we focus on a specific meta-level modeling framework for security analysis, ADVISE Meta, which allows representing a system using generic built-in blocks and relationships constituting the ontology of the framework, and to automatically derive complex low-level stochastic models representing attack steps and adversaries. In this paper, we extend the ADVISE Meta ontology to enlarge the variety of the possible attack paths and adversaries that can be represented in the framework, by modeling (i) attack patterns available in the CAPEC database, a comprehensive dictionary of known patterns of attack, and (ii) the adversaries’ profiles defined in the Threat Agent Library (TAL), a reference library which describes the characteristics of threat agents. The paper provides a detailed description of the whole process for extending the ADVISE Meta ontology, and the application of the extended modeling framework for an early-stage security analysis of a public transport supervision system. The framework enables a variety of security-oriented analyses, in particular to assess the probability that a given adversary can successfully reach a specific goal, to analyze the most probable attack path that adversaries can follow to reach a goal, to perform sensitivity analysis at varying of attack patterns and adversaries’ profiles, to compare different architectural solutions, and to identify the system’s components that can be more probably attacked by adversaries.},

  abstract     = {Extractive summaries of legal judgments are invaluable due to their ability to preserve the original text, facilitating direct reference when required. Existing research on extractive summarization of Indian legal judgments predominantly employs supervised methodologies, which rely on extensive and often difficult-to-obtaining expert annotations. State-of-the-art methods that use role labels or rhetorical role labels are largely limited to supervised learning paradigms (Bhattacharya et al. in Identification of rhetorical roles of sentences in indian legal judgments, 2019). In this study, we propose an unsupervised approach, Unsupervised Role-Labelled Knapsack Summarizer ( URL KnapSum ), which eliminates the need for expert annotations while effectively scaling to larger datasets. Our methodology begins by clustering sentences to group them into thematic categories. An optimized selection of sentences is performed using a knapsack algorithm using the similarity scores and length constraints, ensuring cluster-level diversity and global coherence. We evaluate the URL KnapSum using ROUGE (Lin in ROUGE: a package for automatic evaluation of summaries. In: Text summarization branches out, Barcelona, Spain. Association for Computational Linguistics, pp 74–81, 2004) scores for supervised evaluation and Kendall’s tau (Puka in Kendall’s Tau. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, pp 713–715, 2011) and Spearman’s correlation (Sedgwick in BMJ: Br Med J 349:g7327, 2014) for unsupervised evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a novel, reference-free evaluation metric, the Top-K Analysis Metric , which benchmarks the algorithm by measuring consistency between document and summary similarities. The results demonstrate the superiority of URL KnapSum over existing supervised methods, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability.},

As these systems and their requirements evolve over time, an updated supervisor needs to be computed each time an adaptation takes place. We consider the case that a supervisor has been synthesized for a given model, after which this model is (slightly) adapted. We investigate how we can make use of the previous synthesis result, in order to more efficiently compute the supervisor for the adapted model. We introduce model deltas as a means to describe the difference between pairs of models. Using the model deltas, a notion of atomic adaptations is introduced. For these atomic adaptations, algorithms are provided to compute the supervisor for the adapted model in a transformational manner from the previous synthesis result, rather than performing a completely new synthesis. These atomic adaptations can be iterated over, to transformationally compute a supervisor for model deltas that contain a number of atomic adaptations. To improve efficiency, it is shown how atomic adaptations can be grouped together based on their required computations and be processed at the same time. A running example is used to support the explanations on the functioning of the algorithms. The efficiency of the method is evaluated by means of both an academic and an industrial use case.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing faults across different machines–known as cross-machine fault diagnosis–is a critical yet challenging task in industrial environments. To effectively address this issue, domain adaptation techniques have been explored to transfer diagnostic knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domains. However, cross-machine adaptation remains difficult due to limited labeled data and significant heterogeneity in machine types, operating conditions, and environmental settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework called Domain Adversarial Perturbation (DAP). The proposed method leverages spectrogram encoding to effectively handle vibration signals, making it especially suitable for scenarios with limited labeled data. Moreover, domain adversarial perturbations are introduced to reduce domain discrepancies between machines while preserving intra-machine class distinctions. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy based on spectrogram similarity further enhances the utilization of unlabeled data from the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on the CWRU, IMS, and HUST benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DAP method consistently achieves significant performance improvements and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various cross-machine adaptation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Recently, infrared small target detection with single-point supervision has attracted extensive attention. However, the detection accuracy of existing methods has difficulty meeting actual needs. Therefore, we propose an innovative refined infrared small target detection scheme with single-point supervision, which has excellent segmentation accuracy and detection rate. Specifically, we introduce label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework and explore the performance of various excellent infrared small target detection networks based on this framework. Meanwhile, to improve the comprehensive performance, we construct a complete post-processing strategy. On the one hand, to improve the segmentation accuracy, we use a combination of test-time augmentation (TTA) and conditional random field (CRF) for post-processing. On the other hand, to improve the detection rate, we introduce an adjustable sensitivity (AS) strategy for post-processing, which fully considers the advantages of multiple detection results and reasonably adds some areas with low confidence to the fine segmentation image in the form of centroid points. In addition, to further improve the performance and explore the characteristics of this task, on the one hand, we construct and find that a multi-stage loss is helpful for fine-grained detection. On the other hand, we find that a reasonable sliding window cropping strategy for test samples has better performance for actual multi-size samples. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Notably, the proposed scheme won the third place in the “ICPR 2024 Resource-Limited Infrared Small Target Detection Challenge Track 1: Weakly Supervised Infrared Small Target Detection”.},

  abstract     = {Human newborns are considered altricial compared with other primates because they are relatively underdeveloped at birth. However, in a broader comparative context, other mammals are more altricial than humans. It has been proposed that altricial development evolved secondarily in humans due to obstetrical or metabolic constraints, and in association with increased brain plasticity. To explore this association, we used comparative data from 140 placental mammals to measure how altriciality evolved in humans and other species. We also estimated how changes in brain size and gestation length influenced the timing of neurodevelopment during hominin evolution. Based on our data, humans show the highest evolutionary rate to become more altricial (measured as the proportion of adult brain size at birth) across all placental mammals, but this results primarily from the pronounced postnatal enlargement of brain size rather than neonatal changes. In addition, we show that only a small number of neurodevelopmental events were shifted to the postnatal period during hominin evolution, and that they were primarily related to the myelination of certain brain pathways. These results indicate that the perception of human altriciality is mostly driven by postnatal changes, and they point to a possible association between the timing of myelination and human neuroplasticity. Humans have the highest evolutionary rate towards becoming more altricial across all placental mammals, but this results primarily from postnatal enlargement of brain size rather than neonatal changes.},

The research methodology is based on the author's approach, which includes cognitive map analysis and a simplicial complex. The study was tested on two Information Technology companies in Russia. Based on the determination of the profit elasticity on the manageable vertices of outsourcing business models, the most attractive in terms of efficiency criterion in the form of profit is the outsourcing business model of developing in-house non-IT services. The analysis of structural connectivity made it possible to rank the factors by the level of importance for the preservation of the business model. Modeling the effectiveness of implementing the formed outsourcing business models provided an opportunity to increase profits for the investigated IT companies by increasing the number of single-type projects. The conducted modeling of changes in relations with customers in the studied IT enterprises shows the inexpediency of changing customer relations in BM3. It is proved that certain factors can be replaced without losing the integrity of the business model. The scientific contribution of this study is the proposed methodological approach for assessing the effectiveness of an outsourcing business model. Based on the application of this methodology, the strategic objectives are linked to the business model in the process of achieving them (the achievement of strategic objectives under the influence of the selected outsourcing business model is shown).},

Within software evolution and maintenance, quantum machine learning (QML) remains mostly an underexplored domain, particularly in addressing challenges such as detecting buggy software commits from code repositories. In this study, we investigate the practical application of quantum support vector classifiers (QSVC) for detecting buggy software commits across 14 open-source software projects with diverse dataset sizes encompassing 30,924 data instances. We compare two QML algorithms PQSVC (Pegasos QSVC) and QSVC against the classical support vector classifier (SVC). Our technique addresses large datasets in QSVC algorithms by dividing them into smaller subsets. We propose and evaluate an aggregation method to combine predictions from these models to detect the entire test dataset. We also introduce an incremental testing methodology to overcome the difficulties of quantum feature mapping during the testing approach. The study shows the effectiveness of QSVC and PQSVC in detecting buggy software commits. The aggregation technique successfully combines predictions from smaller data subsets, enhancing the overall detection accuracy for the entire test dataset. The incremental testing methodology effectively manages the challenges associated with quantum feature mapping during the testing process. We contribute to the advancement of QML algorithms in defect prediction, unveiling the potential for further research in this domain. The specific scenario of the short-term activity frame (STAF) highlights the early detection of buggy software commits during the initial developmental phases of software systems, particularly when dataset sizes remain insufficient to train machine learning models.},

However, the influence of different factors on the catalytic ozonation of VOCs, especially of multi-component VOCs, is still indeterminate. Herein, the effect of each reaction parameter on catalytic ozonation of single- and multi-component of toluene and dimethyl carbonate was systematically evaluated using a highly efficient catalyst (Mn/Y). Simultaneously, a multiple quadratic regression model was established by response surface methodology to compare the difference of the contribution of different reaction conditions to single- and multi-component VOCs reaction systems. It was found that the effect of different factors on VOCs conversion followed reaction temperature > space velocity > input concentration of ozone. In addition, the effect of the reaction conditions on ozone conversion in DMC reaction system and CO_x selectivity in toluene reaction system (reaction temperature > input concentration of ozone > space velocity) is different from the other reaction systems (reaction temperature > space velocity > input concentration of ozone). Satisfactorily, the results of the catalytic reaction experiment are highly consistent with the data fitted by the multiple quadratic regression model. It can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the reaction parameters of catalytic ozonation of VOCs in different reaction systems.},

  abstract     = {Building information modeling (BIM) demonstrates transformative potential in enhancing productivity within the architecture, engineering and construction industry. Nevertheless, determining how to improve the project performance through diverse BIM application conditions and identifying the performance improvement paths remains a valuable yet underexplored topic. Combined with the four actual application stages of BIM (the embryonic, the development, the stability, and the maturity stage) and five application conditions (BIM personnel training, BIM application points, BIM team building, BIM platform establishment, and BIM standard formulation), this study explores the performance improvement paths for Chinese BIM-supported civil engineering projects using the qualitative comparative analysis method. The findings indicate that none of the five application conditions constitutes a necessary condition for high project performance. The results reveal three configuration paths for enhancing comprehensive and individual performance: the talent-oriented path focusing on BIM personnel training and BIM team building, the technology-oriented path emphasizing BIM standard formulation, BIM platform establishment, and BIM application points, and the integrated path combining the talent-oriented path and the technology-oriented path. This paper not only can help the project stakeholders to allocate resources and improve performance for Chinese BIM-supported civil engineering projects but also provides a reference for government-related policies.},

  abstract     = {Objective The aim of this study was to develop and assess a radiomics model utilizing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the prediction of preoperative risk assessment in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Material and methods An analysis was performed retrospectively on a group of 121 patients who received a histological diagnosis of GIST. They were then divided into two sets, with 85 in the training set and 36 in the validation set through random partitioning. Radiomics features from five MRI sequences, totaling 600 per patient, were extracted and subjected to feature selection utilizing a random forest algorithm. The discriminatory efficacy of the models was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (P-R) curve analyses. Model calibration was assessed via calibration curves. Subgroup analysis was performed on GISTs with a pathological maximum diameter equal to or less than 5 cm. Furtherly, Kaplan–Meier (K-M) curves and log-rank tests were used to compare the differences in survival status among different groups. Cox regression analysis was employed to identify independent prognostic factors and to construct a prognostic prediction model. Results The clinical model (Model^C) displayed limited predictive efficacy in the context of GIST. Conversely, a radiomics model (Model^R) incorporating five parameters exhibited robust discriminative capabilities across both the training and validation sets, yielding area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.893 (95},

  abstract     = {Goal-oriented requirements engineering approaches aim to capture desired goals and strategies of relevant stakeholders during early requirements engineering stages, using goal models. Socio-technical systems (STSs) involve a rich interplay of human actors (traditional stakeholders, described as actors in goal models) and technical systems. Actors may depend on each other for goals to be achieved, activities to be performed, and resources to be supplied. These dependencies create new opportunities by extending actors’ capabilities but may make the actor vulnerable if the dependee fails to deliver the dependum (knowingly or unintentionally). This paper proposes a novel quantitative metric, called Actor Interaction Metric (AIM), to measure inter-actor dependencies in Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL) models. The metric is used to categorize inter-actor dependencies into positive (beneficial), negative (harmful), and neutral (no impact). Furthermore, the AIM metric is used to identify the most harmful/beneficial dependency for each actor. The proposed approach is implemented in a tool targeting the textual GRL language, part of the User Requirements Notation (URN) standard. We evaluate experimentally our approach using 13 GRL models, with positive results on applicability and scalability.},

However, existing embedded methods, particularly those based on regression, often assume a linear relationship between the feature and decision spaces, which is not suitable for complex and large-scale data. To overcome the limitation, the FDC model is proposed as a novel embedded feature selection approach grounded in granular computing theory. By incorporating a fuzzy consistency metric, the FDC model enables nonlinear mapping from the feature space to the decision space, capturing the intricate relationship between features and decisions. FDC integrates a dual mechanism of fusion fuzzy information decision learning and classification reward, allowing it to simultaneously account for both the fuzzy and explicit aspects of classification. Experimental evaluations on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that the FDC model effectively improves feature selection accuracy, suggesting its potential and applicability in practical settings.},

  abstract     = {Many different engineering models are used in the development of technical systems such as the electro-mechanical drive train. The goal of utilising these models is to predict the physical behaviour of the system by virtually testing it. Already existing engineering models have to be identified and reused, to increase the efficiency of the development process. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach motego [ 1 , 2 ] supports the development of mechanical systems in a holistic and function-oriented manner. The system solution and the solution element are core elements in motego, that realise specific functions. The solution element contains the principle solution and domain models (e.g. engineering models), while the system solution contains solution elements and domain models. The system solution and especially the solution element provides a meaningful structure for organising and reusing models. However, in literature those solution elements are not identified and structured yet. This is also true for the electro-mechanical drive train, which is used as case for this study. It is assumed the solution elements can be identified by analysing the interaction between active surfaces of parts in contact. This contribution proposes a classification procedure for solution elements, which is based on elementary functions and principle solutions as they are elements of established development methods. Viele unterschiedliche Engineering Modelle werden bei der Entwicklung technischer Systeme wie dem elektromechanischen Antriebsstrang verwendet.

In der Literatur sind diese Solution Elemente jedoch noch nicht identifiziert und strukturiert. Dies gilt auch für den elektromechanischen Antriebsstrang, der in dieser Publikation als Use Case verwendet wird. Es wird angenommen, dass die Solution Elemente durch die Analyse der Wechselwirkung von Wirkflächen als Teil des Kontaktes identifiziert werden können. Dieser Beitrag schlägt ein Klassifizierungsverfahren für Solution Elemente vor, das auf elementaren Funktionen und Prinziplösungen etablierter Entwicklungsmethoden basiert.},

Historically, the respective multi-level well-formedness schemes have either been overly restrictive or too lax. Orthogonal Ontological Classification has been proposed as a foundation that combines the selectivity of strict schemes with the flexibility afforded by laxer schemes. In this paper, we present a formalization of Orthogonal Ontological Classification, which we empirically validated to demonstrate some of its hitherto only postulated claims using an implementation in ConceptBase .

  abstract     = {The requirement for production systems to automatically determine their configuration is becoming more prominent. Self-configuration in manufacturing deals with the capability of a production system to configure itself in response to changes in its environment or product requirement. An understanding of the capabilities required to achieve self-configuration allows systems to be evaluated for their readiness to realise this goal. This enables users to identify where technologies can be used, where gaps may be present in existing system and where developments should be prioritised. This paper introduces a novel level-based classification system for assessing self-configuration capability in production systems. The classification is organised into stages, each representing a distinct level of self-configuration maturity, allowing for a stage-wise transition towards complete self-configuration. The enablers, key approaches, applications, and challenges to adoption of self-configuration in manufacturing systems are explored. A practical industrial use-case leak testing system is presented to demonstrate the application of the classification, showcasing how specific levels and features of self-configuration are mapped to real-world production settings. The outcomes of this application provide insights into the effectiveness and readiness of production systems for self-configuration, highlighting actionable areas for system improvement. Additionally, the paper discusses future research directions, including potential developments in data management, interoperability, and real-time adaptability, which are essential for advancing autonomous manufacturing systems.},

  abstract     = {Class incremental semantic segmentation aims to preserve old knowledge while learning new tasks, however, it is impeded by catastrophic forgetting and background shift issues. Prior works indicate the pivotal importance of initializing new classifiers and mainly focus on transferring knowledge from the background classifier or preparing classifiers for future classes, neglecting the flexibility and variance of new classifiers. In this paper, we propose a new classifier pre-tuning (NeST) method applied before the formal training process, learning a transformation from old classifiers to generate new classifiers for initialization rather than directly tuning the parameters of new classifiers. Our method can make new classifiers align with the backbone and adapt to the new data, preventing drastic changes in the feature extractor when learning new classes. Besides, we design a strategy considering the cross-task class similarity to initialize matrices used in the transformation, helping achieve the stability-plasticity trade-off. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets show that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the performance of previous methods.

In view of the present situation that the prediction accuracy of the unequal division shear zone model needs to be improved and there are a large number of uncertain parameters that need to be inversed, a method of sensitivity analysis and classification of the uncertain parameters of the model is proposed to reduce the number of parameters that need to be inversed, and the model is improved. Firstly, the Sobol method is used to analyze the global sensitivity of 10 uncertain parameters such as the shear zone thickness h , Taylor–Quinney coefficient μ and JC parameters of the unequal division shear zone model. According to the analysis results, they are divided into sensitive parameters and insensitive parameters. Then, the sensitive parameters are inversed by genetic algorithm using experimental data. Finally, the sensitive parameters are substituted into the unequal division shear zone model to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. When the workpiece material is Al 6061-T6 and 42CrMo4 steel, the uncertain parameters that need to be inversed determined by this method are reduced from 10 to 4 and 3, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the problem of estimating the state of a class of polynomial systems with sporadically available measurements and external disturbance. To begin with, an observer with sporadically available measurements is designed to estimate the states of the polynomial system. We introduce a timer variable to initiate the arrival of new measurements and examine the whole system in a hybrid systems framework. Then, we establish conditions for exponential stability of the polynomial system by employing the observer. Additionally, the designed observer ensures the exponential input-to-state stability for the hybrid error system in the presence of external disturbances. Finally, we provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity of the designed observer in estimating the states of the polynomial system and guaranteeing input-to-state stability under external disturbance.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we have proposed and tested a double exponential Morse (DEM) potential energy function (PEF) which describes the interatomic interactions of diatomic molecules. The DEM PEF, composed of the remedy function to the Morse PEF, is used to describe the vibrational motion for the ground electronic states of Br_2 and Cl_2 molecules. Comparing the Morse and DEM potential energy functions (PEFs), only three experimental spectral constants like 
$$D_{e} ,\;\omega_{e} ,\;{\text{and}}\;r_{e}$$
 D e , ω e , and r e for both cases are needed to be taken into account. Furthermore, the potential energy curves (PECs) and the vibrational energy levels for the ground electronic states of Br_2 and Cl_2 molecules are calculated by the DEM potential, Hulburt–Hirschfelder (HH) potential, Morse potential, improved multiparameter exponential-type (IMPET) potential and Huxley–Murrell (HM) potential. The results reveal that the DEM potential fits the Rydberg–Klein–Rees (RKR) data much better against other potentials, especially in the medium-long range regions. The vibrational energy levels derived from the DEM PEF align more closely with the experimental data. Moreover, the DEM potential provides opportunities for theoretical calculations of reduced molar Gibbs free energy and the molar entropy in a temperature range of 100–6000 K.

However, studies investigating the impacts of such accidents have primarily focused on single-route exposures, potentially underestimating the extent of damage. This study aimed to conduct an aggregate risk assessment for multi-route exposure to hazardous chemicals to ensure systematic and rational management of the health impacts on residents exposed to chemical accidents, considering the behavior of a hazardous chemical from a chemical accident within environmental media. Drawing upon a real chemical accident that occurred in Siheung, Gyeonggi-do, in 2019, leakage of 500 L of toluene over an hour was assumed. Employing a multimedia environmental dynamics model, the time-dependent concentrations across various environmental media were calculated, and the average daily dose (ADD), hazard quotient (HQ), and hazard index (HI) for each exposure route included in the multi-route exposure assessment were derived. Health risks were deemed present if the calculated HQ and HI values exceeded the threshold of 1. The results indicated the highest ADD values among the 0–9 age group, with inhalation exposure registering the highest ADD across all exposure routes. However, no significant health risks were observed, with both HQ and HI values not exceeding 1. This aggregate risk assessment approach is proposed as an effective preliminary evaluation method for health impact assessments in areas affected by chemical accidents. Graphical Abstract},

The interpolation quadrature rule is used to approximate the memory terms, and the spatial discretization is performed using the compact difference method. Stability and convergence of the scheme are rigorously proved and substantiated by numerical experiments.},

Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) is a widely used model for capturing nonlinear dynamics and interactions between multiple exposures and health outcomes. However, tools for quantifying the interactions captured by this flexible model are scarce. Utilizing the inherent connection between BKMR and Gaussian process regressions, we adopt the classic variance-based sensitivity analysis tools from the uncertainty quantification community and propose a variable clustering approach to quantify interactions, discover high-order interaction terms, and rank variable importance. The performance of this method is demonstrated in a range of simulation scenarios and applied to a real dataset to examine the interactive effects of multiple per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposures, dietary patterns, and gestational diabetes mellitus status on thyroid function in women during their late pregnancy.},

However, limited studies have focused on adjusted effect of multi-pollutant exposures on public health. This study aimed to examine short-term effects of three common air pollutants—ground-level ozone (ozone), nitrogen dioxide (NO_2), and fine particulate matter (PM_2.5)—through multi-pollutant models for mixed effect of adjustment. Daily data (circulatory hospitalization and mortality) and hourly data (air pollutants and temperature) were collected for 24 Canadian cities for 2001–2012. We applied generalized additive over-dispersion Poisson regression models with 1, 2, or 3 pollutants for city-specific risks, and Bayesian hierarchical models for national risks. This study found little mixed effect of adjustment through multi-pollutant models (ozone and/or NO_2 and/or PM_2.5) for circulatory hospitalization or mortality in Canada for 2001–2012, indicating that the 1-pollutant model did not result in considerable under- or over-estimates. It seemed weak-to-moderate correlations among air pollutants did not change the significant effect of one air pollutant after accounting for others. Inconsistent findings between other previous studies and this study indicate the need of comparable study design for multi-pollutant effect analysis.},

Individuals rely on others’ expertise to achieve a basic understanding of the world. But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A = 737; 1B = 734; 1C = 733; 2A = 1,014; 2B = 509; 2C = 1,012; 3A = 1,026; 3B = 512; 4 = 421), we address this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. We identify ‘when’ and ‘why’ the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. We find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. We also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.},

In this paper, we will apply LIME for decision explanation of AI_Polypharmacy models. LIME will rely on perturbing patient data to generate new individuals similar to the one for which the diagnosis is made. We outline the challenges we face in this study of LIME applied to polypharmacy: the size of our dataset, which is very large; the specificity of the data, where all features are binary and unbalanced; and the mismatch of LIME with these pharmacy data. We address these challenges by first identifying the LIME limitations we face, and then proposing an effective strategy for using the synthetic pharmacy data to form an information-rich dataset for building locality in LIME. To do this, we formulate the problem as a two-step data balancing exercise so that fidelity in LIME can be ensured on our data and on our polypharmacy AI model. The challenge in this step is how to balance a massive, highly unbalanced database while respecting the constraints and goals of the polypharmacy domain that LIME will use to generate valid explanations. In addition, we choose an appropriate similarity distance for patient records to handle both the imbalance of our data and its binary categorical nature. The results of this experiment show that the proposed approach applied to massive, unbalanced binary data such as those in our domain, and overcomes the fidelity problem of LIME. As a result, it was able to generate valid explanations in the context of polypharmacy.},

  abstract     = {The philosophical study of computer simulations has been largely subordinated to the analysis of sets of equations and their implementation on the computer. What has received less attention, however, is whether simulation models can be taken as units of analysis in their own right. Here I present my own experimental work investigating this issue. This article explores the capacity of programming languages to represent target systems and submits that, in a number of cases, the representation of simulation models differs in non-trivial ways from sets of equations. If my claim is correct, then a few important methodological and epistemological concerns emerge that need our attention. This article finishes by briefly addressing some implications for the philosophy of computer simulation.},

  abstract     = {Context Ensuring safety for any sophisticated system is getting more complex due to the rising number of features and functionalities. This calls for formal methods to entrust confidence in such systems. Nevertheless, using formal methods in industry is demanding because of their lack of usability and the difficulty of understanding verification results. Objective We evaluate the acceptance of formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers, particularly whether the difficulty of understanding verification results can be reduced. Method We perform two different exploratory studies. First, we conduct a user survey to explore challenges in identifying inconsistent specifications and using formal methods by Bosch automotive engineers. Second, we perform a one-group pretest-posttest experiment to collect impressions from Bosch engineers familiar with formal methods to evaluate whether understanding verification results is simplified by our counterexample explanation approach. Results The results from the user survey indicate that identifying refinement inconsistencies, understanding formal notations, and interpreting verification results are challenging. Nevertheless, engineers are still interested in using formal methods in real-world development processes because it could reduce the manual effort for verification. Additionally, they also believe formal methods could make the system safer. Furthermore, the one-group pretest-posttest experiment results indicate that engineers are more comfortable understanding the counterexample explanation than the raw model checker output. Limitations The main limitation of this study is the generalizability beyond the target group of Bosch automotive engineers.},

  abstract     = {Background A huge amount of research is carried out nowadays in Artificial Intelligence to propose automated ways to analyse medical data with the aim to support doctors in delivering medical diagnoses. However, a main issue of these approaches is the lack of transparency and interpretability of the achieved results, making it hard to employ such methods for educational purposes. It is therefore necessary to develop new frameworks to enhance explainability in these solutions. Results In this paper, we present a novel full pipeline to generate automatically natural language explanations for medical diagnoses. The proposed solution starts from a clinical case description associated with a list of correct and incorrect diagnoses and, through the extraction of the relevant symptoms and findings, enriches the information contained in the description with verified medical knowledge from an ontology. Finally, the system returns a pattern-based explanation in natural language which elucidates why the correct (incorrect) diagnosis is the correct (incorrect) one. The main contribution of the paper is twofold: first, we propose two novel linguistic resources for the medical domain (i.e, a dataset of 314 clinical cases annotated with the medical entities from UMLS, and a database of biological boundaries for common findings), and second, a full Information Extraction pipeline to extract symptoms and findings from the clinical cases and match them with the terms in a medical ontology and to the biological boundaries. An extensive evaluation of the proposed approach shows the our method outperforms comparable approaches. Conclusions Our goal is to offer AI-assisted educational support framework to form clinical residents to formulate sound and exhaustive explanations for their diagnoses to patients.},

We present the GLEAN model that encodes an extensible Finite State Machine (FSM) executional semantics for modular TNM. Extensibility is provided in terms of a high-level formalism for defining execution semantics of custom TNM constructs. GLEAN is implemented using the Notation3 Semantic Web language, which provides powerful features for decisional criteria and queries, and offers integration with the HL7 FHIR standard. We explain CIG workflows as visual, intuitive workflow diagrams that are guided by a concrete patient profile at runtime. As a use case, we computerized guidelines on lipid management for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a challenging problem for many Primary Care Providers (PCPs). To educate PCP on lipid management for CKD, we leverage GLEAN’s easy modularization of CIG and CIG explanations as visual runtime workflows.},

  abstract     = {Context Historically, large-scale outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle were initiated mainly by windthrows. However, after 2018, a severe drought triggered the hitherto largest bark beetle outbreak observed in Europe, signalling a major shift in the disturbance regime. Objectives Develop and test an approach that allows simulating this novel disturbance dynamics and evaluate landscape-scale compound impacts of wind- and drought-initiated outbreaks throughout the twenty-first century. Methods We incorporated drought-initiated outbreaks into the forest landscape simulation model iLand, using critical values of vapour pressure deficit as the outbreak trigger. Forest management records and remote sensing-based disturbance maps were used to derive model parameters and evaluate simulated dynamics in a Central European forest landscape (41,000 hectares). The period 1961–2021 was used for model evaluation, and the years until 2100 for scenario analysis. Results I ncorporating drought as outbreak trigger led to a notable decoupling of wind and bark beetle disturbances, which have historically formed a typical disturbance cascade in European forests. While forest growing stock and species composition were resilient to a wind-dominated disturbance regime, this resilience diminished under the compounded impact of wind- and drought-triggered disturbances. The new disturbance regime caused a persistent decline in Norway spruce and resulted in an overall decrease in landscape-level growing stock. Conclusions Our findings underscore the urgent need for new approaches to evaluate increasingly complex disturbance dynamics and suggest that the future impacts of bark beetles on forest landscapes may be greater than previously anticipated.},

However, the standard self-attention in the Transformer makes it difficult to model local features of images effectively. To alleviate the above problem, this paper proposes a high-quality deraining Transformer with e ffective l arge k ernel a ttention, named as ELKAformer. The network employs the Transformer-Style Effective Large Kernel Conv-Block (ELKB), which contains 3 key designs: Large Kernel Attention Block (LKAB), Dynamical Enhancement Feed-forward Network (DEFN), and Edge Squeeze Recovery Block (ESRB) to guide the extraction of rich features. To be specific, LKAB introduces convolutional modulation to substitute vanilla self-attention and achieve better local representations. The designed DEFN refines the most valuable attention values in LKAB, allowing the overall design to better preserve pixel-wise information. Additionally, we develop ESRB to obtain long-range dependencies of different positional information. Massive experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves favorable effects while effectively saving computational costs. Our code is available at github},

Furthermore, tailored consensus adjustment methods are proposed for each region based on social contagion theory to facilitate consensus achievement.

  abstract     = {Mapping near-field pollutant concentration is essential to track plume dispersion in urban areas. By solving most of the turbulence spectrum, large-eddy simulations (LES) can accurately represent concentration spatial variability. Synthesizing this large amount of information to improve the accuracy of lower-fidelity operational models is particularly appealing. Due to the computational cost of LES, it becomes a challenge in multi-query contexts, to quantify how tracer dispersion changes with atmospheric and source parametric variations. We propose a data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) combining proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and probabilistic Gaussian process regression (GPR) to efficiently predict tracer concentration field first- and second-order statistics. The novelty of this work lies in the original approach used to efficiently tune the GPR based on the available reduced-basis information and properties. In practice, the GPR hyperparameters are optimized through the hierarchy of POD modes thanks to Bayesian optimization informed by POD. The robustness of the approach is also addressed under small data constraint. A detailed analysis of our model performance is carried out in the case of a turbulent atmospheric boundary-layer flow over a surface-mounted obstacle for which the convective character of the system together with the uncertainty of the pollutant source location make it very challenging for ROM. The model is able to capture the wide range of spatial scales across the POD modes. The ROM accuracy remains acceptable for a minimal budget of about one hundred LES snapshots, providing a first estimation moving towards more realistic atmospheric dispersion applications.},

  abstract     = {Multi-run numerical simulations using supercomputers are increasingly used by physicists and engineers for dealing with input data and model uncertainties. Most of the time, the input parameters of a simulation are modeled as random variables, then simulations are run a (possibly large) number of times with input parameters varied according to a specific design of experiments. Uncertainty quantification for numerical simulations is a hard computational problem, currently bounded by the large size of the produced results. This book chapter is about using in situ techniques to enable large scale uncertainty quantification studies. We provide a comprehensive description of Melissa, a file avoiding, adaptive, fault-tolerant, and elastic framework that computes in transit statistical quantities of interest. Melissa currently implements the on-the-fly computation of the statistics necessary for the realization of large scale uncertainty quantification studies: moment-based statistics (mean, standard deviation, higher orders), quantiles, Sobol’ indices, and threshold exceedance.},

  abstract     = {Industrial control applications are usually designed by domain experts instead of software engineers. These experts frequently use visual programming languages based on standards such as IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499. The standards apply model-based engineering concepts to abstract from hardware and low-level communication. Developing industrial control software is challenging due to the fact that control systems are usually unique and need to be maintained for many years. The arising challenges, together with the growing complexity of control software, require very usable model-based development environments for visual programming languages. However, so far only little empirical research exists on the practical usefulness of such environments, i.e., their usability and utility. In this paper, we discuss common control software maintenance tasks and tool capabilities based on existing research and show the realization of these capabilities in the 4diac IDE. We performed a walkthrough of the demonstrated capabilities using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework from the field of human–computer interaction. We then improved the tool and conducted a user study involving ten industrial automation engineers, who used the 4diac IDE in a realistic control software maintenance scenario. Based on lessons learnt from this study, we adapted the 4diac IDE to better handle large graphical models. We evaluated these changes in a reassessment study with automation engineers from seven industrial enterprises. We derive general implications with respect to large-scale applications for developers of IDEs that we deem applicable in the context of (visual) model-based engineering tools.},

  abstract     = {Mobile health, which is not limited by time and space, can effectively alleviate the imbalance of medical resources. Currently, more and more hospitals begin to pay attention to online medical care and actively expand their mobile channels. Among of which, the cooperation with the third-party platform is an effective way to expand the online services of most hospitals. With the increasing number of mobile health applications (mHealth apps), it is difficult to select the ideal application. Most of the existing studies on mHealth app selection are conducted from the perspective of users who have health needs, which is insufficient. The views of multiple stakeholders should be taken into account. mHealth app selection can be regarded as a large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) problem. In this paper, a hybrid LSGDM method is proposed to select the mHealth app with the highest user satisfaction. First, the weights of criteria are obtained based on quality function deployment and 2-additive measure. Furthermore, a consensus model that considers cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors of decision makers is applied to select the ideal mHealth app. Finally, an illustrative example is implemented to exhibit the utility and validity of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In order to realize CNC incremental forming of unequal height sheet metal parts with large forming angles on both sides of the sheet metal part, a three-stage incremental forming method is proposed. In this method, the sheet metal parts are inclined to the required angle during the forming process, and in order to ensure reasonable material flow during the forming process, the forming toolpath adopts the inclined forming toolpath, the contour line forming toolpath, and the equal interval parallel downward forming toolpath, and the algorithms for constructing the forming model and forming toolpath for each stage are also given. The case studies of the algorithm show that the proposed algorithms can generate the required forming model and forming toolpath. And three different forming methods of numerical simulation and forming experiments had been conducted; the results show that the forming method proposed in this paper is compared to the traditional two-stage and three-stage forming methods, the minimum thickness is large about 0.119 mm and 0.125 mm, the difference between the thickness is reduced by about 0.101 mm and 0.114 mm, the average profile deviation is reduced by 0.077 mm and 0.131 mm, and no bulging phenomenon occurs, which indicates that the profile dimensional accuracy of the sheet metal parts obtained by the forming method proposed in this paper is better, the minimum thickness is larger and uniformly distributed, and the forming quality is better.},

Climatic unpredictability and rising temperatures cause soil water depletion, leading to unpredictable downstream runoff. This study examines the consequences of climate change on hydrological regimes and their effect on hydropower production in Khimti River basin of Nepal. This study used the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) in the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5) emission scenarios of three climate models (CanESM5, MIROC6, and MRI-ESM2-0) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The study encompassed recorded temperature and rainfall data to correct errors. River discharge data were utilized for calibration and validation the SWAT model, leveraging 21 hydrological parameters. The result revealed that the projected stream flow is higher than the observed flow in all seasons except CanESM5 for the monsoon season from 2023 to 2074.

  abstract     = {Nanomaterials have revolutionized the battery industry by enhancing energy storage capacities and charging speeds, and their application in hydrogen (H_2) storage likewise holds strong potential, though with distinct challenges and mechanisms. H_2 is a crucial future zero-carbon energy vector given its high gravimetric energy density, which far exceeds that of liquid hydrocarbons. However, its low volumetric energy density in gaseous form currently requires storage under high pressure or at low temperature. This review critically examines the current and prospective landscapes of solid-state H_2 storage technologies, with a focus on pragmatic integration of advanced materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), magnesium-based hybrids, and novel sorbents into future energy networks. These materials, enhanced by nanotechnology, could significantly improve the efficiency and capacity of H_2 storage systems by optimizing H_2 adsorption at the nanoscale and improving the kinetics of H_2 uptake and release. We discuss various H_2 storage mechanisms—physisorption, chemisorption, and the Kubas interaction—analyzing their impact on the energy efficiency and scalability of storage solutions. The review also addresses the potential of “smart MOFs”, single-atom catalyst-doped metal hydrides, MXenes and entropy-driven alloys to enhance the performance and broaden the application range of H_2 storage systems, stressing the need for innovative materials and system integration to satisfy future energy demands. High-throughput screening, combined with machine learning algorithms, is noted as a promising approach to identify patterns and predict the behavior of novel materials under various conditions, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with experimental trials. In closing, we discuss the increasing involvement of various companies in solid-state H_2 storage, particularly in prototype vehicles, from a techno-economic perspective. This forward-looking perspective underscores the necessity for ongoing material innovation and system optimization to meet the stringent energy demands and ambitious sustainability targets increasingly in demand.},

Hydrodynamic performance of an AUV and especially it’s hull resistance is an important factor in determining the power requirements and design hull shape for the AUV. This topic presents a procedure using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) for determining hydrodynamic performance and hull resistance of the AUV with a different hull shape. The three different hull shapes are proposed to estimate hydrodynamic performance and hull resistance by using the CFD. From the results of analysis hydrodynamic performance of the AUV as well as pressure, velocity distribution around hull and resistance hull shape of the AUV, the detailed has been clearly.},

  abstract     = {Ocean wave breaking is a difficult-to-model oceanographic process, which has implications for extreme wave statistics, the dissipation of wave energy, and air–sea interaction. Numerical methods capable of reliably simulating real-world directionally spread breaking waves are useful for investigating the physics of wave breaking and for the design of offshore structures and floating bodies. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics is capable of modelling highly steep and overturning free surfaces, which makes it a promising method for simulating breaking waves. This paper investigates the effect of smoothing length on simulated wave breaking in both following and crossing seas. To do so, we reproduce numerically the experiments of highly directionally spread breaking waves in McAllister et al. (J Fluid Mech 860:767–786, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.886 ) using a range of normalised smoothing lengths: 
$$h/d_p=1.4$$
 h / d p = 1.4 , 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, with h smoothing length and 
$$d_p$$
 d p particle spacing. The smallest smoothing length we use appears to adversely affect the fidelity of the simulated surface elevation, so that the tallest wave crest observed in experiments is not fully reproduced (coefficient of determination 
$$r^2\approx 0.7$$
 r 2 ≈ 0.7 ). For smoothing lengths 
$$h/d_p=1.7$$
 h / d p = 1.7 , 2.0, and 2.3, the experiments are well reproduced ( 
$$r^2\ge 0.88$$
 r 2 ≥ 0.88 ); in these simulations smoothing length predominantly affects the spatial extent and duration of breaking. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of our simulations shows that values of 
$$h/d_p$$
 h / d p in the range 
$$1.7{-}2$$
 1.7 - 2 best reproduce the wave breaking phenomena observed in experiments.},

  abstract     = {In vitro screening for pharmacological activity of existing drugs showed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Oral administration of these compounds to obtain desired pulmonary exposures resulted in dose-limiting systemic toxicity in humans. However, pulmonary drug delivery enables direct and rapid administration to obtain higher local tissue concentrations in target tissue. In this work, inhalable formulations for thermal aerosolization of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed, and their physicochemical properties were characterized. Thermal aerosolization of 40 mg/mL chloroquine and 100 mg/mL hydroxychloroquine formulations delivered respirable aerosol particle sizes with 0.15 and 0.33 mg per 55 mL puff, respectively. In vitro toxicity was evaluated by exposing primary human bronchial epithelial cells to aerosol generated from Vitrocell. An in vitro exposure to 7.24 μg of chloroquine or 7.99 μg hydroxychloroquine showed no significant changes in cilia beating, transepithelial electrical resistance, and cell viability. The pharmacokinetics of inhaled aerosols was predicted by developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model that included a detailed species-specific respiratory tract physiology and lysosomal trapping. Based on the model predictions, inhaling emitted doses comprising 1.5 mg of chloroquine or 3.3 mg hydroxychloroquine three times a day may yield therapeutically effective concentrations in the lung. Inhalation of higher doses further increased effective concentrations in the lung while maintaining lower systemic concentrations. Given the theoretically favorable risk/benefit ratio, the clinical significance for pulmonary delivery of aerosolized chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 needs to be established in rigorous safety and efficacy studies.

Gross primary production is the basis of global carbon uptake. Gross primary production losses are often related to hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and heatwaves, but the trend of such losses driven by hydroclimatic extremes remains unclear. Using observationally-constrained and process-based model data from 1982-2016, we show that drought-heat events, drought-cold events, droughts and heatwaves are the dominant drivers of gross primary production loss.

Based on the climate model performance evaluation result RACMO2.2T model performed best in the basin and the outputs from this model were used as input data for the successfully validated HBV model to assess climate change impacts. The Mann Kendell trend test result shows an increasing trend in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and potential evapotranspiration but the test result does not show any trend in precipitation. The climate projection result shows streamflow will decrease in the mid-future due to a significant decrease in precipitation and an increase of potential evapotranspiration in the basin.

  abstract     = {Abstract Quantitative and qualitative knowledge about the potential impacts of climate change on extreme hydrological events is crucial for water resource management and extreme risk management under climate change. This has theoretical and realistic implications to study and couple the climate system with hydrologic processes, to understand the system and solve related problems in water resources and extreme hydrology, such as decision making, plan management, environmental protection, and ecological balance. This paper reviews recent studies investigating climate change impact on hydrological extremes using a perspective of the integrated modeling framework comprising climate change scenarios, climate models, bias correction methods, hydrological modeling (model structure and parameterization), and reducible uncertainty arising from these sources characterized by a paucity of knowledge. The available research outcomes show the extreme high flows are likely to increase under climate change in the most parts of Europe, Asia, and the USA, but greatly vary and decrease in Africa and Latin America, which is highly variable and uncertain in space and time. Each component in integrated modeling has an important role in shifting and producing uncertainty in projected extreme flow. Among them, the climate model’s discrepancy and hydrological models’ structure are the more dominant source of uncertainty in projection of extreme high and low (or mean) flow in most of the regions, respectively. However, the quality of input data and hydrological model structures are the most dominant source of uncertainty in Africa, Latin America, and some parts of Asia. This indicated that these regions have strong hydrological cycle and higher physiographic heterogeneity. We believe that our existing knowledge and skills need to be improved and transformed into an accurate mathematical and physical representation, to minimize the uncertainty due to the effect of choices in the methodology chain. So, disentangling the aggregated uncertainty in the cascade modeling chain can be done by using variances, which can help understand the interaction effect and identify their contribution to the projected extreme flow. This comprehensive review can help modelers to identify and reduce uncertainty in projecting hydrological extremes and policy makers for full awareness of the various uncertainties to make a robust decision for water resources management under climate change. This study provides a comprehensive review on reducing uncertainty in projecting hydrological extremes from the perspective of an integrated modeling framework Existing knowledge and skills need to be improved and transformed into an accurate mathematical representation The impact of climate change on hydrological extremes is highly variable and uncertain in space and time Uncertainties of the integrated modeling framework can be reduced by decomposing the aggregated uncertainty using variance analysis and/or the modeling chain},

  abstract     = {Abstract Upper shoreface depositional systems (USE) have accumulations of coarse-grained sedimentary facies of lowstand systems tract (LST), which are encased inside the low-porosity and compacted shales of transgressive system tract (TST). Hence, they globally form stratigraphic trapping petroleum systems. These sandstones of the low-standing system tract (LST) are covered inside a suite of the non-porous and compacted shales of transgressive system tract (TST), and they develop stratigraphic systems. The full spectrum-constrained attributes create hurdles in predicting parasequence sets, hydrocarbon-bearing bright spots, densities, and thicknesses of this USE. There are a variety of seismic attributes, such as the trace envelops relative impedances, and the types of spectral decomposition, such as the forward Fourier transformations and the discrete Fourier transformations. However, the drawback of these remaining tools, except the wavelet-based transformations of non-stationary seismic signals from time-domain to frequency-domains transformations, is the unique attribute tool of seismic data imaging, which has the finest properties to image the sub-surface depositional systems at their accurate sub-surface locations at the highest seismic data resolutions. Therefore, this study utilises the spectrum decomposition-based volumes and the instantaneous spectral decomposition-based velocity and density reservoir simulations (ISVDR) and instantaneous pseudo-gas-saturation [Sg] and pseudo-porosity [Py] [},

  abstract     = {Incised valley sandfills are globally renowned for forming excellent stratigraphic traps. These incised valleys are developed during the extensively falling stage of the sea, followed by a negligible rise, which fills the incised valleys with coarse-grained reservoir facies. However, sea-level fluctuations cause fluctuations in the lateral distribution of the reservoir. Hence, it becomes very difficult to simulate the exact thickness, impedances, and lateral phase changes. Hence, these might act as direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI). Therefore, this study applies the state-of-the-art spectral decomposition and static acoustic impedance reservoir simulations tool to determine the thin-bedded reservoirs within a stratigraphically complex unit for implicating the future well drilling strategies for the known gas field of Indus Onshore, Pakistan. The key emphasis was given to the selection and optimizations of the spectral waveform-based simulations. The outcomes of these simulations were to develop strategies for horizontal well drillings. The stratigraphic traps are NNW-SSE oriented with localized transpressional fault-controlled components. These fault-controlled components have played a vital role in the upward migration of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir facies. The 21-Hz, 29-Hz, and 41-Hz tuning blocks outline the hydrocarbon-bearing sand-filled reservoir facies inside the Lowstands system tract (LST). The 57-Hz tuning block recognizes the transgressive seal facies at the top of the LST. The bandlimited static reservoir model (SRM) shows some noise events within the sedimentary reflections. The 21-Hz spectral wavelet-based developed SRM has enhanced the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for imaging a 34 m thick sand-filled lens. Consequently, this study serves as an analog for global shallow-marine incised valley systems.},

Rapid tissue regeneration upon injury is important for the reinstatement of barrier integrity and its dysregulation promotes malignant transformation. Here we show that AHR is important for the termination of the regenerative response and the reacquisition of mature epithelial cell identity post injury in vivo and in organoid cultures in vitro. Using an integrative multi-omics approach in colon organoids, we show that AHR is required for timely termination of the regenerative response through direct regulation of transcription factors involved in epithelial cell differentiation as well as restriction of chromatin accessibility to regeneration-associated Yap/Tead transcriptional targets. Safeguarding a regulated regenerative response places AHR at a pivotal position in the delicate balance between controlled regeneration and malignant transformation. Rapid intestinal regeneration after injury is critical to maintain barrier integrity and homeostasis, but must be tightly controlled to prevent tumorigenesis. Here they show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is required to terminate the regenerative response after wound healing.},

In this study, four climate gridded precipitation products were utilized, namely Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim/land, the Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP). The key novelty of this study is to fill the gap in one of important areas of the transcontinental region of Eurasia, namely Rize province in the Black Sea region being selected as a study area since it has complex topography and climatology in addition to a limited number of gauging stations. A set of precipitation products were assessed for performance with the observed precipitation data before using a hydrological model (SWAT) to evaluate the basin response for the climate products. Three methods were considered in this study: (i) spatial comparison and (ii) hydrological and (iii) statistical evaluations. Along with precipitation forcing, the SWAT model simulations were analyzed in conjunction with streamflow observations. In an overall evaluation, the percentage bias of ERA-Interim/land, CFSR, APHRODITE, and MSWEP mean monthly precipitation is 19.9},

  abstract     = {Evaluating remote sensing techniques (RST)-based water quality monitoring systems in hydrological applications is a complex multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem due to several integrated issues. These issues include the need to consider 15 evaluation criteria, the importance of these criteria in relation to their application and network infrastructure, data variation, and trade-offs and conflicts between them. Therefore, this study proposes an MADM integrated modelling approach to weight these criteria and rank the selected RSTs using the “Fuzzy Weighted with Zero Inconsistency” (FWZIC) method coupled with the “ Vlse-kriterijumska Optimizcija I Kaompromisno Resenje ” (VIKOR) method. First, a decision matrix was developed for the evaluation criteria and their intersection with various RSTs in different network categories. Next, the assessment criteria were weighted using FWZIC, followed by ranking the RSTs for each category using VIKOR. The findings reveal that the criteria weighting varied across categories, as assigned by specialists-based FWZIC. For example, the “data acquisition system complexity” criterion received the maximum weight ( w  = 0.081) for mesh-based sensing and the lowest ( w  = 0.057) for cellular-based sensing. Using the obtained weights and based on the ascending order of the performance score value ( Q ), various RSTs were benchmarked using VIKOR. This includes ( n  = 22) RSTs in fixed star, ( n  = 8) RSTs in mesh sensing, ( n  = 6) RSTs in cellular sensing, ( n  = 3) RSTs in fixed cable sensing, and ( n  = 2) RSTs in movable sensing. Finally, the evaluation process for the benchmarked RSTs involved systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis, and comparison analysis, which confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach across all RST categories.},

  abstract     = {Arid area is very sensitive to global warming and are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, the water resources system in the arid area is fragile and will undergo tremendous changes with climate change. Therefore, the interaction of climate and hydrology in arid area has an important impact on the formation of regional microclimate and hydrological changes. Daihai Lake is a typical closed inland lake in arid area of China, and a key area for ecological protection in North China. In this paper, WRF-Hydro model is used to simulate the climate hydrological coupling situation of Daihai Basin from 1980 to 2020, and the coupling results are verified and calibrated by meteorological statistics, runoff calculation and remote sensing analysis. Based on the synopsis of climate and hydrology in the past 40 years, the causes and future trends of the hydrological elements in Daihai Basin are analyzed. Through the analysis, it is found that the interannual variation of precipitation in Daihai Basin is sharp, with 401.75 mm as the average from 1980 to 1994; and drastic fluctuations from 1995 to 2011, with a difference of nearly 400 mm between the interannual maximum and minimum; From 2012 to 2020, the fluctuation is small. Although the interannual variation of evaporation fluctuated, it showed an upward trend with a slope of 8.855 mm/year. The annual average temperature showed an obvious upward trend with a slope of 0.040 °C/year. From 1980 to 2020, the inflow of Daihai Lake shows a downward trend; Since 2013, the runoff into the lake has tended to be flat. Climate change and human activities are the decisive factors leading to the change of water quantity in Daihai, among which human activities play a greater role. Cultivated land irrigation and industrial water use are highly correlated with the lake discharge, and these two factors have a great influence on the lake discharge. If the current agricultural and industrial water consumption does not increase, Daihai still has a lifespan of nearly 120 years. If human activities do not change and any protective measures are not taken in time, under the background of global climate change, the flow of the Daihai Lake into the lake will be reduced to zero in 2025, and the Daihai Lake will completely dry up in 2031–2033. The study of climate hydrological coupling of long time series in Daihai Basin can not only make up for the lack of runoff data, but also provide the basis for water resources management, disaster prevention and mitigation.},

  abstract     = {To verify the applicability of the WRF/WRF-Hydro land surface parameterization scheme in the meteorological and hydrological simulation of the Upper and Middle Yalong River Basin, this paper adopts the WRF/WRF-Hydro coupling approach. Based on the albedo of the snow surface layer, the temporal change of snow/soil temperature, and the change of the soil impedance of evaporation/sublimation, eight groups of land surface parameterization combination schemes are constructed. Simulation studies on the rainfall-runoff period in 2012 are conducted to further analyze the effects of various land surface process parameterization schemes. The results show that: (1) The cumulative rainfall of each scheme under WRF simulation deviates negatively from the observed values, and the overall difference is not significant, but spatially various schemes show different distributions of storm centres; (2) The best rainfall-runoff simulation can be obtained when the albedo of the snow surface layer, the temporal change of snow/soil temperature, and the soil impedance of evaporation/sublimation are set as BATS, RSURF, and SLAB, respectively; (3) The optimal result for rainfall-runoff simulation are achieved when the temporal change of snow/soil temperature is set as BATS, RSURF, and SLAB.; (4) The use of PCI as a soil impedance parameter for evaporation/sublimation introduces significant cumulative rainfall fluctuations, potentially leading to poorer flow simulation. Therefore, it should be avoided as a choice in coupled simulation.},

  abstract     = {The Tianshan Mountains of Central Asia, highly sensitive to climate change, has been comprehensively assessed for its ecosystem vulnerability across multiple aspects. However, studies on the region’s main river systems and hydropower resources remain limited. Thus, examining the impact of climate change on the runoff and gross hydropower potential (GHP) of this region is essential for promoting sustainable development and effective management of water and hydropower resources. This study focused on the Kaidu River Basin that is situated above the Dashankou Hydropower Station on the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, China. By utilizing an ensemble of bias-corrected global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model coupled with a glacier module (VIC–Glacier), we examined the variations in future runoff and GHP during 2017–2070 under four shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) compared to the baseline period (1985–2016). The findings indicated that precipitation and temperature in the Kaidu River Basin exhibit a general upward trend under the four SSP scenarios, with the fastest rate of increase in precipitation under the SSP2-4.5 scenario and the most significant changes in mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, compared to the baseline period (1980–2016). Future runoff in the basin is projected to decrease, with rates of decline under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios being 3.09, 3.42, 7.04, and 7.20 m^3/s per decade, respectively. The trends in GHP are consistent with runoff, with rates of decline in GHP under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios at 507.74, 563.33, 1158.44, and 1184.52 MW/10a, respectively. Compared to the baseline period (1985–2016), the rates of change in GHP under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are −20.66},

  abstract     = {Food processing, a longstanding practice, employs a range of technologies to regulate microbial populations and ensure consistent quality and safety of products, instilling consumer trust in the food industry. As contemporary demands and safety standards evolve, a pressing need arises for less processed, nutrient-rich food items that adhere to more stringent microbiological criteria, promoting innovative and sustainable processing methods. Among these, hydrodynamic cavitation is presented as a promising technology due to its energy efficiency, low thermal impact, and ability to significantly reduce microbial loads without compromising nutritional value. Recent studies have explored hydrodynamic cavitation application in liquid food sterilization, beverage preservation, and water decontamination, demonstrating notable reductions in both spoilage and microorganisms. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this microbial inactivation ability of hydrodynamic cavitation remain partially understood, posing a challenge to process optimization and broader industrial adoption. This review critically examines the current understanding of hydrodynamic cavitation antimicrobial action, explores key design and operational parameters, and identifies knowledge gaps. Future research directions are proposed to enhance treatment efficacy and to support the integration of hydrodynamic cavitation into scalable, sustainable food processing workflows.},

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), networks reconstructed based on the genomic and metabolic information of one or more organisms, are great tools to understand metabolic functions and landscapes, as well as propose engineering targets to improve metabolite production or propose novel drug targets. Previous reviews on yeast GEMs have mainly focused on the history and the evaluation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae modeling paradigms or the accessibility and usability of yeast GEMs. However, they did not describe the reconstruction strategies, limitations, validations, challenges, and research gaps of non-conventional yeast GEMs. Herein, we focused on the reconstruction of available non- Saccharomyces GEMs, their validation, underscoring the physiological insights, as well as the identification of both metabolic engineering and drug targets. We also discuss the challenges and knowledge gaps and propose strategies to boost their use and novel reconstructions.},

In this study, a genome-scale metabolic model (GEMs) was reconstructed and used to assess P. pastoris ’ metabolic capabilities for the production of S -adenosyl- l -methionine (AdoMet or SAM or SAMe) from individual carbon sources along with the addition of l -methionine. In a model-driven P. pastoris strain, the well-established genome-scale metabolic model iAUKM can be implemented to predict high valuable metabolite production. The model, iAUKM, was created by merging the previously published iMT1026 model and the draught model generated using Raven toolbox from the KEGG database which covered 2309 enzymatic reactions associated with 1033 metabolic genes and 1750 metabolites. The highly curated model was successful in capturing P. pastoris growth on various carbon sources, as well as AdoMet production under various growth conditions. Many overexpression gene targets for increasing AdoMet accumulation in the cell have been predicted for various carbon sources. Inorganic phosphatase (IPP) was one of the predicted overexpression targets as revealed from simulations using iAUKM. When IPP gene was integrated into P. pastoris , we found that AdoMet accumulation increased by 16},

Despite their wide usage in biotechnology, biomedicine and fundamental studies, there are many phenotypes that GEMs are unable to correctly predict. GECKO is a method to improve the predictive power of a GEM by incorporating enzymatic constraints using kinetic and omics data. GECKO has enabled reconstruction of enzyme-constrained metabolic models (ecModels) for diverse organisms, which show better predictive performance than conventional GEMs. In this protocol, we describe how to use the latest version GECKO 3.0; the procedure has five stages: (1) expansion from a starting metabolic model to an ecModel structure, (2) integration of enzyme turnover numbers into the ecModel structure, (3) model tuning, (4) integration of proteomics data into the ecModel and (5) simulation and analysis of ecModels. GECKO 3.0 incorporates deep learning-predicted enzyme kinetics, paving the way for improved metabolic models for virtually any organism and cell line in the absence of experimental data. The time of running the whole protocol is organism dependent, e.g.,  5 h for yeast. Genome-scale metabolic models have the potential to predict changes in phenotype resulting from different environmental conditions. Their predictive power can be improved by including more information about the enzyme kinetics. GECKO is a program that gives users an automated and manual mechanism to incorporate relevant data. The protocol also describes how to tune the program to compensate for incorrect or missing values. Genome-scale metabolic models enable mathematical exploration of metabolism under various defined conditions. This protocol describes GECKO, a method for enhancing a genome-scale metabolic model with enzymatic constraints using kinetic and omics data (e.g., proteomics).},

Streamlined integration of enzyme constraints and proteomics data into such models was first enabled by the GECKO toolbox, allowing the study of phenotypes constrained by protein limitations. Here, we upgrade the toolbox in order to enhance models with enzyme and proteomics constraints for any organism with a compatible GEM reconstruction. With this, enzyme-constrained models for the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Yarrowia lipolytica and Kluyveromyces marxianus are generated to study their long-term adaptation to several stress factors by incorporation of proteomics data. Predictions reveal that upregulation and high saturation of enzymes in amino acid metabolism are common across organisms and conditions, suggesting the relevance of metabolic robustness in contrast to optimal protein utilization as a cellular objective for microbial growth under stress and nutrient-limited conditions. The functionality of GECKO is expanded with an automated framework for continuous and version-controlled update of enzyme-constrained GEMs, also producing such models for Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens . In this work, we facilitate the utilization of enzyme-constrained GEMs in basic science, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology purposes.

However, the feasibility of such growth-associated pathway designs depends on the type of target compound. In the present study, FBA predicted a set of gene deletions ( pykA , pykF , ppc , zwf , and adhE ) that leads to growth-associated phenylalanine production in Escherichia coli . The knockout strain is theoretically enforced to produce phenylalanine only at high growth yields, and could not be applied to the ALE experiment because of a severe growth defect. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach for ALE based on mutualistic co-culture for coupling growth and production, regardless of the growth rate. We designed a synthetic mutualism of a phenylalanine-producing leucine-auxotrophic strain (KF strain) and a leucine-producing phenylalanine-auxotrophic strain (KL strain) and performed an ALE experiment for approximately 160 generations. The evolved KF strain (KF-E strain) grew in a synthetic medium (with glucose as the main carbon source) supplemented with leucine, while severe growth defects were observed in the parental KF strain. The phenylalanine yield of the KF-E strain was 2.3 times higher than that of the KF strain.},

  abstract     = {Malik, Guo et al. show that Ntrk2/Trkb-mediated neurotrophic signalling regulates dopamine levels by controlling glutathione–ascorbate metabolism, thus impacting striatal dopaminergic circuits and motor function Identifying initial triggering events in neurodegenerative disorders is critical to developing preventive therapies. In Huntington’s disease (HD), hyperdopaminergia—probably triggered by the dysfunction of the most affected neurons, indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs)—is believed to induce hyperkinesia, an early stage HD symptom. However, how this change arises and contributes to HD pathogenesis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of iSPNs function by Ntrk2/Trkb deletion in mice results in increased striatal dopamine and midbrain dopaminergic neurons, preceding hyperkinetic dysfunction. Transcriptomic analysis of iSPNs at the pre-symptomatic stage showed de-regulation of metabolic pathways, including upregulation of Gsto2 , encoding glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO2). Selectively reducing Gsto2 in iSPNs in vivo effectively prevented dopaminergic dysfunction and halted the onset and progression of hyperkinetic symptoms. This study uncovers a functional link between altered iSPN BDNF-TrkB signalling, glutathione–ascorbate metabolism and hyperdopaminergic state, underscoring the vital role of GSTO2 in maintaining dopamine balance.},

However, their therapeutic potential in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been explored. Here, we develop a DUB discovery pipeline, combining activity-based proteomics with a loss-of-function genetic screen in patient-derived PDAC organoids and murine genetic models. This approach identifies USP25 as a master regulator of PDAC growth and maintenance. Genetic and pharmacological USP25 inhibition results in potent growth impairment in PDAC organoids, while normal pancreatic organoids are insensitive, and causes dramatic regression of patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, USP25 deubiquitinates and stabilizes the HIF-1α transcription factor. PDAC is characterized by a severely hypoxic microenvironment, and USP25 depletion abrogates HIF-1α transcriptional activity and impairs glycolysis, inducing PDAC cell death in the tumor hypoxic core. Thus, the USP25/HIF-1α axis is an essential mechanism of metabolic reprogramming and survival in PDAC, which can be therapeutically exploited. The biological roles of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not fully explored. Here the authors perform activity based proteomics with a loss of function genetic screen and identify that USP25 promotes PDAC growth and survival through HIF-1 protein stability and transcriptional activity.},

  abstract     = {Background Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction tools have been developed in the last decades. They have helped to reconstruct eukaryotic and prokaryotic metabolic models, which have contributed to fields, e.g., genetic engineering, drug discovery, prediction of phenotypes, and other model-driven discoveries. However, the use of these programs requires a high level of bioinformatic skills. Moreover, the functionalities required to build models are scattered throughout multiple tools, requiring knowledge and experience for utilizing several tools. Results Here we present ChiMera, which combines tools used for model reconstruction, prediction, and visualization. ChiMera uses CarveMe in the reconstruction module, generating a gap-filled draft reconstruction able to produce growth predictions using flux balance analysis for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ChiMera also contains two modules for metabolic network visualization. The first module generates maps for the most important pathways, e.g., glycolysis, nucleotides and amino acids biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation and biosynthesis and core-metabolism. The second module produces a genome-wide metabolic map, which can be used to retrieve KEGG pathway information for each compound in the model. A module to investigate gene essentiality and knockout is also present. Conclusions Overall, ChiMera uses automation algorithms to combine a variety of tools to automatically perform model creation, gap-filling, flux balance analysis (FBA), and metabolic network visualization. ChiMera models readily provide metabolic insights that can aid genetic engineering projects, prediction of phenotypes, and model-driven discoveries.},

  abstract     = {Background Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a well-known bioinformatics tool for metabolic engineering design. Previously, we have successfully used single-level FBA to design metabolic fluxes in Bacillus subtilis to enhance ( R , R )-2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) production from glycerol. OptKnock is another powerful technique for devising gene deletion strategies to maximize microbial growth coupling with improved biochemical production. It has never been used in B. subtilis . In this study, we aimed to compare the use of single-level FBA and OptKnock for designing enhanced 2,3-BD production from glycerol in B. subtilis . Results Single-level FBA and OptKnock were used to design metabolic engineering approaches for B. subtilis to enhance 2,3-BD production from glycerol. Single-level FBA indicated that deletion of ackA , pta , lctE , and mmgA would improve the production of 2,3-BD from glycerol, while OptKnock simulation suggested the deletion of ackA , pta , mmgA , and zwf . Consequently, strains LM01 (single-level FBA-based) and MZ02 (OptKnock-based) were constructed, and their capacity to produce 2,3-BD from glycerol was investigated. The deletion of multiple genes did not negatively affect strain growth and glycerol utilization. The highest 2,3-BD production was detected in strain LM01. Strain MZ02 produced 2,3-BD at a similar level as the wild type, indicating that the OptKnock prediction was erroneous. Two-step FBA was performed to examine the reason for the erroneous OptKnock prediction. Interestingly, we newly found that zwf gene deletion in strain MZ02 improved lactate production, which has never been reported to date. The predictions of single-level FBA for strain MZ02 were in line with experimental findings. Conclusions We showed that single-level FBA is an effective approach for metabolic design and manipulation to enhance 2,3-BD production from glycerol in B. subtilis . Further, while this approach predicted the phenotypes of generated strains with high precision, OptKnock prediction was not accurate. We suggest that OptKnock modelling predictions be evaluated by using single-level FBA to ensure the accuracy of metabolic pathway design. Furthermore, the zwf gene knockout resulted in the change of metabolic fluxes to enhance the lactate productivity.},

Over the last decade, evidence has pointed to a link between MIRO1 and Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis. Moreover, a heterozygous MIRO1 mutation (p.R272Q) was identified in a PD patient, from which an iPSC-derived midbrain organoid model was derived, showing MIRO1 mutant-dependent selective loss of dopaminergic neurons. Herein, we use patient-specific iPSC-derived midbrain organoids carrying the MIRO1 p.R272Q mutation to further explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis and metabolic modeling we show that the MIRO1 p.R272Q mutation affects the dopaminergic neuron developmental path leading to metabolic deficits and disrupted neuron-astrocyte metabolic crosstalk, which might represent an important pathogenic mechanism leading to their loss.},

  abstract     = {A relevance vector machine (RVM) based demand prediction model is explored for efficient seismic fragility analysis (SFA) of a bridge structure. The proposed RVM model integrates both record-to-record variations of ground motions and uncertainties of parameters characterizing the bridge model. For efficient fragility computation, ground motion intensity is included as an added dimension to the demand prediction model. To incorporate different sources of uncertainty, random realizations of different structural parameters are generated using Latin hypercube sampling technique. Mean fragility, along with its dispersions, is estimated based on the log-normal fragility model for different critical components of a bridge. The effectiveness of the proposed RVM model-based SFA of a bridge structure is elucidated numerically by comparing it with fragility results obtained by the commonly used SFA approaches, while considering the most accurate direct Monte Carlo simulation-based fragility estimates as the benchmark. The proposed RVM model provides a more accurate estimate of fragility than conventional approaches, with significantly less computational effort. In addition, the proposed model provides a measure of uncertainty in fragility estimates by constructing confidence intervals for the fragility curves.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the seismic mitigation of typical storage tanks where extreme loading conditions are considered by safe shutdown earthquakes. To reproduce the main dynamic properties of the superstructure, a standard structural model was considered, where both the presence of the impulsive mode and of the convective mode were considered. Thus, to protect the tank from strong earthquakes, finite locally resonant multiple-degrees-of-freedom (MDoFs) metafoundations were designed and developed; and resonator parameters together with bistable columns were optimized by means of an improved time domain multiobjective optimization procedure. Also, the stochastic nature of the seismic input was taken into account. Therefore, it is proposed: (i) a linear metafoundation endowed with one/two layers and multiple cells, linear springs, and linear viscous dampers; and (ii) a relevant foundation equipped with columns operating in an elastic buckled state. With this arrangement, additional flexibility and dissipation against horizontal seismic loadings are activated. It was shown in both cases, how each metafoundation can be successfully optimized via a sensitivity-based parameter technique. Thus, the performance of the optimized metafoundations was assessed by means of time history analyses; and results were compared with a storage tank endowed with both rigid foundation solutions. Finally, single cells were analysed in the frequency domain while finite lattices and periodic metafoundations in the linear and bistable regime were characterized by means of dispersion relationships.},

However, it was observed that most of the high-rise structures show irregularities in form of mass, stiffness, strength, plan, etc. The irregularities occur due to the architectural designs, non-orthogonal placement of columns, irregular placement of mass in structure, etc. The researchers observed that the irregular structures could not be analysed using the regular methods as given in the design codes as the codes consider the regular structures. Methods Therefore, different methods were developed for analysis of seismic irregularities. The methods for analysing irregular structures under the seismic loads are static methods such as equivalent lateral force method and pushover analysis, and dynamic methods such as Response Spectrum Analysis and Time History Method. Results From the study, it was observed that the non-linear time history analysis, increment dynamic analysis, considers several intensity of ground vibrations to perform nonlinear analysis. Therefore, the method performs well against the other analytical techniques as all the scaled ground motions are recorded to predict the damage due to earthquake. Conclusion Though the method requires high precision, due to high ground vibration sensitivity, and is costly, it shows high accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy affects 50 million people globally, which requires a real-time, low-power, and low-latency seizure detector to address the problem. An IoT-enabled real-time, energy-efficient, and fast seizure detector has been presented. The seizure detector consists of four crucial components: 1. Pulse exclusion mechanism (PEM) or neighborhood component analysis (NCA) for the selection of weighted channels, 2. Optimal feature extraction, 3. RBO optimized 
$$\kappa $$
 κ -nearest neighbor classifier for seizure detection, and 4. Internet of medical things (IoMT) for remote medical services. The proposed system used two models for weighted channel selection: one uses PEM and the other uses NCA. Key features have been extracted from the weighted channels in a specified timing interval, and later, seizure detection is performed using RBO optimized 
$$\kappa $$
 κ -NN classifier. Both software and hardware validation were performed to evaluate the proposed approach. When PEM and RBO are used together, the system’s latency is reduced dramatically while retaining optimal accuracy. The experimental results from software simulation and hardware implementation show that the proposed seizure detector outperforms the current state of the art and provides essential contributions to smart healthcare.},

The seismic resilience of a hospital building can be quantified with reference to post-earthquake recovery time. Studies in the literature have reported that the seismic resilience of the overall system is dependent on both structural member damage and non-structural component (NSC) damage to the building due to a considered earthquake hazard level. The evaluation of the seismic resilience of a building primarily involves the selection of suitable metrics for measuring the quality of infrastructure, modeling the losses due to damage and the time required to restore to the pre-disaster performance level. The current study explores this concept and reviews the procedures in existing research to estimate the seismic resilience of hospitals. Furthermore, a simplified methodology for estimating the seismic resilience of an existing hospital building is demonstrated through seismic fragility analysis.},

  abstract     = {Structural capacity evaluation is essential to support the safety assessment and decision-making process of existing building structures after disastrous earthquakes. Current post-earthquake evaluation practices rely more on manual on-site inspections, which are labor-intensive and subjective. A simulation-based capacity evaluation could be a desired alternative when numerical models for these buildings are prior-identified and updated using structural health monitoring data. This study proposes a procedure for identifying the capacity curve and assessing the residual capacity of existing structures using seismic monitoring data. The mass-normalized spectral acceleration-displacement (AD format) relation is first defined in a single-degree-of-freedom system. Considering the post-event deterioration of structural capacity, a data-driven reduction factor for the capacity curve is introduced to quantify the potential structural degradation. With the aid of the updated capacity curve, the residual capacity of the earthquake-damaged structure is then predicted via incremental dynamic analysis. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are analyzed via numerical simulations and further validated using a large-scale shaking table test and a real-world instrumented building. Results show that the proposed method could identify the capacity curve of the existing structure from seismic monitoring data and estimate the hysteresis responses with a favorable agreement. It could provide the residual capacity of the target structure and quantify its capacity reduction, which can informatively facilitate the post-earthquake structural safety management.},

In this work, we present a network side channel based attack to steal model sensitive information. Specifically, we leverage the unique communication patterns during training to learn the model architectures. To further improve accuracy, we also collect information from software based power side channels and correlate it with the information extracted from network.

  abstract     = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) plays a critical role in a wide range of linear algebra computations, particularly in scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the irregular memory access patterns, extensive memory usage, high bandwidth requirements, and underutilization of parallelism hinder the computational efficiency of SpMV on GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called block-wise dynamic mixed-precision (BDMP) to address these challenges. Our methodology involves partitioning the original matrix into uniformly sized blocks, with each block’s size determined by considering architectural characteristics and accuracy requirements. Additionally, we dynamically assign precision to each block using a precision selection method that takes into account the value distribution of the original sparse matrix. We develop two distinct SpMV computation algorithms for BDMP: BDMP-PBP (Precision-based partitioning) and BDMP-TCKI (Tailored compression and kernel implementation). BDMP-PBP partitions the matrix into two independent matrices for separate computations based on block precision, offering flexibility for integration with other optimization techniques. Meanwhile, BDMP-TCKI focuses on achieving significant thread-level parallelism and memory utilization by tailoring an appropriate compressed storage format and kernel implementation for each block. We compare BDMP with NVIDIA’s cuSPARSE library and three state-of-the-art SpMV methods, including SELLP, MergeBase, and BalanceCSR, using matrices from the University of Florida’s SuiteSparse dataset collection. BDMP-PBP and BDMP-TCKI show average speedups up to 2.64

Nevertheless, the relationship between DFAC and AIC is positively mediated by MCBMI. The findings of this investigation would function as a reliable foundation for future research endeavors, as well as for the advancement of scientific comprehension by expanding the current scope of this research line. From a practical perspective, these critical insights could facilitate the development of strategies that are specifically tailored to the implementation of circular business models, as well as policies and regulations that are pertinent to the incorporation of Metaverse platforms to enhance SMEs’ internationalization performance.},
