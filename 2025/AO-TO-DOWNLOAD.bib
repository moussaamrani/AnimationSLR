This paper presents a strategy for generating Simulink models from verified hybridised Event-B models, which use a correct-by-construction approach to progressively build both types of behaviours. A key challenge in simulating these models is synchronising the discrete and continuous elements. Our objective is to translate hybridised Event-B models into Simulink, with Stateflow representing the discrete components and MATLAB function blocks for the continuous ones. We illustrate this process through a water tank case study, demonstrating formal modelling, verification, and subsequent simulation of the generated Simulink model.},

	abstract = {Robotic technologies have not only been used in factories, but increasingly in various environments in people’s daily lives. Robots are used as assistive devices and through interaction with these devices it is possible to expand the physical and cognitive capabilities of humans. A new class of robots, Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), arises from the intersection of two other classes, assistive robots, which provide assistance, usually in healthcare settings, and interactive social robots, that communicate with the user. This work proposes an XML-based domain specific language (DSL) to facilitate the specification of interactive sessions for SARs. The proposed language is called EvaML and was designed for an open-source robotics platform. Although firstly implemented and used with EVA, EvaML can also be used with other SARs with similar communication affordances. To evaluate the EvaML language, an experiment was conducted with 12 software developers. Participants assessed EvaML with regards to clarity, effectiveness, perceived ease of use and usability according to 9 cognitive dimensions of the CDN framework (Cognitive Dimensions of Notations). EvaML was also successfully used by another group of 12 high school students and teachers in a series of activities where they designed and implemented interactive educational applications for EVA. Results indicate that EvaML is perceived as easy to use and usable, making it an adequate tool to enact interaction designs for a SAR platform considering different user profiles and levels of knowledge.},

Different languages have been proposed recently enabling to facilitate the modeling process and shorten the development life-cycle. However, these languages may be used at one or many modeling steps regarding the semantics of their artefacts. Capella language is one of these languages that gained popularity recently. It is dedicated to system engineering and its use may very beneficial for safety-critical system. However, designing with Capella is considered as semi-formal. Thus, the approach presented in this paper stands for systematic formal verification of Capella’s behavioral models using Event-B method in a transparent way. Our proposal translates Capella models into Event-B specifications using automatic model-to-model transformations dedicated to Capella designers. The verification of correctness of the transformed models is provided by the ProB model-checker. An automatic lighting system is treated as a case study to validate of our contribution.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the fundamental pillars of the digital transformation of society, with favorable impacts on people’s quality of life. Furthermore, IoT systems generate large volumes of data at very high speeds, which come from diverse sources (heterogeneous sensors), requiring the permanent adaptation of the content and the way of presenting the information to the user; hence, a low-level implementation approach becomes unproductive. In this context, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has proven to be an appropriate software development approach to cope with the complexity and evolution of IoT systems. However, there are few proposals for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) aimed at building dashboards that synthesize the metrics and fundamental monitoring data of an IoT system. Therefore, this paper proposes a DSL and a model-based transformation engine to design and automatically implement IoT dashboard visualization web applications that combine pages, panels, charts, grids, data filters, hyperlinks, and labels with warnings and prescriptive recommendations. In addition, the proposed solution abstracts implementation details from heterogeneous data sources (physical and virtual sensors), making them transparent to domain experts. The empirical evaluation of the solution through a quasi-experiment based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) showed that the participants perceived the solution as useful and easy to use, so they would be willing to use it in the future.},

We show that executable models of behaviour are significantly more decomposable when using a time-triggered semantics than an event-driven semantics. Therefore, we adopt logic-labelled finite machines LLFSMs and show that deterministic static schedules are derived to guarantee value-domain properties and time-domain properties. We illustrate that such a decomposition goes a long way in avoiding the combinatorial space explosion that occurs when attempting to formally verify executable behaviour models. We argue for parametrised machines to foster decomposability and analyse what aspects jeopardise taming the size of Kripke structures for formal verification. We provide three case studies to show that we can transform the models into small, timed Kripke structures and that components can be verified separately by the nuXmv model checker to achieve formal system verification.},

	abstract = {Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) combines the rigor of systems engineering with formal models to support communication in multidisciplinary engineering. With industrial adoption of MBSE, the maturity of modeling environments supporting MBSE increased. Still, efficient means to integrate computational design methods in MBSE are missing. Here, we present a method that enables systems engineers to directly integrate computational methods for solving design tasks. The method relies on established semantics of the systems modeling language (SysML) and therefore can be directly integrated with existing system models so to avoid redundant knowledge formalizations for computational methods. Next, model transformations are applied to generate the mathematical model based on the relevant parts of the system model. These temporary models are used to solve the design task and generate output that is fed back to the system model. Therefore, the proposed method contributes by relying on a single and comprehensible knowledge formalization understandable to engineers. Further, it enables systems engineers to formalize design tasks for automated reasoning themselves by bundling the complexity of the mathematical modeling within the model transformations. An industrial case for designing sealing elements for piping is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach. Future work needs to further elaborate on automated selection of appropriate mathematical methods as well as computational support for the identification of opportunities for integration of computational design methods readily while developing a system model.},

A large corpus of literature has indeed grown up over the years, pointing out the problems related to the modeling abstraction process, the usability of tools, or the practical difficulty of using modeling languages. While these works identify problems, few of them focus on proposing directions to explore in order to fix them. To move toward a smoother and less constraining modeling experience and then increase the added value of modeling approaches, it is necessary to identify new paths to improve current tooling. In this paper, we explore one specific path by investigating how new software assistance features could support users performing modeling tasks that they perceive as complex. We used UML knowledge as a criterion for the selection of participants and built a questionnaire general to software modeling. We followed a user-centered research approach and collected the feedback from practitioners who use the modeling languages and the modeling tools on a regular basis in an industrial context. This article reports on a set of individual interview sessions with 16 modeling experts about how they perform modeling and how they imagine assistance in the context of their work. From the analysis of this qualitative study, we draw twelve observations on how to design software assistants for software modeling. These observations highlight research directions for both tool vendors and academics to explore, to identify and design new solutions to the friction points of the software modeling experience.},

Such assistance will help improve the quality of software models, support education for students learning modeling, and lower the entry barriers to new modelers. We present SimIMA, an intelligent modeling assistant for Simulink, which is an extremely popular modeling language in both industry and academia. SimIMA provides modelers with two different forms of data-driven guidance using a knowledge base of configurable repositories and sources. The first form of guidance, SimGESTION, suggests to modelers single-step operations they can perform on their models as they edit them in their modeling environment. These suggestions are based on the machine learning technique of ensemble learning through association rule mining and frequency classification. The second form of guidance, SimXAMPLE, presents modelers with similar/related Simulink systems for modelers to either insert directly into their environments or to view for inspiration. SimXAMPLE accomplishes this through model clone detection. To validate SimIMA, we conduct experiments using an established, open, and curated large set of Simulink models coming from a variety of application domains. Our results show that both of SimIMA’s forms of guidance are inferring the appropriate model and element suggestions given SimIMA’s knowledge base and that SimIMA is both scalable and efficient.

This research explores the process of extending network management platforms, focusing specifically on a management platform in use at TELUS, a leading Canadian communication and IT company. The TELUS Intelligent Network Automation and Analytics (TINAA) is a model-driven control and management ecosystem. TINAA uses MDE techniques and YANG, a data modeling language widely used in the networking domain, to facilitate the implementation of new network functions. More specifically, to add a network function to TINAA, the following process is used: (1) The function is described using YANG. (2) Skeleton code is generated from these models. (3) The skeleton code is modified and completed as appropriate by a developer. In particular, we demonstrate how YANG’s language extension mechanism, combined with code clone detection and removal, can capture essential information at the model level and generate cleaner, more readable skeleton code, significantly simplifying the manual code completion process. We evaluate our techniques using the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM), a widely adopted model for managing and configuring Layer 3 VPN services.

The integration of an interface design for action modeling inspired by Petri Nets and the use of symbols for encoding conditions, actions and outcomes, allowed players to model complex sequences of behavior, recognize patterns, decompose in-game activities, and work with abstractions such as conditions, consequences and steps. This enabled players’ articulation of cause-and-effect relationships, leading to the consolidation of computational thinking skills.

The feasibility and efficiency of a distributed simulation of these large-scale models is strongly dependent of the information that can be obtained from the models, previously to the simulation process itself. This information can give assistance to the generation of an initial partition of the model, allowing a well balanced workload among the individual simulation engines deployed, or in the generation of the predicates to be evaluated in order to determine the enabling of transitions; or the computation of look-ahead information in conservative strategies of distributed simulation. Petri nets allow to obtain information from the structure that can be used to advance conclusions or properties about the course of a simulation. This information can be usefull either independently of the considered initial marking, or parameterised by its initial choice. This structural information can be obtained in modelling phase, completed in simulation time and re-elaborated from the simulation results, and therefore associated to the model or modules of the model in such a way that can be harnessed in further simulations where these nets will be used. Last but no least, the maintenance of the structure of the Petri net during the simulation (in an interpreted simulation instead of a compiled one) allows to make load balancing during the simulation or to federate with legacy simulators, in an easier way than using other kind of specification models or simulation schemes.},

The tool-chain relies on IOPT nets (Input-Output Place-Transition nets) to describe the controller behavior, allowing an explicit representation of constraints on input and output signals and events, which is necessary for the development of controllers. The IOPT-Tools tool-chain includes tools for interactive graphical IOPT nets models editing, simulation and test (token-player, timing diagram, remote debugging), as well as a state-space generator, state-space visualization, and a query system for properties verification. The tool-chain also supports the automatic generation of execution code to be directly deployed in the controllers’ implementation platforms, such as FPGA boards, as well as Arduino, Raspberry, and other Linux-based boards. Most notably, it is possible to obtain C code and VHDL code to be directly deployed into the referred boards without writing/changing a line in the generated code. The tool-chain uses the PNML format for storing the models and can import PNML models generated by other frameworks, automatically generating, if necessary, an associated graphical representation. After, it is possible to add input and output signals and events to create controller models. IOPT-Tools also supports net operations, namely net addition, allowing composition of sub-models, and net splitting, which in conjunction with the use of clock domains and dedicated communication channels support the development of distributed controllers.},
