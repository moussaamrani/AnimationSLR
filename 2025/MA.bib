  abstract  = {Pre-trained language models, like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), have reached the highest level in many natural speech tasks. On the other hand, the size of the embedding matrices makes it complicated to tailor such models to specific domains or use them in resource-constrained environments. This research work present an innovative method that applies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress token embeddings of a topic-specific vocabulary, thereby significantly reducing the model’s size while retaining its performance at the task. VAE-based compression is used on the medical corpus and show that a compressed model attains accuracy at the level of 89},

  abstract  = {When validating formal models, sizable effort goes into ensuring two types of properties: safety properties (nothing bad happens) and liveness properties (something good occurs eventually. Event-B supports checking safety properties all through the refinement chain. The same is not valid for liveness properties. Liveness properties are commonly validated with additional techniques like animation, and results do not transfer quickly, leading to re-doing the validation process at every refinement stage. This paper promotes early validation by providing failure divergence refinement semantics for Event-B. We show that failure divergence refinement preserves trace properties, which comprise many liveness properties, under certain natural conditions. Consequently, re-validation of those properties becomes unnecessary. Our result benefits data refinements, where no abstract behavior should be removed during refinement. Furthermore, we lay out an algorithm and provide a tool for automatic failure divergence refinement checking, significantly decreasing the modeler’s workload. The tool is compared and evaluated in the context of sizable case studies.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-risk management has increasingly been pushed into the boardroom in the last two years. Governing and overseeing cyber-risks became a group process in which board members implement over time an investment strategy that considers operational, financial, and economic factors in addition to technical aspects, and needs to adapt and evolve according to the company’s cybersecurity posture and the ever-changing threat scenario. However, not all members have solid backgrounds in information technology and cybersecurity, which further complicates matters. The authors developed a management dashboard game leveraging the benefits of the natural user interface (NUI) that fosters an understandable and collaborative environment to provide an education tool about cyber-risks management through proper budget allocation. Our work shows that board members learn about cyber-risk management issues and achieve better results operating collectively than they would do acting individually, regardless of uncertainty. Cyber-risk dashboard design enhanced with exploratory and interactive simulation environment in a collaborative board settings are critical elements to excel in cyber-risk governance and oversight.},

  abstract  = {The widespread adoption of Software as a Service (SaaS) has led providers to offer diverse pricing to meet varying customer needs. However, there is currently no methodology for eliciting and designing these structures. In this paper, we present our experience in defining a pricing for CCSIM, an advanced simulator designed for deploying virtualized, highly customizable cloud continuum architectures that initially lacked one. As a result, CCSIM improved its transparency for customers- allowing them to better understand the offered features and their associated costs- and increased provider profitability. Building on this practical experience and towards our vision of pricings as software artifacts, we devise a first approach towards a process that we term “SaaS pricification” -a method for defining consistent, easily manageable, and profitable pricings. In short, this work introduces SaaS pricification as a step towards integrating pricings into SaaS products lifecycle, offering an initial approach derived from the practical experience of pricifying CCSIM.},

In the design of the control flow, the function block of the IEC 61499 standard will use an execution control chart to describe its behavior. An operation state machine is designed to describe the operation of the function block. It is necessary to consider the interaction between the execution control chart and the operation state machine for control behavior descriptions. The function block model cannot be directly used as the input of model checkers, so it needs to be transformed formally and semantically equivalently to the input models of formal verification tools. This paper proposes a method to automatically transform the function block model into a finite automata model. We use bisimulation to prove that the behavior of the transformed finite automata model is consistent with that of the function block. We further demonstrate that the transformed finite automata model is used as the input to the model checker for formal verification.},

However, current studies lack sufficient information for systematic parameter optimization and differentiation from conventional non-replicating mRNA (NRM). Therefore, the transfection efficiency of NRM and SAM platforms was evaluated by comparing delivery vectors and optimizing parameters for the SAM protocol. SAM and NRM showed similar transfection preferences, but their efficiencies differed. Optimized SAM transfection parameters were then established, including dose and incubation time. In this study, an in vitro multi-parameter delivery system for SAM was constructed, providing valuable insights into SAM transfection and its distinction from regular mRNA. This study contributes an experimental basis for the rational screening of nucleic acid drug carriers and the establishment of SAM multi-parameter evaluation criteria, and also lays an important foundation for optimizing low-dose immunization strategies and their clinical application translation.

  abstract  = {Similarity-based model matching is the cornerstone of model versioning. It pairs model elements based on a distance metric (e.g., edit distance). However, calculating the distances between elements is computationally expensive. Consequently, a similarity-based matcher typically suffers from performance issues when the model size increases. Based on observation, there are two main causes of the high computation cost: (1) when matching an element p , the matcher calculates the distance between p and every candidate element q , despite the obvious dissimilarity between p and q ; (2) the matcher always calculates the distance between p and 
$$q'$$
 q ′ , even though q and 
$$q'$$
 q ′ are very similar and the distance between p and q is already known. This paper proposes a dual-hash-based approach, which employs two entirely different hashing techniques—similarity-preserving hashing and integrity-based hashing—to accelerate similarity-based model matching. With similarity-preserving hashing, our approach can quickly filter out the dissimilar candidate elements according to their similarity hashes computed using our similarity-preserving hash function, which maps an element to a 64-bit binary hash. With integrity-based hashing, our approach can cache and reuse computed distance values by associating them with the checksums of model elements. We also propose an index structure to facilitate hash-based model matching. Our approach has been implemented and integrated into EMF Compare. We evaluate our approach using open-source Ecore and UML models. The results show that our hash function is effective in preserving the similarity between model elements and our matching approach reduces time costs by 20–88},

  abstract  = {The modern theory of functional programming languages uses monads for encoding computational side-effects and side-contexts, beyond bare-bone program logic. Even though quantum computing is intrinsically side-effectful (as in quantum measurement) and context-dependent (as on mixed ancillary states), little of this monadic paradigm has previously been brought to bear on quantum programming languages. Here, we systematically analyze the (co)monads on categories of parameterized module spectra which are induced by Grothendieck’s “motivic yoga of operations”—for the present purpose specialized to 
$$H{\mathbb {C}}$$
 H C -modules and further to set-indexed complex vector spaces, as discussed in a companion article (Sati and Schreiber in Entanglement of sections. arXiv:2309.07245 ). Interpreting an indexed vector space as a collection of alternative possible quantum state spaces parameterized by quantum measurement results, as familiar from Proto- -semantics, we find that these (co)monads provide a comprehensive natural language for functional quantum programming with classical control and with “dynamic lifting” of quantum measurement results back into classical contexts. We close by indicating a domain-specific quantum programming language ( ) expressing these monadic quantum effects in transparent do -notation, embeddable into the recently constructed Linear Homotopy Type Theory ( ) which interprets into parameterized module spectra. Once embedded into , this should make for formally verifiable universal quantum programming with linear quantum types, classical control, dynamic lifting, and notably also with topological effects (as discussed in the companion article Myers et al. in Commun Math Phys 405:172, 2024).},

In the receiver, coherent detection replaces traditional direct detection for decryption, to precisely recover the encrypted amplitude and phase information. Numerical results indicate that this method maintains a low correlation between 40Gb/s QAM plaintext and chaotic encrypted data in both intensity and phase, boosting communication system security. The bit error rate remains below 4.7 × 10^–4 over a 120 km optical fiber link. System performance is assessed by examining the effects of hardware parameter mismatches. This scheme offers a practical solution for future high-speed, long-distance secure optical communication systems.},

The method is called FTA-AK-SS, based on the active learning Kriging (AK) model, subset simulation (SS) algorithm, and fault tree analysis (FTA). According to the principle of FTA, we established the fault tree model of the WETUV to determine its minimum cut set and bottom events. Then we defined the random variables affecting its reliability. The U learning function was used to selectively add the sample points of random variables to update the initial Kriging surrogate model. At the same time, combined with the SS algorithm, the reliability and sensitivity analyses of the WETUV were realized. The result shows that compared with the traditional Monte Carlo simulation and FTA-Kriging-SS methods, the proposed method significantly improves the calculation efficiency of the WETUV under the premise of ensuring calculation accuracy. The reliability of the WETUV is greatly affected by the rubber pad’s aging, the receiver coil’s corrosion, and the position deviation. This study can provide a new way to realize a high-efficiency reliability calculation and analysis for urethral valves.},

  abstract  = {Understanding driving behaviour can support strategies to improve road safety. Anticipating dangerous situations and warning drivers has been a matter of extensive studies. However, there is a lack of research integrating safety, volatility in driving decisions, and vehicle operational mode in driving analysis for different road conditions. The main objective of this paper is to develop a decision support system that evaluates driver performance and provides information on safety, volatility, and operational performance, using specific variables such as time headway, stopping distance, acceleration, vehicular jerk, and vehicle-specific power mode. The proposed model is called Driving-Safety-Volatility-Operational (DSVO) indicator. To validate DSVO, a microscopic traffic model in VISSIM was calibrated using traffic and dynamics (1 Hz resolution) from probe vehicles along two highways with different traffic volumes and toll systems. Each driver’s performance was classified based on the proposed DSVO indicator. The decision on safety was supported based on a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Trajectory files were exported to the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) to correlate driving assessment with traffic conflicts. DSVO proved to be effective when correlated with SSAM conflict analysis mainly with the contribution of volatility failures. Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) methodology was used to calculate the VSP mode, allowing to evaluate the driver’s operating performance. The variables incorporated into the driving indicator are vehicular factors that influence accidents and pollutant emissions. Therefore, there is a potential to include this indicator in an electronic vehicle unit.},

  abstract  = {Dream11, a leading virtual gaming platform for fantasy sports, has experienced substantial revenue growth, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which curtailed outdoor sports due to mobility restrictions and led to a surge in interest in fantasy sports. This study examines the antecedents and consequences of engaging with various sports on the Dream11 platform, including cricket, football (soccer), baseball, basketball, and handball. Using bibliometric analysis and statistical methods, the research explores the dynamics of fantasy sports participation and its impact on revenue generation for online gaming platforms. Additionally, a survey was conducted to collect primary data from Dream11 users, along with the validation of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) results through statistical analysis. The findings reveal limited global academic engagement in fantasy sports research and highlight that cricket is the most popular sport with the highest rating and priority among male participants on Dream11. Interestingly, the inverse correlation among sports-based factors suggests that satisfaction and areas for improvement are negatively linked. Furthermore, insights into Dream11’s revenue streams demonstrate the platform’s capacity to leverage strategic revenue management and diversification to sustain growth in the virtual gaming market. This study offers strategic recommendations for developing and sustaining fantasy sports platforms, emphasizing the importance of optimizing revenue streams and adapting to evolving consumer preferences.},

  abstract  = {A proposition is derivationally robust precisely when it is a prediction of each model in an ensemble of models. We show that a recent and influential Bayesian defense of the epistemic merits of derivational robustness analysis faces substantial obstacles. The main reason for this is that a Bayesian characterization of derivational robustness requires one to condition on a logical or mathematical truth. Standardly, however, conditioning on a logical or mathematical truth cannot raise or lower the probability of any proposition, which means confirmation in such cases is impossible. What is required for a Bayesian defense of derivational robustness to be plausible is the adoption of a non-standard probability calculus, but the details of such an account have yet to be worked out in sufficient detail. We close by arguing against the view that agreement among multiple models has a confirmatory status that is the same or similar to agreement among multiple measurements of some quantity. It is straightforward to show that agreement among measurements has epistemic significance. This is not true for derivational robustness.},

  abstract  = {Urban traffic speed prediction is a fundamental task in Intelligent Transportation Systems. However, due to the highly nonlinear and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in traffic flow, achieving timely and accurate traffic speed prediction, particularly for long-term forecasts, remains an open challenge. To address the simultaneous modeling of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation in road network speed prediction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Convolutional Network (STAGCN). Spatially, STAGCN integrates Markov random walk–based positional encodings with raw traffic speed features to enhance the representation of network connectivity, and employs a multi-head spatial self-attention mechanism and residual convolutional layers to capture both global node interactions and local spatial patterns. Temporally, STAGCN introduces a time window–aware position encoding matrix to adaptively reweight temporal embeddings and input sequences, enhancing the model’s ability to capture periodic traffic patterns and distinguish peak-hour dynamics. A gated fusion mechanism and temporal self-attention further refine the model’s ability to distinguish evolving traffic trends. Experimental results demonstrate that STAGCN achieves state‑of‑the‑art performance in long‑horizon traffic speed prediction, validating its effectiveness in modeling spatiotemporal dependencies.},

  abstract  = {Kerala, situated in the southwestern tip of India, faced devastating floods during the summer monsoon seasons of 2018 and 2019, resulting in extensive property damage and claiming the lives of over 500 people. This study examines the critical role played by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) in triggering these consecutive flood events using reanalyses and high-resolution regional climate simulation. Analysis of ERA5 reanalysis and ocean observation dataset reveals that the shallow mixed layer in the northern west Pacific Ocean during El Niño years can lead to rapid intraseasonal variations in sea surface temperature in the region compared to the thicker mixed layer during La Niña years, facilitating eastward advancement of convective clusters of the MJO, leading to the genesis of Low Pressure Systems (LPSs) in the Bay of Bengal and the northwest Pacific Ocean. The flood event of 2018, being an El Niño year, therefore witnessed MJO propagation further east to the west Pacific Ocean. The associated extension of the monsoon jet over India led to increased vorticity to the north of its axis, supporting the formation of LPSs in the Bay of Bengal region, with enhanced precipitation over the study region, which are very well demonstrated in the high-resolution simulation. In contrast, the neutral ENSO year of 2019 experienced active MJO phases in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent during the monsoon season. These phases led to enhanced convection over the study region and the formation of LPSs, notably in the Bay of Bengal during the second week of August contributing to the flood event. This study underscores the intricate relationship between ENSO-MJO interactions, and their impact on monsoon dynamics and the need for improving model representation of ENSO-MJO interactions to enhance their predictability of extreme rainfall events during Indian summer monsoon.},

Using the microbial cell factory is an efficient and sustainable approach.

  month     = {jul},
  abstract  = {Background Research has indicated that anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis involves global network dysfunction, linking memory deficits to connectivity in the hippocampus, default mode network (DMN), and medial temporal lobe network (MTL). Most relevant cognitive studies have focused on functional connectivity (FC) rather than effective connectivity (EC), meaning that the directed interactions and causal relationships between the DMN and MTL remain unexplored. Methods Herein, we collected resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from 23 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (mean age 30.04 ± 12.67 years) and 23 matched controls (mean age 28.87 ± 9.36 years). Spectral dynamic causal modelling (spDCM) was applied to assess the effective connectivity among the 12 predefined regions of interest in the DMN and MTL. Results Effective connectivity (EC) within and between the DMN and MTL networks significantly differed in the NMDAR-resistant encephalitis group compared to controls; the positive EC within the DMN and from the MTL to the DMN was enhanced, while the negative EC from the DMN to the MTL increased, and the positive EC within the MTL decreased. The mean DMN connectivity values in the anti-NMDAR group were negatively correlated with California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and Modified Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, an effect which remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. Conclusion This study identified differences in the connectivity between the DMN and MTL networks in patients with post-acute anti-NMDAR encephalitis, suggesting a possible disconnection. The parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) mediates connections between the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Structural or functional loss of the PHG may affect the integration between the MTL memory system and DMN nodes, correlating with cognitive deficits. This study provides crucial results to improve our understanding of the directed integration between the DMN and MTL networks, providing new evidence.},

  abstract  = {Storm surges are among the most severe natural disasters affecting global coastal regions, with their increasing frequency and intensity posing significant challenges to coastal ecosystems, socioeconomic activities, and disaster resilience. The Bay of Bengal, as a region frequently impacted by tropical cyclones, faces substantial threats from storm surges. However, existing studies predominantly focus on individual storm surge events, often neglecting the cumulative effects of multiple typhoons, particularly the systematic investigation of wave-current coupling on ocean current dynamics and its spatial heterogeneity. This study employs a wave-current coupling model, combined with observational data from 23 tropical cyclone events in the Bay of Bengal from 2007 to 2024, and applies Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to explore the impacts of wave-current coupling on ocean currents. The results demonstrate that wave-current coupling has a pronounced effect on current velocity variations, particularly in coastal regions and near cyclone tracks. Spatial heterogeneity analysis reveals that local geomorphological conditions and hydrodynamic characteristics are the primary drivers of changes in current velocity and direction, with current direction being more significantly influenced by regional hydrodynamic conditions. This study highlights the critical role of wave-current coupling under multiple typhoon scenarios, providing a scientific basis for improving disaster prediction accuracy and resilience in the Bay of Bengal, while also offering theoretical support for understanding complex ocean dynamic processes.},

Nickel-based superalloys, pivotal materials for high-temperature bearing components in aeroengines, present significant challenges in the fabrication of complex parts due to their great hardness. Huge attention and rapid progress have been garnered in AM processing of nickle-based superalloys, largely owing to its distinct benefits in the freedom of fabrication and reduced manufacturing life-cycle. Despite extensive research into AM in nickel-based superalloys, the corresponding results and conclusions are scattered attributed to the variety of nickel-based superalloys and complex AM processing parameters. Therefore, there is still a pressing need for a comprehensive and deep understanding of the relationship between the AM processing and microstructures and mechanical performance of nickel-based superalloys. This review introduces the processing characteristics of four primary AM technologies utilized for superalloys and summarizes the microstructures and mechanical properties prior to and post-heat treatments. Additionally, this review presents innovative superalloys specifically accommodated to AM processing and offers insights into the material development and performance improvement, aiming to provide a valuable assessment on AM processing of nickel-based superalloys and an effective guidance for the future research.

  abstract  = {In the context of digital transformation, Total Supply Chain Management (TSCM) has emerged as an integrative approach that extends beyond traditional supply chain management paradigms to address the complexities of today's global markets. This study introduces the CSISO (Co-opetition, Strategy, Innovation, Social Responsibility, and Operations) model, a novel conceptual framework that uses traditional Chinese cultural symbols to illustrate the multifaceted nature of TSCM. The CSISO model leverages the symbolic elements of Chinese opera masks—ears, eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth—to represent core dimensions of supply chain management. This integration of cultural symbols provides a unique and intuitive tool that enhances both the academic understanding and the practical application of supply chain strategies. Employing a multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral, and multilevel approach, TSCM facilitates the seamless integration of various supply chain components, encompassing competition and cooperation, strategic planning, technological innovation, social responsibility, and operational efficiency. The application of cultural symbols within the CSISO model not only enriches the theoretical framework of supply chain integration but also offers practical managerial implications. Managers can use the CSISO model to better communicate and implement comprehensive, culturally informed supply chain strategies, thereby fostering enhanced collaboration, innovation, and sustainability within their organizations. This study makes several contributions: it offers a comprehensive framework that aligns with contemporary supply chain needs by integrating cultural insights with modern management practices; and it extends the theoretical foundation of supply chain integration by incorporating the latest advancements in technology and organizational behavior. The findings suggest that adopting a TSCM approach not only improves efficiency and effectiveness but also fosters sustainable and resilient supply chains in a rapidly evolving global environment. By embedding cultural dimensions into supply chain management, the CSISO model provides a novel perspective that enhances strategic decision-making and operational practices, ultimately driving overall business performance.},

Supported in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) through the incorporation of subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude towards behavior, driving the intentions to behave ecologically, this research presents an extended framework by incorporating two additional constructs, environmental consciousness and external influences in moderation and mediation roles, respectively, to predict consumers’ leasing intentions. By using the data from 1,026 home owners in Ecuador and through partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM), the findings reveal that attitude towards behavior (β = 0.492, p  < 0.001) and subjective norms (β = 0.347, p  < 0.001) are the most important drivers of intentions to behave ecologically, explaining almost 68},

  abstract  = {The generative adversarial network (GAN) is a milestone technique in artificial intelligence, and it is widely used in image generation. However, it has a large hyper-parameter space, which makes it difficult for training. In this work, we propose a new generative model by introducing the supporting vector machine into the GAN architecture. Such modification reduces the hyper-parameter space by half, thus making the training more accessible. The formic acid dimer (FAD) system is studied to examine the generation capacity of the proposed model. The molecular structures, molecular energies and molecular dipole moments are combined as the feature vector to train the model. It is found that the proposed model can generate new feature vectors from scratch, and the generated data agrees well with the ab initio values. In addition, each generated feature vector is unique, so the mode collapse problem is avoided, which is often encountered in the GAN model. The proposed model is extensible to incorporate any molecular properties as the feature vector is established as the direct sum of corresponding component vectors; thus, it is expected that the proposed method will have a wide range of application scenarios. Scientific contribution statement: A generative adversarial algorithm combing supporting vector machine is proposed for the first time to predict molecular properties from scratch, which agrees well with ab initio values. The new model is more efficient than generative adversarial networks, and it is convenient to extend for application in different scenarios.},

Recent work has focused on dynamically changing traffic characteristics but has paid less attention to the global cross-spatial-temporal domain of modeling, which may limit their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play fusion unit to accurately express the spatial-temporal dependencies by cross-domain complementary information integration, named the Cross-Domain Transformer Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network (CDTSTFN). By introducing two-stage fusion units, we compensate information loss and resolve the mismatch in fused information. This enables CDTSTFN to largely augment the base spatial-temporal predictors with learned both local-global spatial and short-long temporal dependencies on cross-domain spatial-temporal patterns. A comprehensive set of both quantitative and qualitative assessments is performed on six public traffic network datasets (PeMS03, PeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, METR-LA, and PeMS-BAY), demonstrating the superior performance of our model.},

  abstract  = {Background and Objectives Nedosiran (Rivfloza^®) is an RNA interference (RNAi) therapy approved for individuals aged ≥ 2 years with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder causing renal failure and systemic oxalosis. Nedosiran silences lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) mRNA in hepatocytes, reducing oxalate levels. This study evaluated the model-informed clinical development of nedosiran to support proposed doses in children aged 2 to < 12 years with PH1. Methods A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (Pop-PK/PD) model characterizing the plasma concentration-time profile of nedosiran and its effect on the spot urine oxalate-to-creatinine ratio (Uox/Cr) was developed using data from six trials. Simulations assessed spot Uox/Cr reduction in children aged 2 to < 12 years for the proposed dosing regimen versus those aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 50 kg with similar renal function. Results The datasets included 2087 PK ( N = 148) and 668 spot Uox/Cr ( N = 41, with PH1) observations. Body weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and PH type were covariates in the PK model, with body weight in low and high percentiles affecting nedosiran exposures. Moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m^2) increased exposure, while only age was significant for baseline Uox/Cr in the PD model. Simulations showed similar Uox/Cr reduction and times to maximum effect in children aged 2 to < 12 years, treated once-monthly (Q1M) with 3.5 mg/kg, compared to those aged ≥ 12 years treated Q1M with 170 mg. Conclusions Simulations based on the final Pop-PK/PD model support the 3.5 mg/kg Q1M dosing regimen in children aged 2 to < 12 years with PH1 and relatively intact kidney function (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m^2).

  abstract  = {Engineering machines exhibit abundant low-frequency vibrations (about 10Hz), which can offer the energy for movement of passive vibration-driven robotics. However, applications of this kind of robots are limited since they have trouble reacting effectively to these low-frequency vibrations. Therefore, this study proposes a passive vibration-driven robot with a magnetic bistable nonlinear energy sink (MBNES) to improve its ability to respond to low frequency vibration. Dynamic model of the robot is established, and numerical simulations are employed to explore the system’s bistable structure, dynamic response and basin of attraction. The results demonstrate that inter-well oscillation not only enhances the robot’s locomotion speed compared to intra-well patterns, but more importantly, lowers the threshold frequency required for effective motion. Furthermore, a robot prototype is built and experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results. During the experiments, the prototype’s maximum average velocities are 4.2 cm/s forward and 1.2 cm/s backward at vibration frequencies between 11 and 17 Hz. The required vibration frequency to produce the same velocities is around 30},

  abstract  = {Authenticating digital images is increasingly challenging due to the prevalence of tampering techniques such as copy-move tampering, where parts of an image are copied and pasted within the same image. This tampering is often disguised using geometric transformations like rotation and scaling, and further concealed by techniques such as JPEG compression and AWGN. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for copy-move tampering detection that leverages the SURF detector and BRISK descriptor. The SURF detector is known for its speed and stability, even in rotated images, and when combined with BRISK, it significantly improves the F1-Score compared to existing approaches. Our approach employs hierarchical clustering and neighborhood search to accurately identify and locate tampered regions, even in images that have undergone post-processing techniques such as geometric transformations, combined attacks, and multiple instances of copy-move tampering. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing keypoint-based approaches, particularly in scenarios where images have been subjected to complex manipulations like rotation, scaling, AWGN, and JPEG compression. Furthermore, considering execution time, our approach holds promise for real-time copy-move tampering detection and image authentication applications. This improvement in both detection accuracy and speed makes our approach a valuable contribution to the field of digital image forensics.},

  abstract  = {As a key component of magnetorheological polishing equipment, the reliability of peristaltic pump hose directly restricts the effective operation of the whole equipment. Unfortunately, the hose has many failure modes in actual engineering, including fatigue, wear, tear and burst blasting. Meanwhile, these failure modes often have high correlation, which brings great challenges to the reliability analysis of magnetorheological polishing equipment. For that reason, this paper proposes an active learning reliability analysis method combining multiple response Gaussian process (MRGP) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to deal with the correlation between failure modes. Herein, MRGP model is used to describe the correlation between failure modes of peristaltic pump hose, and a surrogate model of limit state functions of hose is correspondingly constructed. Combined with active learning strategy, the MRGP surrogate model of hose is updated iteratively until the convergence is satisfied. On this basis, the reliability of the peristaltic pump hose is analyzed by MCS. Finally, a numerical example is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method which is further applied into the reliability analysis of the peristaltic pump hose.},

  abstract  = {It is critical to apply wafer-level underfill (WLUF) to establish and improve the stability of microbumps. Although applying WLUF to microbump interconnection layers is common, understanding the behavior of microbump stability without WLUF protection is also critical. Electromigration (EM) and thermal cycling (T/C) tests were performed at a current density of 1.3 × 10^5 A/cm^2 at 150℃ and − 45 to 125℃, respectively, to investigate the effect of a WLUF on the reliability for mixed loading of EM and T/C in Cu/Ni/Sn-Ag microbumps. The results of the mixed loading tests showed different failure modes for microbumps with and without the WLUF. Microbump test samples without the WLUF exhibited horizontal cracks. On the other hand, the test samples with WLUF showed cracks propagating obliquely. A series of finite element analyses revealed that the WLUF caused vertical deformation and led to an increase in tensile stress, resulting in oblique crack propagation. These results suggest that the WLUF, due to its relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, undergoes vertical expansion during thermal cycling, which introduces vertical tensile strain into the microbump structure. As a result, it functions as a stress redistribution layer that modifies the internal stress profile. This redistribution alters the crack propagation path and enhances the mechanical reliability of microbump interconnects under mixed EM and T/C loading. Graphical Abstract },

The thinning limits are found to be different at VWACF and VWAPF due to the stress triaxiality factor. The experimental part thicknesses are compared with theoretical relations.

  abstract  = {Underwater images often suffer from degradation due to light absorption and scattering, leading to issues such as blurriness, low contrast, and color distortion. To address these challenges, we advance the dark channel low-rank prior theory for the first time and propose a novel single underwater image restoration method based on it. Our method, called DCLR, comprises four key steps: color correction preprocessing, transmission estimation through matrix completion, water light estimation using image segmentation, and scene radiance recovery. By leveraging the low-rank nature of dark channels, DCLR enhances transmission estimation accuracy without relying on soft matting or guided filters, thereby improving descattering capabilities. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DCLR effectively improves color deviations and significantly enhances underwater image restoration outcomes. The source code and datasets will be available at: https://github.com/WYUlin16/WYUlin (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.13825112) .},

  abstract  = {This paper describes the development and application of an analytical solution to assist with inpatient flow and capacity management at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City. We present a discrete-event simulation model that captures several key aspects of the complex patient flow patterns at MSKCC in the inpatient setting. The model captures the variation in admission patterns based on various patient cohorts and admit locations. The model also accounts for the variability in specialized care needs for distinct patient cohorts using categorical distributions. Durations for various patient flow states from admission till discharge are modeled as probability distributions. Key patient-and resource attributes are also incorporated to accurately capture the constraints affecting resource allocation. A comprehensive set of output metrics is used to validate the model, and to compare alternative scenarios. We present results for a scenario that tests the impact of resource allocation changes aimed at consolidating patients on certain floors based on the hospital department tasked with their inpatient care. Outputs for the scenario are compared with baseline using the following output metrics: mean bed utilization by floor, mean admit boarding times by service, proportion of home floor admissions by service, and wait times for step-down care beds. Our results show an estimated reduction in average admit wait times by 30 minutes or more across 4 inpatient services (an annual reduction of 
$$\sim $$
 ∼ 116 days), with a neutral impact on other output metrics. The analysis from the scenario was utilized by hospital leadership to implement actual bed allocation changes in the hospital. The model demonstrates a structured analytical approach to evaluate the impact of strategic or tactical changes prior to implementing them in practice, specifically in an inpatient setting. It also provides the flexibility to design and test a wide variety of scenarios, and has proved its utility as a decision support tool that can be leveraged periodically by leadership at MSKCC.},

  abstract  = {This study investigated the long-term changes in the total column ozone (TCO) over Nigeria using measurements retrieved from the ozone (O3) multi-sensor reanalysis (MSR). It assessed the spatial variability of TCO in Dobson Unit (DU), its monthly distribution, and interannual variability, and identified trends at these time scales over three decades (1981–2010) using the Sen’s slope estimator. The results of these analyses reveal that over the study area, the O3 maximum and minimum concentrations are 248 DU and 268 DU, respectively, producing an average range of about 255 DU. During the dry season, TCO values were found to be less than 250 DU across the country but greater than 250 DU during the wet season. Furthermore, the interannual O3 characteristics uncover dynamic oscillating features, which can be attributed to the influence of a combination of many atmospheric processes, e.g., the wind pattern and stratospheric intrusion. The contribution of sunspot number, Southern Oscillation Index, and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) at 10 hPa and 30 hPa to TCO values across Nigeria was also investigated. QBO at 10 and 30 hPa showed statistically significant correlation values with TCO over the region.},

Fundamental research illuminates our understanding of tumor behavior and identifies valuable therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the exploration of fundamental theories and the validation of clinical therapies hinge on preclinical experiments. Preclinical models, in this context, serve as the conduit connecting fundamental theories to clinical outcomes. In vivo models established in animals offer a valuable platform for comprehensively observing interactions between tumor cells and organisms. Using various experimental animals, including mice, diverse methods, such as carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis, tumor cell line or human tumor transplantation, genetic engineering, and humanization, have been used effectively to construct numerous models for tumor LNM. Carcinogen-induced models simulate the entire process of tumorigenesis and metastasis. Transplantation models, using human tumor cell lines or patient-derived tumors, offer a research platform closely mirroring the histology and clinical behavior of human tumors. Genetically engineered models have been used to delve into the mechanisms of primary tumorigenesis within an intact microenvironment. Humanized models are used to overcome barriers between human and murine immune systems. Beyond mouse models, various other animal models have unique advantages and limitations, all contributing to exploring LNM. This review summarizes existing in vitro and animal preclinical models, identifies current bottlenecks in preclinical research, and offers an outlook on forthcoming preclinical models.},

  abstract  = {This article presents an innovative method for the efficient capture of the Pareto front in the context of multiobjective optimization applied to mechanical design, specifically for a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine. The primary objective is to develop an approach that overcomes the limitations of existing methods in terms of convergence, solution diversity, and constraint management. The data comes from a case study on the design of a CNC machine, involving several conflicting criteria such as manufacturing cost, structural rigidity, and cutting performance. To achieve this goal, the article employs a method based on a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, combining advanced constraint handling techniques and metamodels to optimize performance. The results demonstrate that the new method is capable of generating a diverse set of non-dominated solutions, thereby representing a well-defined Pareto front. This approach offers significant implications for the mechanical industry, particularly in supporting decision-making, accelerating design processes, and fostering innovation. In conclusion, the article recommends the adoption of this method in other mechanical design contexts to enhance the efficiency and relevance of proposed solutions, while also opening new research perspectives for further optimization of multiobjective processes.},

  abstract  = {A comprehensive high-speed train control system is essential for reliable and efficient train operation. A global switching control strategy is introduced to address cooperative control challenges under high speeds and complex communication conditions. To enhance speed tracking stability and convergence under normal communication, a super-twisting sliding mode controller and a fast terminal sliding mode controller are combined. An improved distributed cooperative fault-tolerant control method based on the TACS communication system is introduced to maintain safe distances and speeds between trains when train-ground communication is disrupted. Accurate control of train spacing is achieved by adjusting the potential energy coefficient and coefficient of information. To prevent swaying and coupler wear caused by carriage coupling, a coupler safety constraint controller is proposed. This controller applies segmented constraints on speed and position errors between car bodies to ensure safe coupler operation. The coordinated switching control scheme integrates single-point and multi-particle control methods, refined for varying train dynamics and communication states. The effectiveness of the control scheme is validated through simulations with actual high-speed train operational data.},

  abstract  = {Image generation systems often lack understanding of textual descriptions, resulting in generated images with missing context-specific details. In this research work, a novel method of image generation from text using image diffusion models has been proposed. The system uses a fine-tuned Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) model to learn the relationship between image-text pairs by extracting image and text features from the training dataset. The extracted features are used for end-to-end training of Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) model, which consists of an encoder, quantizer and decoder. The encoder encodes the features, and reduces them to a lower dimensional shared-latent space, which is quantized and mapped by the quantizer according to the codebook and fed into the PixelSNAIL model in order to predict the pixels. The decoder takes the predicted pixels as input in order to generate semantically-preserved and visually realistic images. The system achieved a Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) score of 0.124 for the generated images when trained using the MediaEval MUSTI dataset and a LPIPS score of 0.122 when trained with COCO dataset (Car images where taken). The system is further evaluated by generating text captions for the generated images, obtaining a BLEU scores of 0.47138 and 0.52241 and ROUGE-1 scores of 0.4312 and 0.5012 for both datasets respectively.},

  month     = {jun},
  abstract  = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with emotional memory deficits, but treatment is limited by a poor understanding of the mechanisms that drive such behavior. Our previous work linked depression to a negative retrieval bias rooted in abnormal evidence accumulation (Cataldo et al. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General , 152 (1), 139, 2023 ). The drift diffusion model can account for this bias in two ways: increased familiarity, in which depression strengthens evidence for all negative memories—even false ones—or motivated retrieval, in which depression increases the propensity to judge negative items as “old”—even if they are weak. Thus, it is unclear whether depression affects the quality of negative memories or the way they are acted upon. The current work distinguishes these accounts via the Parceling Recognition Into Strength and Motivation (PRISM) task, which isolates memory from decision processes by extending single-item recognition to forced choices between targets and lures (Starns et al. Cognitive Psychology , 102 , 21–40, 2018 ). Though motivation to respond “old” can bias single-item judgments, it should play little or no role when judging which item is old; thus, familiarity is implicated when valence effects extend across both tasks, and motivation is implicated when they do not. In a sample of 53 adults ranging in depressive severity, we found that the negative retrieval bias extended across single-item and forced-choice recognition, thus supporting false familiarity. A qualitative analysis of participants’ self-reported strategies further indicated that increased schema use may be an important mechanism. In sum, we provide critical evidence that the negative retrieval bias in depressed adults results from disrupted memory representations.},

  abstract  = {Historically and socially, English has progressively solidified its role as the primary language of scientific communication. However, a distinction exists between the academic English employed in scientific discourse and the everyday English used in daily interactions. While most researchers who speak English as a second language receive lifelong training in the language, the issue of English acting as a barrier to scientific research remains underexplored and warrants further investigation. Utilizing bibliometric analysis, this study examines the research landscape concerning the impact of English proficiency on scientific and technological advancement. It investigates the current state of research, key research hotspots, and emerging trends in this field. Additionally, the paper explores the interplay between language proficiency and scientific-technological progress, using marine engineering as a case study. The analysis reveals that current research on academic English predominantly focuses on educational and classroom settings, with insufficient attention paid to real-world scientific research contexts. Furthermore, it highlights that the dominance of English in science compels L2 speakers to depend heavily on the language for technological progress, yet linguistic barriers may result in inaccurate knowledge acquisition and impede development. This study represents an interdisciplinary fusion of engineering with fields like linguistics and education. By offering insights into mitigating language-related challenges, this study aims to enhance global scientific collaboration and support the achievement of sustainable development goals.},

  abstract  = {Background Meningiomas exhibit significant tumor heterogeneity leading to diverse prognosis of patients. While DNA methylation (DNAme)-based classification has shown good performance in subtyping of meningiomas, single-cell transcriptomics offer an opportunity to further explore cell population activity. Understanding the functional states of macrophage populations is especially critical in meningiomas, given their established roles in tumor progression and therapeutic response. Methods We performed integrated multi-omics clustering of DNAme and bulk RNA-seq data from 302 paired meningioma samples. This identified molecular types characterized by distinct survival, copy number variation (CNV), immune infiltration, and pathway enrichment profiles. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) validated CNV findings and enabled deconvolution of type-specific macrophage populations using SCISSOR, while scRank assessed candidate genes to identify therapeutic targets. Results We identified five meningioma molecular types (CS1-CS5) with distinct recurrence risks, survival, CNV landscapes, and immune microenvironments: Proliferative (CS1), Metabolic (CS2), Mixed (CS3), Immune-Enriched (CS4), and NF2-Wild-Type (CS5). CS4 was featured by high macrophage infiltration, while CS5 showed immune-desert characteristics. Type-specific CNV profiles showed chromosome 22 deletions relating to immune infiltration, and SPP1 -centered gene networks highlighted its regulatory role in macrophage plasticity. Particularly, SPP1 upregulation associated with poor prognosis in CS1 and downregulation likely contributed to better outcomes in CS4. Drug sensitivity analyses identified the potential of targeting SPP1 for macrophage reprogramming in future type-directed therapies. Conclusion Our meningioma prognostic stratification characterized macrophage functional heterogeneity and CNV-driven immune microenvironment disparities. We found SPP1 as a critical regulator for macrophage function and offering a promising candidate for future treatment to target in an aggressive molecular type.},

Due to the effort of manually discovering trace links and the variety of software artefacts, trace link discovery tools have been proposed. Among these is OntoTraceV2.0, an ontology-based automatic reasoning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool for trace link discovery. In this paper, we evaluate how OntoTraceV2.0 affects subjects’ efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction during trace link discovery. We conducted three quasi-experiments with 70 subjects in total. We asked subjects to discover trace links between a set of semi-structured software requirements in natural language—i.e., user stories—and a conceptual model—i.e., existence dependency graphs (EDGs)—with the support of OntoTraceV2.0 and without tool support. OntoTraceV2.0 increased subjects’ median precision compared to manual trace link discovery, with an average recall decrease of 7},

  month     = {jun},
  abstract  = {Multi-fidelity surrogate models based on Gaussian processes are widely utilized in engineering and optimization due to their ability to quantify uncertainty. The majority of current multi-fidelity Gaussian process models are constructed using stationary kernel functions, which assume that the fluctuations of the response surface remain consistent across the input space. However, this assumption of stationarity is frequently violated when the response surface exhibits complex variations, leading to an inaccurate representation surface. This paper proposes a non-stationary multi-fidelity surrogate modeling method incorporating sequential sampling, designed to improve the performance of surrogate models for non-stationary systems. In this method, a closed-form distance warping mapping is introduced to transform the non-stationary system into an approximately stationary one by leveraging multi-fidelity samples. Meanwhile, the structure of the distance warping mapping is determined through density clustering on the samples to reduce the complexity of solving the multi-fidelity surrogate model. Through six analytical functions and the breakdown voltage prediction of the SiC-MOSFET device, the superiority of the proposed method is indicated from the aspects of modeling accuracy and suitability for sequential criteria. Experimental results further show that the proposed method improves the performance of sequential sampling to a certain extent due to the correct evaluation of prediction uncertainty.},

RADRC was optimized using a Particle Swarm-Difference Evolutionary (PSO-DE) hybrid intelligent optimization algorithm with good global convergence and low computational effort. Nonlinear friction, mutual torque interference and unmodeled dynamics of gimbal motors are the main influencing factors for attitude stabilization of gimballed vibrationless cameras. These are considered as “total disturbances,” estimated by a Reduced Extended State Observer (RESO), and compensated in real time. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations and experiments are carried out.

  abstract  = {Entrepreneurship is essential for boosting economic growth, fostering innovation, and providing employment in emerging countries like Pakistan, where the middle class is still growing. Pakistan's entrepreneurship ecosystem has immense potential but faces significant challenges. The study examines the dynamics of entrepreneurship in Pakistan, identifying and addressing entrepreneur motivations essential to creating policies that stimulate new company startups and growth. The study explores how the regulatory environment, education, innovation investment, capital availability, and infrastructure development affected Pakistan's entrepreneurship from 1996Q1 to 2023Q4. The study uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model to detect short-term and long-term correlations in time-series data. Granger causality investigations examine how these traits affect entrepreneurship. Finally, the study examined the determinants' inter-temporal connections to determine their impact on entrepreneurship in the coming decade. The short-term results suggest that regulatory quality, research and development investment, and financial availability boost entrepreneurial activity. In contrast, meager income growth and inadequate education hinder entrepreneurship. Sustained investment fosters entrepreneurship, while low educational levels, limited infrastructure, and slow economic growth remain long-term barriers. Granger causality tests show that entrepreneurship and wealth development impact regulatory quality. Infrastructure improvements stimulate research and development expenditures, and the regulatory environment enhances education. Capital availability and educational attainment fuel research and development and infrastructure progress. The inter-temporal analysis predicts that the regulatory environment will have the greatest variation shock on entrepreneurial activity in the next decade, followed by education, finance, economic growth, industrial development, and research and development investment. The study concludes that concentrated reforms in education, infrastructure, financing, and regulation may boost entrepreneurial growth in the short and long term.},

  abstract  = {Active contour model (ACM) is a pivotal approach for image segmentation. However, conventional models are susceptible to noise and weak target boundaries, limiting their practical applications. Furthermore, uncertainty in the initial contour heightens model sensitivity. To address these challenges, we introduce DoG   EED, an active contour model grounded in the anisotropic diffusion equation and Gaussian convolution. The proposed anisotropic diffusion equation, termed EED, enhances noise robustness and edge localization by strengthening gradients along target boundaries while weakening them in noisy regions. Leveraging Gaussian kernel functions, we construct a streamlined energy function, the DoG operator, which efficiently captures essential image information while mitigating model complexity. A novel regularization function, independent of the global energy function, preserves its effectiveness while reducing iteration costs. By integrating YOLOv5 bounding boxes with DoG   EED, we mitigate initial contour sensitivity. Extensive experiments validate that DoG   EED boasts robust anti-noise capabilities and maintains high segmentation accuracy, achieving 81.2 DSI, 76.9 SI, and 78.4 JI in homogeneous experiments, along with 79.3 mIoU, 46.5

  abstract  = {Atmospheric methane is rapidly increasing, and the role of tropical wetlands in the global methane budget raises concerns about a potential climate-wetland-methane feedback. Here we use Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System observations to map monthly inundation dynamics across the tropics (37.4°S to 37.4°N) at high resolution (0.01° × 0.01°) over five years (2018–2023), including cloud and vegetation-covered regions. Our results reveal large seasonal and interannual variations in wetland extent not captured in traditional inundation products, with strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation correlations. Tropical wetland models driven by these inundation observations, independent precipitation products, or constrained by total water observations do not show growth in wetland methane emissions from 2020–2022. This suggests the 2020–2022 growth in methane is best explained by other methane source or sink mechanisms, or that non-hydrological controls are more important in tropical wetland methane emissions than currently understood. The strong increase in global methane from 2020-2022 was not powered by precipitation and inundation increasing wetland emissions in tropical regions, according to analysis of satellite observations of tropical inundation, 2018-2023.},

  abstract  = {A novel parameter identification method for magnetic levitation bearing rotor systems is proposed, based on the modulation function method. The fundamental principle of the modulation function method for parameter identification is derived on the basis of the characteristics of the modulation function. The transformation of the differential equation model of a continuous system into a general algebraic equation model is effectively achieved, thereby avoiding the influence of errors introduced by the initial value and differential derivation of the system. Modulation function method parameter identification models have been established for single-degree-of-freedom and multi-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation bearing rotor systems. The influence of different parameters of Hartley modulation function on the accuracy of system parameter identification has been investigated, thus providing a basis for the design of Hartley modulation function parameters. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the modulation function method can effectively identify system parameters despite the presence of system noise.},

A better understanding of the fracture of these materials, both theoretically and experimentally, is required to deploy them in structural applications. This study focuses on the measurement of stress intensity factors (SIFs) around a sharp kink using digital image correlation (DIC). The performances of two DIC-based techniques, namely, integrated-DIC and post-processing of DIC-measured displacement fields, are assessed on a benchmark test using fused deposit modeling capabilities, and are compared to a reference finite element solution. It is shown that Williams’ expansion remains valid on a large enough region around the crack to extract reliable SIFs even very close to the crack kink. Both techniques are very trustworthy, provided the SIF identification zone is carefully defined to exclude the kink zone of influence.},

  abstract  = {Background In recent years, Taiwan’s medical education has increasingly emphasized simulated learning, particularly through advanced manikins designed for procedural training, including endotracheal intubation. Although key indicators and predictive techniques for assessing complexity have been documented, their use in evaluating these manikins remains notably lacking.The aim of this study was to appraise the potential association between our devised scoring system and the actual outcome of intubation procedures. Subsequently, this scoring system could potentially serve as an objective yardstick for quantifying the intricacy of training simulators. Methods Nineteen post-graduate or emergency medicine trainees participated in this study. Intubation training involved four manikins, each with varying difficulty scores based on neck circumference, thyromental distance, airway obstruction, and Mallampati grade 3/4. Training modules included standard, advanced, and small adult intubation. Independent variables were training models and operator skill levels, while dependent variables included intubation time, success rate, tooth injury, gastric insufflation, uninflated cuff mishaps, perceived difficulty (rated 1–5), and laryngoscopy view quality (rated 1–4). Results and discussion Intubation parameters were recorded for comparison across subgroups. Mean intubation times for models A, B, and D were 42.67 ± 15.32 seconds , 48.73 ± 17.54 seconds , and 50.22 ± 18.40 seconds , with success rates of 89.47},

  abstract  = {Selecting the right tree species is a crucial step in designing sustainable and effective agroforestry systems. To support this process, several decision support systems (DSS) have been developed in various countries to help farmers and advisors choose appropriate species. However, these tools are often limited in reach—typically used only within the country where they were created—and tend to focus on different aspects of adaptation to local conditions or achieving specific farming objectives. In this context, we introduce a new framework for agroforestry tree species selection. Its goals are twofold: (i) to compile and organize the knowledge embedded in existing tree selection tools, and (ii) to offer an intuitive, user-friendly graphical interface—AgroforesTreeAdvice. This tool allows users to input local parameters such as soil type, climate, biotic factors, and farm-level or socio-economic constraints, alongside production goals (e.g., timber, fruits) and ecosystem service objectives (e.g., soil conservation, carbon storage). The unified system successfully integrates eight existing agroforestry DSS, improving their (i) findability by centralizing them in one location, (ii) accessibility through a standardized and user-friendly interface, (iii) interoperability by enabling API-based queries across all tools, and (iv) reusability for future DSS development. Finally, we present early user feedback from pilot deployments in three countries, highlighting the tool’s benefits and outlining next steps toward further harmonization of agroforestry databases.},

We demonstrate that ccRCCs in the Vhl/Trp53/Rb1 mutant mouse model are resistant to combined anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 therapy alone and in combination with additional therapeutic agents that reflect current ccRCC clinical trials. However, in some animals in vivo checkpoint therapy allowed isolated splenic T cells to recognise cultured ccRCC cells from the same animal, implicating the tumour microenvironment in suppression of T cell activation. We identified putative immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations with features similar to myeloid cells in the microenvironment of human ccRCC. The expression patterns of immune checkpoint ligands in both the mouse model and in human ccRCC suggests that several checkpoint systems other than PD-1 and CTLA-4 are likely to represent the dominant T cell suppressive forces in ccRCC. Our findings characterise an autochthonous mouse ccRCC model of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy resistance and pave the way for a systematic functional dissection of the identified potential molecular barriers to effective immune therapy of ccRCC.},

  abstract  = {Infrared small target detection plays an important role in infrared search and tracking applications. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been introduced to this task with remarkable results. However, the current method is limited by reasons such as network structure and feature extraction capability, which makes it difficult to complete the detection of deep infrared small targets and infrared small targets in complex backgrounds. To address the above problems, this paper proposes attention-guided dual feature extraction infrared small target detection network, which consists of two levels of feature extraction, a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism and a contextual feature extraction mechanism, respectively. The multi-scale feature extraction mechanism implements the feature extraction operation of the first layer, and by fusing and splicing the features of different layers, the information interaction between neighboring layers is achieved, which can effectively prevent the loss of small targets in the deep layer. Among them, the target attention mechanism enhances the model’s attention to small targets and provides effective attention allocation for the detection of small infrared targets. And the multi-resolution feature interaction mechanism can better preserve the detail information of the image and enhance the model’s ability to perceive small targets. The contextual feature extraction mechanism implements the second-level feature extraction operation, which is able to accurately locate the position of small targets in complex background environments by effectively integrating global semantics and local semantics. The experimental results show that the method in this paper achieves 99.81},

  abstract  = {Remodelling of cancellous bone due to the combined activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the cellular scale has notable repercussions both at the meso (tissue) as well as the macro (organ) scale. At the meso scale, trabeculae adapt their geometry, typically in terms of their cross section, whereas the nominal bone density evolves at the macro scale, all in response to habitual mechanical loading and its perturbations. To capture this intricate scale coupling, we here propose a novel conceptual three-scale approach to the remodelling of cancellous bone. Therein, we combine a detailed bone cell population model at the cellular scale with an idealised trabecular truss network model with adaptive cross sections, that are driven by the cell population model, at the meso scale, which is eventually upscaled to a continuum bone density adaption model at the macro scale. Algorithmically, we solve the meso and macro problems concurrently within a finite element setting and update the cell activity in a staggered fashion. Our benchmark simulations demonstrate the applicability and effectivity of the three-scale approach to analyse bone remodelling in health and disease (here exemplified for the example of osteoporosis) with rich details, e.g. evolving anisotropy, resolved at each scale.},

  abstract  = {The degradation of permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to persist and potentially worsen as the climate continues to warm. Thawing permafrost results in the decomposition of organic matter frozen in the ground, which stores large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC), leading to carbon being emitted into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane. This process could potentially contribute to positive feedback between global climate change and permafrost carbon emissions. Accurate projections of permafrost thawing are key to improving our estimates of the global carbon budget and future climate change. Using data from the latest generation of climate models (CMIP6), this paper explores the challenges involved in assessing the annual active layer thickness (ALT), defined as the maximum annual thaw depth of permafrost, and estimated carbon released under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). We find that the ALT estimates derived from CMIP6 model soil temperatures show significant deviations from the observed ALT values. This could lead to inconsistent estimates of carbon release under climate change. We propose a simplified approach to improve the estimate of the changes in ALT under future climate projections. These predicted ALT changes, combined with present-day observations, are used to estimate vulnerable carbon under future climate projections. CMIP6 models project ALT changes of 0.1–0.3 m per degree rise in local temperature, resulting in an average deepening of approx. 1.2–2.1 m in the northern high latitudes under different scenarios. With increasing temperatures, permafrost thawing starts in Southern Siberia, Northern Canada, and Alaska, progressively extending towards the North Pole by the end of the century under high emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5). Using projections of ALT changes and vertically resolved SOC data, we estimate the ensemble mean of decomposable carbon stocks in thawed permafrost to be approximately 115 GtC (gigatons of carbon in the form of CO_2 and CH_4) under SSP1-2.6, 180 GtC under SSP2-4.5, 260 GtC under SSP3-7.0, and 300 GtC under SSP5-8.5 by the end of the century.},

  abstract  = {Purpose Workers face a notable risk of musculoskeletal injuries when performing squatting tasks. Knee exoskeletons offer a promising solution to mitigate muscle strain through squat assistance. However, existing studies on knee exoskeletons lack a comprehensive study that meets the multifaceted requirements of squatting assistance in terms of portability, efficiency, and muscle strain mitigation. Furthermore, another open research question pertains to the control strategy of squat assistance, which should be adaptable to various postures and cadences for different individuals. In particular, the effect of controlling negative power assistance during the squat-down phase is not studied. Methods To fill these two gaps, first, we develop a simple (computationally efficient and implementable in a microcontroller) and generalizable (for different postures, cadences, and individuals) torque controller for portable knee exoskeletons that delivers both negative and positive power. Our portable knee exoskeleton can benefit users by enhancing efficiency (reducing metabolic cost, heart rate, breathing ventilation), mitigating muscle strain (reducing EMG), and reducing perceived exertion (reducing Borg 6–20 scale) during squatting. Second, we study the effect of three levels of negative power assistance during the squat-down phase. Results This study integrates comprehensive biomechanics and physiology analyses that evaluate our exoskeleton's effectiveness using four objective and two subjective metrics with a group of able-bodied subjects ( n  = 7). The exoskeleton reduced metabolic cost by 12.8},

  abstract  = {Coastal archeological sites of high cultural heritage value are threatened by the effects of coastal flooding and erosion, due to extreme marine events, which are expected to intensify and become more frequent in the future. While climate change-induced inundation is often estimated by considering mean sea level rise and the intensification of extreme sea levels, the contribution of wave storms is frequently overlooked. The proposed approach considers coinciding and non-coinciding scenarios of mean sea level rise, extreme storm surge, tide, and extreme wave runup, and assesses the non-stationarity of all these variables, deriving thus the most essential drivers of coastal flooding in a changing climate. Moreover, through the use of global climatic scenarios, and coastal modeling, aims to produce detailed flooding maps for each examined scenario. This state-of-the-art methodology is incorporated into a novel climate-related risk assessment of coastal flooding based on the likelihood and consequence of a design flooding event, considering also site-specific aspects. The present study focuses on the coastal archaeological site of Delos, Greece—an island of exceptional archaeological significance but highly vulnerable to coastal inundation due to its low elevation and proximity to the sea. The coastal flooding risk is estimated in a high-resolution spatial analysis throughout the twenty-first century. The findings of the present analysis provide valuable insights into the natural hazard of coastal inundation at Delos, offering essential tools to protect coastal regions, and archaeological sites against flooding.},

Their ability to provide mathematically rigorous guarantees makes them invaluable for verifying critical properties like safety, reliability, and security. However, the increasing complexity of modern systems requires enhanced support for applying these techniques effectively in industrial context. Addressing these challenges demands that formal methods evolve to become more scalable, interoperable with industrial development workflows, and better supported by automation and user-friendly tools for developers and engineers. These advancements are essential to enable the broader and more systematic adoption of formal methods in the engineering of complex, real-world systems. In this introduction to the special issue, we highlight several recent advances in the application of formal methods for specifying and verifying safety-critical systems in various industrial domains.

  abstract  = {Climatic factors significantly influence travellers’ destination selection and demand for tourism products. To maintain sustainable tourism development, it is essential to monitor how tourist destinations will be affected by the projected future changes in the climate system. This study aims to reveal the future impact of climate change for tourism sector in Hungary using the Holiday Climate Index specified for urban tourism (HCI-Urban) and a modified version of Tourism Climate Index (mTCI). The paper employs an ensemble of multiple climate models (ALADIN5.2 and REMO2015) and emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to determine the future evolution of indices. Initially, the reference climatic conditions derived from the observational dataset CarpatClim-HU are presented. Then, the climate model results are validated against the observational database for both indices. Afterwards, bias-corrected model outputs are analysed for the periods 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 based on the ensemble of models and scenarios. The spatial distributions of indices are depicted on a monthly level and at a Hungarian district spatial scale. Both the observational and model results highlight that the climatic conditions are more favourable in spring and autumn compared to the summer months. It is also demonstrated that the climatic conditions in Hungary are expected to be more favourable or unchanged from autumn until spring, while there is a general worsening in summer. In terms of the future directions, larger uncertainties are found in May and September. Based on the anticipated trends, the paper pinpoints sector-specific recommendations for adapting tourism services to the altered climatic conditions.},

  abstract  = {A stabilized collocation method (SCM) employing reproducing kernel (RK) shape function is presented for solving the path-dependent nonlinear elastoplastic problems. Hencky’s theory of plastic deformation and von Mises yield criterion are dragged to construct the plastic models. The shape function utilized in SCM possesses high-order continuity and SCM can achieve exact subdomain integration through low-order quadrature, which ensures that this method attains high-order continuity in the solution. This is critical for obtaining high accuracy and optimal convergence when solving path-dependent nonlinear problems. Subdomain integration also reduces the condition number of the discrete matrix, further boosting the algorithm’s stability. The subdomains in SCM are located by the positions of particles, and domain deformation is illustrated by particle movement, which allows these subdomains to remain regular and undeformed. These characteristics make SCM a truly meshfree method. Effective parameters such as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and shear modulus functioning as outputs of the final state of the stress field can be obtained iteratively through the projection method applied to uniaxial material curves. Several two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical tests are examined, which show the high accuracy and good stability of SCM for elastoplastic analysis. All of these indications suggest that SCM holds immense potential for addressing material nonlinearity problems.},

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness. The pathogenesis of glaucoma is determined by different pathogenetic mechanisms, including increased intraocular pressure, mechanical stress, excitotoxicity, resistance to aqueous drainage and oxidative stress. Topical formulations are often used in glaucoma treatment, whereas surgical measures are used in acute glaucoma cases. For most patients, long-term glaucoma treatments are given. Poor patient compliance and low bioavailability are often associated with topical therapy, which suggests that sustained-release, long-acting drug delivery systems could be beneficial in managing glaucoma.

  abstract  = {In order to study the movement and deformation law of the super thick composite key layer overlying the stope. Taking the geological conditions of Yima mining area as the background, a three-dimensional (3.6 m × 2.0 m × 2.0 m) three-dimensional model was built for testing, and the deformation of overlying rock was monitored in real time by using distributed optical fiber, pressure sensor and multi-point displacement meter. The results show that the changes of the frequency shift peak value of the sensing fiber in value, position and shape reflect the dynamic evolution process of the bending deformation, fracture and rotation of the key strata in the overburden. When the working face advanced to 960 m, the 40 m thick fine sandstone (sub key layer I) broke four times and was in the collapse zone; The 160 m thick conglomerate (sub key layer II) of the lower formation was broken once, but the structure was not unstable and was in the fracture zone; The 250 m thick super thick conglomerate (the main key layer) of the upper formation has slight bending deformation and is located in the bending subsidence zone. The influence of mining causes the overlying high-level giant thick conglomerate to show two deformation characteristics: the giant thick conglomerate under the sub key layer forms a number of short-distance longitudinal non-through fractures, and the giant thick conglomerate above the main key layer forms a large non-through fracture bending deformation in the horizontal layer. With the increase of mining range, the composite key layer will appear synchronous and asynchronous fracture, and the rock layer will be suspended in a large area, which is easy to induce mine dynamic disasters.},

  abstract  = {X-ray imaging facilitates non-destructive testing of agricultural products; however, noise in the acquired images and the limitations of existing denoising methods hinder the full restoration of details in the presence of complex noise. To address the current challenges of high noise levels in walnut X-ray images and the difficulty in preserving critical image details after denoising, this study proposes an improved Restormer denoising model for clearer processing of walnut X-ray images. First, batch normalization layers were introduced into the Multi-Dconv Head Transposed Attention mechanism to enhance the model’s understanding of image features. Second, a vertical Total Variation loss function was integrated to suppress high noise levels and extract clearer image features. Experimental results show that the improved Restormer model achieves a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 37.30, a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.9358, and an information entropy of 6.5600, representing improvements of 0.16 dB, 0.0002, and 0.0014, respectively, compared to the original Restormer model. Additionally, the model’s computational complexity is reduced by 12.83 GFLOPs. In terms of PSNR, SSIM, information entropy, and visual quality, the proposed model outperforms DnCNN, U-NET, Uformer, MIRNET, DRUNET, and Restormer, providing clearer images with richer details. Furthermore, on the local dataset, the model also exhibited excellent processing performance, generalization ability, and stability, making it a highly effective solution for walnut X-ray image denoising. The research results can offer a theoretical basis for the efficient image denoising method on walnut X-ray and provide valuable insights for denoising research in other imaging fields.},

  abstract  = {The privatisation and the commercialisation of the space sector have enabled the implementation of space missions at reduced costs, allowing small companies and universities to develop and launch their own satellites such as CubeSats, PocketQubes, and ChipSats. While CubeSats are nowadays largely used, PocketQubes and ChipSats are still emerging as platforms for space missions. This paper details the mission, system, payload design, technology experiment, and challenges of the PocketQube for In-Orbit Technology Operations, or POQUITO. In particular, POQUITO is (1) the first PocketQube mission to host an independent ChipSat onboard, (2) the first mission to test the communication link between a PocketQube and a ChipSat in visible light, and (3) the first PocketQube mission to use magnetorquers directly printed in the inner layers of the internal stack PCBs and lateral panel PCBs. The 3-axis control using printed magnetorquers can successfully detumble the PocketQube from an angular velocity of 20  
$$^{\circ }$$
 ∘ /s in less than one orbital period, while saving volume and mass. Additionally, POQUITO adopts iterative design-development-test cycles for rapid spacecraft development and qualification, contrasting with the traditional phase-review methodology. The overall space system fits within a 5 cm edge cube and weighs 185g. Several challenges encountered in the development of the POQUITO mission, encompassing areas such as spacecraft development, launch opportunities, and non-technical matters as insurance coverage for pico-satellites are also detailed in the paper, providing useful guidelines for teams aiming to work in the sub-CubeSat area.},

  abstract  = {This work is to analyze the effects of massive and sudden environmental fluctuations and seasonal variation in the evolution of predator–prey species, which is modeled by a stochastic predator–prey model with Lévy noises and time-periodic coefficients. Firstly, the unique global positive solution of the model is established, and the stochastically ultimate boundedness of the solution is studied. Secondly, the threshold conditions for the time-average persistence in probability and extinction of the populations are derived by comparing the solution near the boundary and some stochastic estimates. Moreover, by using the properties of periodic Markov processes and Krylov–Bogolyubov’s method, we show that there exists a periodic measure in the model provided that it is time-average persistent in probability. To ensure the uniqueness of the periodic measure, the strong Feller property and irreducibility for the two-parameter Markov semigroup are proved under the non-degeneracy assumption. Finally, we give several examples and numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results and investigate the influences of small and large jump noises on the dynamics of the model.},

  abstract  = {Underwater image enhancement is crucial for underwater vision research. To address the problems of blurred details, color distortion, and low contrast in underwater images, this paper proposes a generative adversarial network-based underwater image enhancement algorithm (SER-GAN). The generator of SER-GAN is constructed by spatially enhanced residual modules (SERM), hierarchical attention-intensive aggregation module (HAAM), and feature enhanced bridging module (FEM). To solve the problem of color distortion, this paper designs a spatially enhanced residual block, which employs the overall spatial information to enhance the semantic feature learning in the key regions and uses the residual structure to promote the reuse of features to improve the accuracy of the color representation. In addressing low image contrast, this paper introduces a hierarchical attention dense aggregation module, which extracts image feature information at different scales and dynamically adjusts the weights of different regions through hierarchical attention, so that regions with low contrast receive more attention and enhancement. For the problem of detail blurring, this paper proposes the feature enhancement bridging block, which transforms the original feature space through an intermediate layer and can effectively extract and enhance the edge details and texture information while retaining the important information. Experiments have proved that the algorithm in this paper performs well in solving the problems of blurred details, color distortion, and low contrast in underwater images. The average optimization of image objective evaluation metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and UIQM on public datasets are 2.49},

  abstract  = {Coastal bridges play a vital role in supporting transportation and economic activities in coastal regions but are increasingly vulnerable to extreme wave events, exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. Traditional engineering solutions, such as seawalls and breakwaters, offer protection but are often expensive and environmentally disruptive. Vegetated coastlines, such as mangroves and salt marshes, have emerged as a sustainable alternative, capable of attenuating wave energy and providing natural protection. However, the mechanisms through which vegetation reduces wave impacts and its practical application to protect coastal bridges remain inadequately understood. This study addresses these gaps through laboratory experiments that investigate the attenuation effects of vegetation on extreme waves under varying initial wave states and vegetation densities. The experimental data are used to perform stochastic analyses to quantify bridge vulnerability under extreme wave scenarios, with and without vegetation protection. The paper presents the experimental design, methods for estimating wave-induced loads on bridge superstructures, and a probabilistic vulnerability model to assess bridge performance. Comparative results highlight the effectiveness of vegetation in mitigating wave loads and reducing bridge vulnerability. Findings from this study could contribute to advancing sustainable coastal protection strategies and provide critical insights for integrating vegetation-based solutions into coastal bridge design and management practices.},

  abstract  = {Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cells and matrix along the fibrotic trajectory in mouse lung identified PI16 as an anti-fibrotic factor with potential for therapeutic application in humans. Fibrosis, the replacement of healthy tissue with collagen-rich matrix, can occur following injury in almost every organ^ 1 , 2 . Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury^ 3 , and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched ‘ECM-secreting’ ( Csmd1 -expressing) and ‘pro-resolving’ ( Cd248 -expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial–transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution.},

  abstract  = {Interior thermal insulation has been widely used to improve energy efficiency and indoor comfort of historic buildings. However, traditional vapour-tight insulation materials strongly influence the hygrothermal behaviour of facades, which may lead to moisture-related problems. Capillary-active insulation aims to enhance moisture permeance, ensuring the hygrothermal response of the masonry wall is more aligned with that of an uninsulated wall. While some capillary-active systems have proven their efficiency, global climate change and extreme weather conditions introduce additional uncertainties. This study investigates this specific issue. The hygrothermal responses of three massive masonry walls — one with vapour-tight insulation, one with capillary-active insulation, and one uninsulated — are monitored and simulated under real climate conditions in Leuven, Belgium. The simulations, conducted in DELPHIN 6 with monitored climate datasets as boundary conditions, are validated using measured temperature and relative humidity. The validated model is subsequently used with one current and two future climate datasets to compare the impacts of vapour-tight and capillary-active insulation on the hygrothermal behaviours of the masonry walls under climate change. The former exhibited more serious moisture-related risks, offering only marginally better energy performance, while the latter showed a similar hygrothermal behaviour to the uninsulated wall. Exterior climates significantly influence hygrothermal responses: both insulation systems inevitably increase mould growth and frost damage risks, though moisture failures are reduced in warmer outdoor environments. This paper highlights the nuanced balance between energy efficiency and moisture safety for researchers and practitioners.},

Based on the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) concept, this paper takes remote sensing satellites as the research object, conducts top-down forward design, establishes a parametric model of system-subsystem-component, and embeds the mechanism relationship between parameters. By analyzing the System Modeling Language (SysML) parameter model, a parameter association tree is generated. The parameter association tree is further combined with the PageRank method to locate key parameters. Through the above methods, the association relationship between complex parameters of remote sensing satellites is constructed, and the parameter impact between indicators can be quantitatively analyzed, which provides an effective tool for satellite design. Case analysis shows that this method can effectively analyze important parameters in the satellite design process, which will aid in the evaluation and optimization of satellite parameters.},

The present research delves into how ISC can enhance decision-making in healthcare, smart towns, and environmental monitoring. Issues with interoperability, electricity intake, ecological resilience, and the worrying latency requirements of task-critical packages are many obstacles to easy integration. Our proposed mechanism, adaptive resource allocation and routing for integrated sensing (ARAR-IS), which uses new wireless technologies, attempts to clear up these problems by allocating and routing assets for incorporated sensing. ARAR-IS dynamically allocates sources and routes information considering the real global and network dynamics. Optimizing resource utilization, mitigating interference, and enhancing dependability in ISC systems are achieved using ARAR-IS, which leverages cognitive routing algorithms and software program-defined networking ideas. With ARAR-IS, various computer-aided engineering regions can benefit from customized remedy plans, far-off patient tracking, and real-time attempts to lessen pollution. These domains include healthcare, proper infrastructure, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. Thorough simulation-based assessments show that ARAR-IS is a pleasant alternative for ISC systems in many one-of-a-kind situations because of its high reliability, low-strength intake, excessive throughput, and low latency.},

This study investigates how self-disclosure chatbots—designed to share relevant experiences and thoughts—can enhance academic stress assessments by increasing student engagement, improving accuracy, and fostering deeper self-reflection. Two chatbot conditions were developed: a self-disclosure (SD) chatbot that used personal narratives to build empathy, and a non-self-disclosure (NSD) chatbot. In a randomized experiment with 50 university students, participants interacted with either the SD or NSD chatbot. Results showed that the SD chatbot elicited significantly higher engagement, as evidenced by longer session lengths (15.55 ± 5.92 min) and higher word counts (240 ± 114.02 words), compared to the NSD chatbot (11.31 ± 5.21 min; 162.38 ± 66.24 words). Assessment accuracy—evaluated by comparing results from the SISCO Inventory of Academic Stress with chatbot-generated evaluations—was slightly higher for the SD chatbot (0.936) than for the NSD chatbot (0.862), based on accuracy within a ± one-point deviation. Moreover, students who interacted with the SD chatbot reported deeper self-reflection and developed more actionable strategies for managing their stress. Overall, these findings illuminate the value of self-disclosure in chatbot-based assessments and highlight broader applications for addressing academic stress and mental health challenges in educational settings.},

  abstract  = {Elixir is a modern functional language known for its robustness and scalability. This language has seen a growing adoption by companies worldwide in the last 12 years. Despite this fact, and to the best of our knowledge, there are few works in the literature focused on studying refactoring strategies for code implemented with this language. In a preliminary and previous study, we conducted a systematic literature review to provide an initial list of refactorings for Elixir. Aiming to expand the results of this preliminary study, in this work we use a mixed methodology based on a broader systematic literature review, a grey literature review, and the mining of artifacts in GitHub repositories to prospect and document new refactorings for this language. As a result, we propose a comprehensive catalog of 82 refactorings, including 14 new ones specific to Elixir, 32 aimed at functional languages, 11 Erlang-specific transformations compatible with Elixir, and 25 traditional refactorings cataloged by Fowler, which are also compatible with Elixir code. We validated this catalog by surveying 144 experienced Elixir developers from 42 countries spanning all continents. In this survey, we assessed the levels of relevance and prevalence of each refactoring in the catalog. We show that 93},

Yet, creating personalized HBMs from a single image is a challenging task. This study addresses this challenge by providing a framework for HBM personalization, starting from a single image used to estimate the subject’s skin point cloud, the skeletal point cloud, and the relative positions of the skeletons. Personalized HBMs were created by morphing the baseline HBM accounting skin and skeleton point clouds using a point cloud registration–based mesh morphing method. Using this framework, eight personalized HBMs with various biological characteristics (e.g., sex, height, and weight) were created, with comparable element quality to the baseline HBM. The mean geometric errors of the personalized FEMs generated by the framework are less than 7 mm, which was found to be acceptable based on biomechanical response evaluations conducted in this study.

  abstract  = {Gamification serves various purposes. In the context of education, it can be used to create visually appealing and engaging activities for students. However, as experts have noted, simply gamifying the content of a class may not be enough to improve student learning. To develop an approach that would enable us to gamify both class content and instructional design, we started a new project. As our initial step, we consulted relevant literature. Drawing inspiration from our findings, we formulated a methodology named GamiClass. To assess its potential, we held a workshop where we taught university professors how to utilise it, seeking their input. Subsequently, with an enhanced version, we designed an undergraduate Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) course. Finally, we conducted a randomised, controlled trial making use of a third iteration of the methodology. The results indicate that both educators and students benefit from its implementation. In this paper, we present our findings, discuss the pros and cons of our integral approach to gamifying classes (i.e., gamifying both content and instructional design), and outline our future work aimed at consolidating its effectiveness.},

Here we show that tumor evolution can be reproducibly redirected to engineer therapeutic opportunity, regardless of the exact ensemble of pre-existing genetic heterogeneity. We develop a selection gene drive system that is stably introduced into cancer cells and is composed of two genes, or switches, that couple an inducible fitness advantage with a shared fitness cost. Using stochastic models of evolutionary dynamics, we identify the design criteria for selection gene drives. We then build prototypes that harness the selective pressure of multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and employ therapeutic mechanisms as diverse as prodrug catalysis and immune activity induction. We show that selection gene drives can eradicate diverse forms of genetic resistance in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that model-informed switch engagement effectively targets pre-existing resistance in mouse models of solid tumors. These results establish selection gene drives as a powerful framework for evolution-guided anticancer therapy. Selection gene drives re-engineer tumors to suppress drug resistance.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative assessment of landfill slope failure risk provides valuable information about slope design and risk reduction. This study presents a reliability-based analysis in which an accurate method is applied to assess slope failure risk using the stochastic finite difference method. This method incorporates the spatial variability of municipal solid waste properties due to anisotropic autocorrelation structures and evaluates the consequence associated with each failure separately. This method was evaluated using the data of the Saravan landfill (Rasht, Iran) and presenting a parametric analysis. Several Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to indicate the heterogeneity of the municipal solid waste, taking into account the shear strength and the unit weight of the municipal solid waste randomly. Finally, the safety factor, probability of failure, and risk were assessed using different analysis cases. Deterministic analysis was also performed for all modes using mean values for various municipal solid waste properties. The results show that spatial variability of municipal solid waste parameters and autocorrelation structures significantly affect the safety factor, probability of failure, and risk. Also, comparing the obtained results revealed that for the given slope, the safety factor values in deterministic analyses are overestimated compared to those of the probabilistic analyses. However, risk shows the opposite behavior.},

  abstract  = {A downburst is a strong downdraft that causes radiating, catastrophic winds at or near the ground. Relevant research conducted in the past decades shows that downbursts not only bring damage to the built environment but also have surprisingly destructive effects on aircraft and other flying objects. However, due to the complexity of atmospheric phenomena and limited measurement datasets, many uncertainties remain to be clarified in the understanding and modelling of the downburst wind field. To further explore the evolution characteristics of thunderstorms, this study uses data recorded during thunderstorms by a Doppler profiler of the Hong Kong Observatory and a near-ground anemometer installed at the Hong Kong International Airport to conduct a detailed feature analysis of the vertical profile and turbulence characteristics of downbursts within the atmospheric boundary layer. Based on long-term field measurements during thunderstorm events, the occurrence of a thunderstorm should be determined by a combination of simultaneous variations in multiple meteorological factors, including wind speed and direction, vertical wind speed, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). During thunderstorms, extreme wind speeds occurred in the lower atmosphere and the height of the local peaks seems to be stable in the thunderstorm wind profiles. In addition, both methods, which consider a constant mean component (stationary) and a slowly varying mean component (non-stationary), are used to decompose the measured wind speed and are then compared to investigate the turbulence characteristics of downbursts. Although the gust factor and turbulence intensity show some deviation due to the influence of atmospheric stratification instability, this effect does not appear to be reflected in the turbulence integral scale.},

Different groups’ fragmented and reductionist views on this topic create a dichotomy that makes it difficult to compare and analyze them in practice. Such groups use different values for some components, which may result in neglecting others and their interrelationship. This study discusses a functional characteristic of business models that academia still needs to address. It explores new frontiers in the field, such as business models for networks, sustainability, and their practical evaluation. To achieve an integrative ontology and avoid focusing on specific constructs or systems at the expense of others, we draw upon the theory of worldviews from Wilhelm Dilthey, reformational philosophy, and Herman Dooyeweerd’s theory of modal aspects. Society should move beyond dualistic thinking and embrace practical and applicable solutions. To help companies develop effective models, we introduce a new business model framework based on an integrative worldview that enables comparisons and evaluations of companies in practice. Creating competitive advantages and value appropriations synergizes with essential aspects of reformational philosophy. Analyzing and interrelating such elements are fundamental to understanding the real applied value of business models.},

  abstract  = {In times of crises, such as the refugee crisis or the corona pandemic, the workload in public administrations increases because of the demands of citizens or short-term legal changes. In addition, there is an increasing need for digitalization or to be able to react flexibly to changes. Agile process models and agile practices are appropriate to overcome these challenges. The objective of this paper is to investigate how public administrations can measure their degree of agility to identify potential for improving it. The authors conducted a descriptive single-case study which included multiple units of analysis in a public administration in Germany. The case study was supported by their questionnaire for measuring the degree of agility. One outcome of this study is a conceptual framework that can be used to drive agile transformation in public administrations by continuously measuring agility. Therefore, a questionnaire for measuring agility at team level in public administrations has been developed. The application of the questionnaire in three teams provide insights into dysfunctionality in the interdisciplinary teams as well as optimization potential in terms of affinity to change. The adoption of agility in public administration is a challenge, given that resistance to change is still prevalent. A transformational change is a constant journey, and therefore, the measurement of progress plays an important role in the continuous improvement of an organization. The applied approach delivers high potential for improvement in terms of agility and provides interesting insights for both practitioners and academics.},

  abstract  = {The porting or translation of software applications from one programming language to another is a common requirement of organisations that utilise software, and the increasing number and diversity of programming languages makes this capability as relevant today as in previous decades. Several approaches have been used to address this challenge, including machine learning and the manual definition of direct language-to-language translation rules, however the accuracy of these approaches remains unsatisfactory. In this paper we describe a new approach to program translation using model-driven engineering techniques: reverse-engineering source programs into specifications in the UML and OCL formalisms, and then forward-engineering the specifications to the required target language. This approach can provide assurance of semantic preservation, and additionally has the advantage of extracting precise specifications of software from code. We provide an evaluation based on a comprehensive dataset of examples, including industrial cases, and compare our results to those of other approaches and tools. Our specific contributions are: (1) Reverse-engineering source programs to detailed semantic models of software behaviour, to enable semantically-correct translations and reduce re-testing costs; (2) Program abstraction processes defined by precise and explicit rules, which can be edited and configured by users; (3) A set of reusable OCL library components appropriate for representing program semantics, and which can also be used for OCL specification of new applications; (4) A systematic procedure for building program abstractors based on language grammars and semantics.},

  abstract  = {Background Rapid antigen-detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 self-testing represent a useful tool for pandemic control and expanding access to community-level case screening. COVID-19 self-tests have been extensively used in high-income countries since 2021; however, their introduction and programmatic implementation in low- and middle-income countries was delayed. We aimed to identify and continuously improve a weekly COVID-19 self-testing model among staff at healthcare facilities and schools. Methods This mixed-methods, observational prospective study was conducted in 5 healthcare centres and 24 schools in Georgia, between June and December 2022. The study comprised the integration of COVID-19 self-testing into the national mandatory testing programme for high-risk groups, with primary distribution of self-tests among staff performed weekly, plus secondary distribution to their household members. These use cases were selected because NCDC was seeking to strengthen their already strong weekly testing programme, by investigating self-testing to ease the burden of testing in the healthcare system. Online surveys and semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Results In total, 2156 participants were enrolled (1963 female, 72},

Secondly, the probability of the stoppage caused by different factors can be obtained after the statistical analysis of the factors responsible for the stoppage of tunnel No. 1. Finally, the expected construction period and completion probability of tunnel No. 2 under different pessimism and optimism conditions are obtained by using the progress risk analysis theory of emotional models and the program evaluation and review technique method. An engineering application showed that the expected construction period increased, and the completion probability decreased considerably with increasing pessimism; the opposite trend occurred as optimism increased. During the process of risk management and control, the prediction model can be used to perform precise quantitative analysis of the expected construction period and completion probability, reduce the blindness of construction management, control decisions of complex giant tunnel projects, and provide a more accurate basis for decision makers to judge risks. The findings of this study can be applied to hydraulic tunnels and can provide a reference for traffic tunnels, railway tunnels, and other similar projects.},

  abstract  = {Telematics data, primarily collected from on-board vehicle devices (OBDs), has been utilised in this study to generate a thorough understanding of driving behaviour. The urban case study area is the large metropolitan region of the West Midlands, UK, but the approach is generalizable and translatable to other global urban regions. The new approach of GeoSpatial and Temporal Mapping of Urban Mobility (GeoSTMUM) is used to convert telematics data into driving metrics, including the relative time the vehicle fleet spends idling, cruising, accelerating, and decelerating. The telematics data is also used to parameterize driving volatility and aggressiveness, which are key factors within road safety, which is a global issue. Two approaches to defining aggressive driving are applied and assessed, they are vehicle jerk (the second derivative of vehicle speed), and the profile of speed versus acceleration/deceleration. The telematics-based approach has a very high spatial resolution (15–150 m) and temporal resolution (2 h), which can be used to develop more accurate driving cycles. The approach allows for the determination of road segments with the highest potential for aggressive driving and highlights where additional safety measures could beneficially be adopted. Results highlight the strong correlation between vehicle road occupancy and aggressive driving.},

  abstract  = {Over the past 40 years, China has witnessed the world’s largest urbanization process. In light of its natural and cultural conditions featuring resource scarcity, frequent natural disasters, rich cultural heritage and regional disparities and dynamics, this process aggravates the complex and severe problems faced by urban areas, including resource and environmental damage, security risks and cultural degradation. To address these issues, a shift in national and regional urban spatial layouts from improving economic competitiveness to balancing protection and development as well as security and development is needed. Related theories and research methods should also be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, given China’s specific conditions and regional spatial layouts, the paper introduces the “national spatial planning theory,” which aims to create a sound living environment. The core concept is “precise adaptation,” which ensures the adaption of urban development to natural and cultural conditions. It is the first theory that proposes to develop the national urban spatial layout based on the analysis of ecological environment. It also suggests shifting the focus from eco-environment to security and culture as urbanization progresses and problems change constantly. In addition, a method framework and technical system of “precise analysis, adaptive distribution and dynamic evaluation” is formulated to build an adaptive urban spatial layout on the basis of quantitative analysis of the capacity of spatial resources. The practices of regional planning processes on varying scales in the past 20 years are to illustrate the specific applications of the theoretical approach.},

  abstract  = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) uses models as first-class artefacts during the software development lifecycle. MDE often relies on domain-specific languages (DSLs) to develop complex systems. The construction of a new DSL implies a deep understanding of a domain, whose relevant knowledge may be scattered in heterogeneous artefacts, like XML documents, (meta-)models, and ontologies, among others. This heterogeneity hampers their reuse during (meta-)modelling processes. Under the hypothesis that reusing heterogeneous knowledge helps in building more accurate models, more efficiently, in previous works we built a (meta-)modelling assistant called Extremo . Extremo represents heterogeneous information sources with a common data model, supports its uniform querying and reusing information chunks for building (meta-)models. To understand how and whether modelling assistants—like Extremo —help in designing a new DSL, we conducted an empirical study, which we report in this paper. In the study, participants had to build a meta-model, and we measured the accuracy of the artefacts, the perceived usability and utility and the time to completion of the task. Interestingly, our results show that using assistance did not lead to faster completion times. However, participants using Extremo were more effective and efficient, produced meta-models with higher levels of completeness and correctness, and overall perceived the assistant as useful. The results are not only relevant to Extremo , but we discuss their implications for future modelling assistants.},

  abstract  = {The discrete element method (DEM) is frequently used to investigate the behaviour of granular media (Bravo in Simulation of soil and tillage-tool interaction by the discrete element method, 2013; Tijskens et al. in J Sound Vib 266:493–514, 2003; Langston et al. in Chem Eng Sci 50:967–987, 1995; Kohring et al. in Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 124:273–281, 1995; Stahl et al. in Granul Matter 13:417–428, 2011). The parameter calibration is a challenging task due to the large number of input parameters and the computational effort. Sometimes, this is performed with a trial-and-error approach as mentioned in Roessler et al. (Powder Technol 343:803–812, 2019), Rackl and Hanley (Powder Technol 307:73–83, 2017) based on laboratory tests, e.g. the pile experiment, the oedometer experiment and the shear test. To achieve a more suitable calibration, a better model understanding is necessary in which the influence of the DEM parameters is analysed. Consequently, the calibration can be focused on specific parameters, which have a significant influence on thef model response. If parameters with a negligibly small influence exist, the number of calibration parameters can be reduced. On this basis, it is possible to decide whether the laboratory test is suitable for the calibration of specific parameters or not. This is demonstrated with a sensitivity analysis based on Sobol’ indices for the oedometer laboratory test. In order to reduce the computational effort, the sensitivity analysis is performed with different metamodels of the oedometer simulation. The metamodels are fitted and validated with two separate sampling point sets. It is shown that the Young’s modulus for the investigated input space is the most significant parameter. This knowledge can be used to only focus the calibration on this significant parameter which enables an easier calibration and makes clear that for calibrating of other parameters this laboratory test is inappropriate. An algorithm of a force-driven plate is developed and shown which prevents non-physical states in which the interaction force between the particles and the loadplate exceeds the applied force.},

  abstract  = {Performance analysis during the early design stage can significantly reduce building energy consumption. However, it is difficult to transform computer-aided design (CAD) models into building energy models (BEM) to optimize building performance. The model structures for CAD and BEM are divergent. In this study, geometry transformation methods was implemented in BES tools for the early design stage, including auto space generation (ASG) method based on closed contour recognition (CCR) and space boundary topology calculation method. The program is developed based on modeling tools SketchUp to support the CAD format (like *.stl, *.dwg, *.ifc, etc.). It transforms face-based geometric information into a zone-based tree structure model that meets the geometric requirements of a single-zone BES combined with the other thermal parameter inputs of the elements. In addition, this study provided a space topology calculation method based on a single-zone BEM output. The program was developed based on the SketchUp modeling tool to support additional CAD formats (such as *.stl, *.dwg, *.ifc), which can then be imported and transformed into *.obj. Compared to current methods mostly focused on BIM-BEM transformation, this method can ensure more modeling flexibility. The method was integrated into a performance analysis tool termed MOOSAS and compared with the current version of the transformation program. They were tested on a dataset comprising 36 conceptual models without partitions and six real cases with detailed partitions. It ensures a transformation rate of two times in any bad model condition and costs only 1/5 of the time required to calculate each room compared to the previous version.},

Formal verification lends a powerful framework for model-based safety assurance, but due to the mixed discrete–continuous behavior of automotive systems, traditional tools for discrete program verification are helpful but not sufficient. In academia, during the last two decades new approaches arose for the formal verification of such mixed discrete-continuous systems. However, the industry is not fully aware of this development, the tools are seldom tried and their applicability is not well examined. In a Ford–RWTH research alliance project, we aimed at evaluating the potential of knowledge and technology transfer in this area. This paper has two main objectives. Firstly, we want to report on the state-of-the-art in the above-mentioned academic development in a generally understandable form, targeted to interested potential users. Secondly, we want to share our observations after testing different available tools for their applicability and usability in the automotive sector and as a conclusion devise some recommendations.},

  abstract  = {The recent emerging trend to promote the harmonious interactions between human and smart objects in Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to the rising demand for the comprehensive exploration of associated IoT design spaces, considering system-, network-, and human-level perspectives. The traditional design approach of networked smart objects tends to ignore the effects caused by human interactions so that the existing approach has the limited capability in joint system/network/human multi-level exploration. In this paper, we propose a high-level system modeling and multi-level simulation approach for microsystem models to interoperate with high-level models in the human-level perspective and to provide comprehensive co-exploration. The high-level system modeling enables one to abstract the detailed operations of hardware platforms using power and timing data obtained by the proposed high-level state-based profiling method and using the event-driven modeling concept. For the event-driven system modeling, we utilize the discrete-event system specification (DEVS) to support scalable model-driven prototyping. To represent the coupled relationship of network-level system activity and human-level interactions between node systems and humans, we employ a general-purpose network simulator to model the operation and communication of network modules in smart objects and developed agent-based human behavioral models. For the co-simulation of multi-level models, we designed a distributed simulation platform to enable the interoperation between the DEVS simulator and the network simulator using a runtime infrastructure. The proposed modeling and simulation approach is applied for the multi-level evaluation of a smart museum application to estimate the effect of energy-efficiency policies.},

  abstract  = {The healthcare sectors have constantly faced significant challenge due to the rapid rise of cyber threats. These threats can pose any potential risk within the system context and disrupt the critical healthcare service delivery. It is therefore necessary for the healthcare organisations to understand and tackle the threats to ensure overall security and resilience. However, threats are continuously evolved and there is large amount of unstructured security-related textual information is available. This makes the threat assessment and management task very challenging. There are a number of existing works that consider Machine Learning models for detection and prediction of cyber attack but they lack of focus on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract the threat information from unstructured security-related text. To this end, this work proposes a novel method to assess and manage threats by adopting natural language processing. The proposed method has been tailored for the healthcare ecosystem and allows to identify and assess the possible threats within healthcare information infrastructure so that appropriate control and mitigation actions can be taken into consideration to tackle the threat. In detail, NLP techniques are used to extract the useful threat information related to specific assets of the healthcare ecosystems from the largely available security-related information on Internet (e.g. cyber security news), to evaluate the level of the identified threats and to select the required mitigation actions. We have performed experiments on real healthcare ecosystems in Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering, considering in particular three different healthcare scenarios, namely implantable medical devices, wearables, and biobank, with the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of our approach, which is able to provide a realistic manner to identify and assess the threats, evaluate the threat level and suggest the required mitigation actions.},

Using a realistic and large event-log, we compare two such programming-oriented monitoring language systems to a temporal logic-based monitoring system that was previously evaluated on the same log. The first programming-oriented language is a library in Scala developed for runtime verification. The other language is a scripting language, originally developed for fast static code analysis.

 μ CT data of the mouse tibia loading model that investigated bone adaptation in response to sciatic neurectomy and various peak load magnitudes ( F  = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 N). A beam theory-based approach was developed to simulate cortical bone adaptation in different sections of the tibia, using longitudinal strains as the adaptive stimuli. We developed four mechanostat models: universal, surface-based, strain directional-based, and combined surface and strain direction-based. Rates of bone adaptation in these mechanostat models were computed using an optimisation procedure (131,606 total simulations), performed on a single load case ( F = 10 N). Subsequently, the models were validated against the remaining six peak loads. Our findings indicate that local bone adaptation responses are quasi-linear and bone region specific. The mechanostat model which accounted for differences in endosteal and periosteal regions and strain directions (i.e. tensile versus compressive) produced the lowest root mean squared error between simulated and experimental data for all loads, with a combined prediction accuracy of 76.6, 55.0 and 80.7},

  abstract  = {Recently, there has been a recognized need to use waste lime landfills for land reclamation projects. Waste lime earthwork is more challenging than general earthwork operations due to potential health and safety hazards and significant changes in earthwork volume. There has been substantial research undertaken on the role of advanced construction technologies in general earthwork; however, their potential in hazardous waste lime environments for earthwork management is yet to be explored. This research proposes a methodology that integrates drone and BIM construction technology for effective and efficient hazardous waste lime earthwork management for construction projects. Drones are used for surveying, providing as-built information, and BIM to model, process, and evaluate the progress of waste lime earthwork. Volume change analyses are conducted using BIM to calculate dehydration time due to the ripple effect of waste lime for cost-efficient earthwork haulage. The case study provides evidence that the proposed method using advanced construction technologies improves productivity, safety, cost control, and better project management for earthwork related to hazardous waste materials.},

  abstract  = {PANoptosis has recently been discovered as a new type of cell death. PANoptosis mainly refers to the significant interaction among the three programmed cell death pathways of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Despite this, only a few studies have examined the systematic literature in this area. By analyzing the bibliometric data for PANoptosis, we can visualize the current hotspots and predicted trends in research. This study analyzed bibliometric indicators using the Histcite Pro 2.0 tool, which searches the Web of Science for PANoptosis literature published between 2016 and 2022. A bibliometric analysis was performed using Histcite Pro 2.0, while research trends and hotspots were visualized using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and BioBERT. The output of related literature was low in the four years from the first presentation of PANoptosis in 2016 to 2020. The volume of relevant literature grew exponentially between 2020 and 2022. The United States and China play a leading role in this field. Although China started late, its research in this field is developing rapidly. As research progressed, more focus was placed on the relationship between PANoptosis and pyroptosis, as well as apoptosis and necrosis. Now is a rapid development stage of PANoptosis research. Most of the research focuses on the cellular level, and the focus is more on the treatment of tumor-related diseases. The current focus of this area is PANoptosis mechanisms in cancer and inflammation. It can be seen from the burst analysis of keywords that caspase1 and host defense have consistently been research hotspots in the field of PANoptosis, while the frequency of NLRC4, causes of autoinflammation, recognition, NLRP3, and Gasdermin D has gradually increased, all of which have become research hotspots in recent years. Finally, we used the BioBERT biomedical language model to mine the most documented genes and diseases in the PANoptosis field articles, pointing out the direction for subsequent research steps. According to a bibliometric analysis, researchers have shown an increased interest in PANoptosis over the past few years. Researchers initially focused on the molecular mechanism of PANoptosis and pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The role of PANoptosis in diseases and conditions such as inflammation and tumors is one of the current research hotspots in this area. The focus is more on treating inflammation-related diseases, which will become the key development direction of future research.},

Methods First, Euler–Lagrange equation of the system is established based on Hamilton’s principle. Then, with the mathematical modeling, the dynamic response of the system is derived using Harmonic Balance Method, which is discussed by numerical analysis. Based on the analytical solutions, the effects on harvesting power changed by different assembly angles, connecting rod length and excitation amplitudes are studied particularly. The advantageous harvesting performance of the proposed system is shown by comparing it with a corresponding conventional linear system. Results The result shows that the triangular structure in the system is beneficial for expanding the power output and energy-harvesting bandwidth. Further, the resonant frequency of the system can be tuned to a desired value by adjusting the assembly angle according to the characteristics of surrounding vibration sources. Conclusions Therefore, the harvester system in this work is demonstrated to provide an effective method for design to scavenge the low-frequency vibration energy from the ambient environment in engineering.},

  abstract  = {Traffic volume propagating from upstream road link to downstream road link is the key parameter for designing intersection signal timing scheme. Recent works successfully used graph convolutional network (GCN) and specific time-series model to forecast traffic flow by capturing the spatial–temporal features. However, accurately predicting traffic propagation flow ( tpf ) is challenging, since the classical GCN model only considers the influence of adjacent road link. In complex urban road network, specific traffic propagation flow ( tpf ) is affected by various spatial features, such as adjacent tpf , which influences from tpf with same upstream link and tpf with same downstream link. Thus, we proposed a multi-graph learning-based model named TPP-GCN (traffic propagation prediction-graph convolutional network) in this paper to predict the traffic propagation flow in urban road network. The TPP-GCN model captures not only the temporal features but also multi-spatial features based on multi-layer convolution. We validated the model using real-world traffic flow data derived from taxi GPS data in Shenzhen, China. Finally, we compare and evaluate the proposed model with the existing models across several prediction scales.},

  abstract  = {The interaction of a controlled series compensator (CSC) with other power electronics and basic power components in a multi-microgrid (MMG) maybe lead to complex resonance problems. In this paper, the frequency domain analysis method and the mode analysis method are combined to analyze the resonance characteristics of the medium-voltage microgrid cluster system under the action of two controllable series compensators, transformer-coupled series compensator (TCSC) and capacitive-coupled series compensator (CCSC). Firstly, based on the equivalent output impedance models of TCSC and CCSC, the equivalent output impedance characteristics of TCSC and CCSC are explored by frequency domain analysis. Secondly, combined with the impedance network model of cluster system, the resonance characteristics of the MMG after separate and together access to these two controllable series compensators at different locations are explored by modal analysis method. The results show that the equivalent output impedance of the two couple-type compensators in a certain frequency band is capacitive, and CCSC has a wider capacitive frequency band. Changes in controller parameter selection can affect band range and capacitance degree. The CSC control parameters affect the system resonance frequency and resonance center, and when the grid-connected inverter circuit parameters are different, the mode of system resonance will also change. The combination of frequency domain analysis and modal analysis is an effective means to study the resonance stability of microgrid cluster systems.},

  abstract  = {The global surge in photovoltaic (PV) installations and the resulting increase in PV waste are a growing concern. The aims of this study include predicting the volume of photovoltaic waste in Canada. The forecasting of solar waste volume employed linear regression, 2nd order polynomial regression, and power regression models. The study’s results indicate that Canada is on the verge of facing challenges related to the end-of-life treatment of photovoltaic modules in the coming years due to the significant growth in PV capacity over recent decades. According to the analysis, for early loss, the PV waste volume in 2045 could range from 180,000 MT to 270,000 MT, and for regular loss, it could range from 160,000 MT to 180,000 MT. This research is anticipated to assist relevant government agencies in assessing the prospective volume of PV waste to establish a sustainable and resilient PV waste management plan for Canada. These findings may shed light on the feasibility of a circular economy and advocate for the involvement of all stakeholders in a carefully coordinated strategy to mitigate potential environmental impacts and optimize resource utilization efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Different pitch parameters of the tool can lead to the changes in the delay of the machining system. A mechanical model of the variable pitch tool is developed by taking the regenerative chatter into account in the machining system with multiple delays. The dynamic differential equations with multiple delays are studied based on the fully discrete method; the Gaussian integral method is used to approximate the state item of the vibration response in the discrete interval, and the periodic and the delay items are linearly approximated to determine the transition matrix of the discrete state in the multiple delays period. The relationship between cutting force coefficients and cutting parameters is defined based on the size effect of the tool-workpiece contact area; a nonlinear model of the cutting force coefficients is presented by the cutting force detection experiment of aluminum alloy milling with the variable pitch tool. The state transition matrix of the multiple delays system is obtained by combining the Gauss full discrete method with the nonlinear cutting force coefficients, and then the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by analyzing the convergence degree of the eigenvalue of state transition matrix. At the same time, the relationship between cutting parameters and the stability critical of the machining system is analyzed to draw the three-dimensional stability lobe diagram, which makes it clear that the limiting cutting depth of the tool increases about 2–3 times as the cutting width decreases. Combining with a cutting stability experiment of the variable pitch tool, it is verified that the dynamic model with the nonlinear dynamic parameters has higher prediction accuracy of the cutting stability than others. And it is observed that the eigenvalue of changes of the dynamic model is more violently in the low speed region (2000–4000 rpm), which indicates that the stability of the processing system is more sensitive to the cutting depth under the low speed condition, and the vibration reduction performance of variable pitch tools is more significant.},

The variational model minimizes an energy functional consisting of a regularization term of the total length of object boundaries and a data-fitting term partitioning the image. Specifically, the total length is approximated by the convolution of the heat kernel with the characteristic functions of the segmented regions of interest. The data-fitting term is derived from the multiplicative bias field resulting in a local intensity clustering property and further weighted by the local entropy. One of the most advantageous features of the proposed model is that it can simultaneously segment the image and estimate the bias field for intensity inhomogeneity correction. Moreover, a simple and efficient iterative convolution-thresholding scheme can be applied to realize the model, exhibiting the energy-decaying property. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to validate the superior performance of the approach.},

In terms of the magnitude of chemotaxis, the global solvability of the model is extensively studied by employing semigroup methods, loop arguments, and energy estimates. In a limiting case, the necessary conditions for chemotaxis-driven instability are established regarding the degree of chemotactic attraction. Spatial aggregation may occur along strong chemotaxis in a two-dimensional domain due to solution explosion. We further observe that spatial segregation appears for short-lived free pathogens in a one-dimensional domain, whereas strong chemotactic repulsion homogenizes the infected hosts and thus fails to segregate host groups effectively.},

  abstract  = {Utility of PI3Kα inhibitors like BYL719 is limited by the acquisition of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance which cause disease recurrence. Several combination therapies based on PI3K inhibition have been proposed, but a way to systematically prioritize them for breast cancer treatment is still missing. By integrating published and in-house studies, we have developed in silico models that quantitatively capture dynamics of PI3K signaling at the network-level under a BYL719-sensitive versus BYL719 resistant-cell state. Computational predictions show that signal rewiring to alternative components of the PI3K pathway promote resistance to BYL719 and identify PDK1 as the most effective co-target with PI3Kα rescuing sensitivity of resistant cells to BYL719. To explore whether PI3K pathway-independent mechanisms further contribute to BYL719 resistance, we performed phosphoproteomics and found that selection of high levels of the cell cycle regulator p21 unexpectedly promoted drug resistance in T47D cells. Functionally, high p21 levels favored repair of BYL719-induced DNA damage and bypass of the associated cellular senescence. Importantly, targeted inhibition of the check-point inhibitor CHK1 with MK-8776 effectively caused death of p21-high T47D cells, thus establishing a new vulnerability of BYL719-resistant breast cancer cells. Together, our integrated studies uncover hidden molecular mediators causing resistance to PI3Kα inhibition and provide a framework to prioritize combination therapies for PI3K-mutant breast cancer.},

  abstract  = {1. A mechanical model was constructed by theory of the thin plate and the key layer that cloud analyze the initial and periodic roof breakages of conventional working face. 2. During the periodic roof breakage phase, the mechanical response of the roof's bending under stress was more obvious than the initial fracture stage. 3. The study can provide scientific guidance and technical support for the stability control of the working face roof and the selection of load-bearing pillars. The variation in the width of the mining face significantly affects the stability of the face, leading to potential roof fracturing and collapse. Additionally, strong mining pressure can manifest, severely impeding the safe production of coal mines. This study uses the No. 16705 conventional working face of Jinda Coal Mine as its engineering background to investigate the characteristics of roof strata movement and instability under conditions of variable-width mining in shallow-buried thin coal seams. First, the dynamic load of the roof strata is estimated based on the key strata theory. Next, a mechanical model of the immediate roof strata movement in the working face is established based on the theory of elastic thin plates, which has been used to reveal the impact of different dimensions of the overhanging plate structure and residual overhanging structures in the corner on roof movement and its associated fracture mechanics. The findings indicated that the maximum bending deformation, deformation moment, and bending stress all have an exponential function relationship with the roof width. Similarly, these metrics have an exponential function relationship with the overhanging span of the roof. In addition, these parameters all have a linear functional relationship with the size of the residual overhanging structures in the corner. Finally, the effect of roof instability on overlying pressure is analyzed, and both the initial fracture step length and cyclic movement fracture step length of the roof are estimated. These insights offer valuable scientific guidance and a theoretical foundation for analyzing the adaptability of load-bearing pillars pressure in thin coal seam mining faces, bearing significant relevance to safety production.},

S. cerevisiae , a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) microorganism, has been frequently employed to generate heterologous proteins. However, constructing a universal yeast chassis for efficient protein production is still a challenge due to the varying properties of different proteins. With progress in synthetic biology, a multitude of molecular biology tools and metabolic engineering strategies have been employed to alleviate these issues. This review first analyses the advantages of protein production by S. cerevisiae . The most recent advances in improving heterologous protein yield are summarized and discussed in terms of protein hyperexpression systems, protein secretion engineering, glycosylation pathway engineering and systems metabolic engineering.

  abstract  = {Underwater image enhancement is a technique that improves the quality of underwater images, which makes them clearer and more realistic. However, because of the complexity of underwater environments, underwater image enhancement faces many challenges, such as the variation in underwater optical properties as well as low contrast, low brightness, and color distortion in underwater images. To extract underwater image features more effectively, this paper proposes an underwater image enhancement algorithm called cross attention-based underwater image enhancement (CAUIE). The algorithm combines cross large kernel attention and dynamic enhancement modules to build a U-Net model. Cross larger attention uses large kernel attention mechanism to capture the local and global information of underwater images alternately, thus enhancing the semantic representation of the images. The dynamic enhancement module, by contrast, dynamically adjusts the enhancement parameters according to different regions of the image to acquire detail information. In addition, this paper introduces a contrast regularization loss to construct a hybrid loss function for guiding the training and optimization of the model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithm in both subjective visual and objective evaluation criteria. Moreover, the proposed model obtains PSNR and SSIM results of 34.86 dB and 0.996, respectively, increasing the results of the previous model by 7.97 dB and 0.099, which illustrates that the proposed algorithm can solve the color distortion problem and recover the contrast and clarity of underwater images.And CAUIE achieved good results in two no-reference underwater evaluation metrics UIQM and UCIQE.},

  abstract  = {Drone technology is advancing rapidly and represents significant benefits during firefighting operations. This paper presents a novel approach for autonomous firefighting missions for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed UAV framework consists of a local planner module that finds an obstacle-free path to guide the vehicle toward a target zone. After detecting the target point, the UAV plans an optimal trajectory to perform a precision ballistic launch of an extinguishing ball, exploiting its kinematics. The generated trajectory minimises the overall traversal time and the final state error while respecting UAV dynamic limits. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated both in simulations and real tests with randomly positioned obstacles and target locations. The proposed framework has been employed in the 2022 UAV Competition of the International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), where it successfully completed the mission in several runs of increasing difficulty, both in simulation and in real scenarios, achieving third place overall.

  abstract  = {Background Animals of many different species, trophic levels, and life history strategies migrate, and the improvement of animal tracking technology allows ecologists to collect increasing amounts of detailed data on these movements. Understanding when animals migrate is important for managing their populations, but is still difficult despite modelling advancements. Methods We designed a model that parametrically estimates the timing of migration from animal tracking data. Our model identifies the beginning and end of migratory movements as signaled by change-points in step length and turning angle distributions. To this end, we can also use the model to estimate how an animal’s movement changes when it begins migrating. In addition to a thorough simulation analysis, we tested our model on three datasets: migratory ferruginous hawks ( Buteo regalis ) in the Great Plains, barren-ground caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus ) in northern Canada, and non-migratory brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) from the Canadian Arctic. Results Our simulation analysis suggests that our model is most useful for datasets where an increase in movement speed or directional autocorrelation is clearly detectable. We estimated the beginning and end of migration in caribou and hawks to the nearest day, while confirming a lack of migratory behaviour in the brown bears. In addition to estimating when caribou and ferruginous hawks migrated, our model also identified differences in how they migrated; ferruginous hawks achieved efficient migrations by drastically increasing their movement rates while caribou migration was achieved through significant increases in directional persistence. Conclusions Our approach is applicable to many animal movement studies and includes parameters that can facilitate comparison between different species or datasets. We hope that rigorous assessment of migration metrics will aid understanding of both how and why animals move.},

  abstract  = {Mathematical models are increasingly being developed and calibrated in tandem with data collection, empowering scientists to intervene in real time based on quantitative model predictions. Well-designed experiments can help augment the predictive power of a mathematical model but the question of when to collect data to maximize its utility for a model is non-trivial. Here we define data as model-informative if it results in a unique parametrization, assessed through the lens of practical identifiability. The framework we propose identifies an optimal experimental design (how much data to collect and when to collect it) that ensures parameter identifiability (permitting confidence in model predictions), while minimizing experimental time and costs. We demonstrate the power of the method by applying it to a modified version of a classic site-of-action pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model that describes distribution of a drug into the tumor microenvironment (TME), where its efficacy is dependent on the level of target occupancy in the TME. In this context, we identify a minimal set of time points when data needs to be collected that robustly ensures practical identifiability of model parameters. The proposed methodology can be applied broadly to any mathematical model, allowing for the identification of a minimally sufficient experimental design that collects the most informative data.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, the authors reveal a robust weakening of the subtropical atmospheric circulation across CMIP6 models driven by global-mean surface warming, which is partially offset by the direct CO_2 effect. The lower tropospheric subtropical circulation (SC) is characterized by monsoons and subtropical highs, playing an important role in global teleconnections and climate variability. The SC changes in a warmer climate are influenced by complex and region-specific mechanisms, resulting in uneven projections worldwide. Here, we present a method to quantify the overall intensity change in global SC, revealing a robust weakening across CMIP6 models. The weakening is primarily caused by global-mean surface warming, and partly counteracted by the direct CO_2 effect. The direct CO_2 effect is apparent in the transient response but is eventually dominated by the surface warming effect in a slow response. The distinct response timescales to global-mean warming and direct CO_2 radiative forcing can well explain the time-varying SC changes in other CO_2 emission scenarios. The declined SC implies a contracted monsoon range and drying at its boundary with arid regions under CO_2-induced global warming.},

  abstract  = {In the past decade, the modeling community has produced many feature-rich modeling editors and tool prototypes not only for modeling standards but particularly also for many domain-specific languages. More recently, however, web-based modeling tools have started to become increasingly popular in the industry for visualizing and editing models adhering to such languages. This new generation of modeling tools is built with web technologies and offers much more flexibility when it comes to their user experience, accessibility, reuse, and deployment options. One of the technologies behind this new generation of tools is the Graphical Language Server Platform (GLSP), an open-source client-server framework hosted under the Eclipse foundation, which allows tool developers to build modern diagram editors for modeling tools that run in the browser or can be easily integrated into IDEs such as Eclipse, VS Code, or Theia. In this paper, we describe our vision for more flexible modeling tools which is based on our experiences from developing several traditional and web-based modeling tools in an industrial and academic context. With that, we aim at sparking a new line of research and innovation in the modeling community for modeling tool development practices and to explore opportunities, advantages, and limitations of web-based modeling tools, as well as bridge the gap between scientific tool prototypes and industrial tools being used in practice.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) have been developed quickly in recent years, robust and complete system requirements are essential for high-quality ADSs. Requirements modeling is a process of describing and analyzing system requirements using various techniques, which is a critical step for ensuring high-reliability requirements. Restricted Use Case Modeling (RUCM) is a use case modeling method to reduce the ambiguity of requirements written in natural language, which has been extended to diverse applications. By extending RUCM with autonomous driving concepts, RUCM for Autonomous Driving Systems (RUCM4ADS) can specify autonomous driving scenarios in the form of use case specifications and diagrams. However, due to the diversity and complexity of autonomous driving scenarios, the constructed requirement models require multiple manifestations to be compared and analyzed. To this end, in this paper, we extend the metamodel of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and activity diagrams according to the Wise Drive framework for accurately expressing autonomous driving concepts and behaviors. Further, we realize modeling autonomous driving scenarios with extended UML meta-models, which enrich the manifestation of autonomous driving requirements. Meanwhile, we propose automatic model transformation approaches to promote the automatic analysis of autonomous driving scenario requirements, which generates UML extended models from RUCM4ADS models based on proposed extended metamodels. Finally, two real-world autonomous driving scenarios are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model transformation approach. Results show that our proposed approach is effective, and can generate high semantic and syntactic accuracy class diagrams and activity diagrams with autonomous driving concepts and behaviors.},

  abstract  = {Mission analysis is the initial process in aircraft development. Its goal is to understand how the aircraft will operate and interact with other systems to accomplish its mission. As a system of systems (SoS) level development process, mission analysis involves various multi-disciplinary and cross-domain models, such as battlefield plotting models, scenario visualization models, SoS architecture models, and multi-agent wargaming models. This results in a heavy modeling workload and presents a significant challenge in maintaining model consistency. To ensure model transferability and consistency, this paper introduces a continuous modeling method for aircraft mission analysis. With the help of a modeling language-independent ontology, it achieves preliminarily model transformation and data transfer between the four kinds of models used in aircraft mission analysis. According to the practice, the continuous method helps improve the continuity and consistency of models and reduce the workload of building and maintaining models.},

  abstract  = {Studies on the effects of digital transformation on enterprise architectures (EA) indicate that variability in the EA increases on different levels, such as the business and the data architecture. Dealing with variability becomes a common challenge in the daily operations of many enterprises and requires methodical and technological support. Methodical support for controlling variability in EA can help enterprises manage variability more efficiently. In this context, the conjecture motivating this paper is that building blocks integrating business and data architecture or allowing for data-aware business process building blocks can help to ensure a high level of flexibility and, at the same time, control complexity in variability management. The paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the requirements, necessary activities and frame conditions of method support for variability management of EA. The paper’s main contribution is an initial method for identifying building blocks in enterprise architecture models that integrate several architecture layers and a way to capture such building blocks as ArchiMate models.},

We then present the composition, restriction and refinement operations in the software development process. Next, the preservation of traceability under these three operations is discussed respectively.

In this approach, smart contracts are used to define and enforce process monitoring and conformance-checking logic for finding commonalities and discrepancies between the contracted and observed behavior during collaborative production execution. However, as smart contracts as tools can not be considered legally binding agreements, the collaborating parties still must go through the bureaucratic hurdle of defining the same conformance-checking logic within textual agreements. In this paper, we present the adaptation of the methodological approach that relies on e-contracting processes and activities to make the logic implemented with smart contracts legally enforceable. The benefits of this adaptation are that it speeds up the establishment of collaborative networks and further promotes trustworthy collaboration. Along with presenting the adaptation of the approach, we describe its implementation.},

Therefore, it is essential that the use-case model is not redundant and its parts are reusable. Existing approaches for the use-case model specification support reusability in a limited way. This paper fills the gap. It introduces a new Use-Case Flow Language to specify the entire use-case model conveniently yet semi-formally. The language is defined at the abstract syntax level by a metamodel with an informal description of the semantics of the metamodel elements. A discussion and justification of metamodel elements is given. A concrete textual syntax of the language is also provided and informally described.

If, e.g., one component requires and one provides an integer value, they can be composed, independently of whether this composition is actually semantically sound. To support software architects in the semantic validation of their system models, we propose a model transformation tool, that allows to transform system models from Palladio models to MontiArc models, enrich them with semantic constraints and validate these constraints with the MontiArc workbench.

Before deployment in series vehicles, it has to be shown that the functions drive safely and in compliance with traffic rules. Despite the coverage that can be reached with very large amounts of test drives, corner cases remain possible. Furthermore, the development is subject to time-to-delivery constraints due to the highly competitive market, and potential logical errors must be found as early as possible. We describe an approach to improve the development of an actual industrial behavior planner for the Automated Driving Alliance between Bosch and Cariad. The original process landscape for verification and validation is extended with model checking techniques. The idea is to integrate automated extraction mechanisms that, starting from the C ++ code of the planner, generate a higher-level model of the underlying logic. This model, composed in closed loop with expressive environment descriptions, can be exhaustively analyzed with model checking. This results, in case of violations, in traces that can be re-executed in system simulators to guide the search for errors. The approach was exemplarily deployed in series development, and successfully found relevant issues in intermediate versions of the planner at development time.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a system testing framework for development of AADL-based systems using the HAMR model-driven development framework. A key theme of the framework is the integration of unit testing and program verification based on formal contracts that are synchronized between models and code. HAMR’s scheduling framework is extended to enable test scripting aligned with AADL’s standardized run-time services (RTS) and real-time task structures. Libraries of state observers and injectors aligned with the AADL RTS are auto-generated, enabling system property tests to observe system state and force the state to contain certain values. Executable versions of component contracts are automatically checked during system tests. A randomized property-based testing approach is used to generate vectors of input values for subsystem ports, helping to achieve coverage with reduced developer effort. A server-based architecture automatically distributes system tests in a continuous integration environment and accumulates and correlates coverage information. Together with HAMR’s ability to generate system deployments on the verified seL4 micro-kernel, these capabilities provide another step towards the community’s long-term objectives of practical model-based development that integrates formal models, specifications, and rigorously-assured application and infrastructure code at many different levels of abstraction.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, there has been growing concern among experts regarding the risks of hacking autonomous vehicles. As these vehicles become increasingly complex, the number of potential vulnerabilities and challenges associated with securing them also rises. This paper presents a model checking-based framework that utilizes a predefined set of attacks and countermeasures, which are then used to assess the security robustness of the model. First, we formalize a cyber-physical system using Unified Modeling Language (UML) class and activity diagrams. Subsequently, we employ UML to develop a meta-language for autonomous vehicle systems, cyberattacks, and cybersecurity countermeasures. The framework instantiates domain-specific application diagrams for autonomous vehicles, identifies existing attack surfaces, and generates potential attacks that could exploit detected vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Furthermore, the proposed framework generates appropriate Java code for integrating countermeasures, attacks, and smart vehicle models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we model, analyze, harden, and evaluate our framework using a real-world use case. This research aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security of autonomous vehicles and mitigate the risks associated with hacking and other cyber threats. By applying the framework presented in this paper, the goal is to promote a more secure development and implementation of autonomous vehicle systems.},

  abstract  = {Context: Chatbots emerged in the decade of 60 and are currently a popular type of application that provides the experience of talking to a human-like robot. However, the similarity of their behaviour to a human is also what makes the elicitation and documentation of conversational-related requirements a hard task, due to the subjective nature of conversations. Currently there are no standards or guidelines to register and test subjective requirements, present in human conversations. Methods: We proposed a metamodel for documentation of conversational requirements and conducted the validation through a 2-step questionnaire. We then analysed the feedback received and applied improvements in the model instances. Results: Based on metamodel we propose the conversational integrated map, an artifact that correlates the subjective requirements with their associated KPIs. Validation was conducted through a simulation with 4 practitioners in a 2-step questionnaire. Artifact format choice revealed a preference for mainly textual and table models. Scalability and necessary time to complete were points of divergence between answers. Conclusion: Proposed artifact was well accepted and could provide pre-made models available for edition for ease of use. Future steps of this study include the elaboration of a guide of best practices on chatbot documentation.},

Docker was used in this investigation to carry out a variety of tests, which allowed identical code to be executed on a variety of platforms, so permitting extensive comparisons. Software developers made use of Docker's ability to analyze the outcomes, which enabled them to make decisions based on accurate information. This study simplifies the software development and deployment procedures for the development community by providing significant insights into the benefits and considerations of Docker across numerous platforms.},

The results of this study show that these ambiguities yield a significant impact on cognitive load, comprehension, and visual associations. These results raise further attention toward the negative effects of ambiguity from a cognitive and behavioral perspective, and stimulate the development of novel tools supporting ambiguity detection in process models.},

However, due to the complexity and uniqueness of these portfolios, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to predict the evolution of portfolios and assess the impact of every change on the performance regarding the predefined objectives. This leads to emerging uncertainties that portfolio managers must address at each stage of the portfolio management process. To address this problem, we focus on the execution phase of portfolio management process and present through the vision of uncertainty in a portfolio management context, a model-driven framework using the Physics of Decision paradigm to support the execution phase of a projects portfolio. This framework presents a new approach to monitor projects portfolios which add flexibility and information interpretation to the risk management principles and could serve as a basis for the development of future information systems.},

  abstract  = {Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers are widely used to ensure the correctness of safety- and security-critical applications. Therefore, being able to trust a solver’s results is crucial. One way to increase trust is to generate independently checkable proof certificates, which record the reasoning steps done by the solver. A key challenge with this approach is that it is difficult to efficiently and accurately produce proofs for reasoning steps involving term rewriting rules. Previous work showed how a domain-specific language, Rare , can be used to capture rewriting rules for the purposes of proof production. However, in that work, the Rare rules had to be trusted, as the correctness of the rules themselves was not checked by the proof checker. In this paper, we present I sa Rare , a tool that can automatically translate Rare rules into Isabelle/HOL lemmas. The soundness of the rules can then be verified by proving the lemmas. Because an incorrect rule can put the entire soundness of a proof system in jeopardy, our solution closes an important gap in the trustworthiness of SMT proof certificates. The same tool also provides a necessary component for enabling full proof reconstruction of SMT proof certificates in Isabelle/HOL. We evaluate our approach by verifying an extensive set of rewrite rules used by the cvc5 SMT solver.},

Writing algorithms for these systems requires skills and familiarity with programming languages, which can be a barrier for non-expert users. Even if visual programming environments have been proposed for swarm systems, they are often limited to specific platforms or tasks, and do not provide a high-level programming model that can be used to design algorithms for a wide range of swarm systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a low-code swarm programming environment, called ScaFi-Blocks, which allows users to design and implement swarm algorithms visually. ScaFi-Blocks is based on the ScaFi aggregate computing framework, which provides a high-level programming model for the design of distributed algorithms. Aggregate computing is based on the concept of field-based coordination, and it allows users to design algorithms by composing simple building blocks, which motivates the design of the proposed artefact. The environment is designed to be user-friendly and to support the design of a wide range of collective applications. In this paper, we present the architecture of ScaFi-Blocks, discuss its features and capabilities, and provide a preliminary evaluation of the programming environment based on a case study featuring articulated swarm behaviour.},

A representation encompasses software elements, their properties and relationships with other elements. Similar to the architecture of a physical building, it serves as a blueprint for both the system itself and the development process, delineating the tasks to be carried out by the development team. In e-business, a wide variety of such architectures can be found. These have evolved over time, and the emergence and subsequent developments of the Internet have been decisive factors in shaping applications and their associated software architectures. In the 1980s, the purpose of an application was to run on a single computer, but today, applications are increasingly interconnected and accessible from anywhere. Practitioners have realized that a sound architecture is critical for success in both design and development. In order to incorporate domain-specific semantics, knowledge graphs must become a key ingredient to architectural thinking and the codification of principles, methods, and practices has led to repeatable architectural design processes. However, despite these advancements, the field of software architecture remains relatively immature in its relation to knowledge graphs and how to leverage them for e-business – towards this goal, traditional architectural patterns such as MVCs will be revisited in this paper.},

  abstract  = {Resonant plate shock testing techniques have been used for mechanical shock testing at Sandia for several decades. A mechanical shock qualification test is often done by performing three separate uniaxial tests on a resonant plate to simulate one shock event. Multi-axis mechanical shock activities, in which shock specifications are simultaneously met in different directions during a single shock test event performed in the lab, are not always repeatable and greatly depend on the fixture used during testing. This chapter provides insights into various designs of a concept fixture that includes both resonant plate and angle bracket used for multi-axis shock testing from a modeling and simulation point of view based on the results of finite element modal analysis. Initial model validation and testing performed show substantial excitation of the system under test as the fundamental modes drive the response in all three directions. The response also shows that higher order modes are influencing the system, the axial and transverse response are highly coupled, and tunability is difficult to achieve. By varying the material properties, changing thicknesses, adding masses, and moving the location of the fixture on the resonant plate, the response can be changed significantly. The goal of this work is to identify the parameters that have the greatest influence on the response of the system when using the angle bracket fixture for a mechanical shock test for the intent of tunability of the system.},

It takes into account the structure and composition of the report, while also connecting medical terms in the report through the multi-lingual SNOMED Clinical Terms knowledge base. The resulting graph embedding uncovers the underlying relationships among clinical terms, achieving a representation that is better understandable for clinicians and clinically more accurate, without reliance on large pre-training datasets. We show the use of this embedding on two tasks namely disease classification of X-ray reports and image classification. For disease classification our model is competitive with its BERT-based counterparts, while being magnitudes smaller in size and training data requirements. For image classification, we show the effectiveness of the graph embedding leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and show how this method is usable across different languages.},

  abstract  = {Design Optimization is research area which was carried out a lot in the world, with many applications in the specifications of mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, civil engineering. This area can help the engineering designs to be improved and optimized. Executing the global optimization codes is a time-consuming activity in engineering designs, hence the researchers should utilize the approximation methods (or interpolation methods). In this article, the authors will do research about comparing the efficiencies of 2 approximation methods (interpolation methods) Kriging and Radial Basis Function (RBF). The 2 approximation methods (interpolation methods) will be compared in some aspects, such as the accuracy of the methods, the robustness of the methods, the computational cost of the methods. The methods will be applied to approximate several complicated mathematical functions. For the used correlation function and radial basis function in this article, and for the used correlation parameter and width factor in this article, it is investigated that Kriging is more accurate and robust than RBF in finding the approximations (interpolations), Kriging can produce the approximations (interpolations) which are closer to the exact solutions, Kriging can make the approximations (interpolations) with less errors than RBF, Kriging also takes less computational cost than RBF, Kriging is less time-consuming than RBF. In summary, in this circumstance, Kriging is better than RBF.},

  abstract  = {In microservices-based systems, architects find it hard to reason about the impact of their design decisions on performance before implementing them. While definitions of anti-patterns help to avoid inadequate design decisions, they are context-dependent. Static analysis of software design can identify constructs that conform to anti-patterns. However, this is not suitable for quantifying the extent to which these anti-patterns would affect system performance. Ideally, we should be able to predict the dynamic behavior of a system before it is implemented. However, existing approaches either cannot achieve this because they analyze the design statically or require complex and laborious modeling and simulation approaches. To address this challenge, we previously introduced a conceptual solution idea that facilitates rapid evaluation of high-level architectural models by combining both static and dynamic analysis. In this paper, we build upon our previous work and introduce the Microservices Design Evaluator and Performance Tester (MDEPT) approach. Mainly, we formalize modeling specifications for microservices systems, introduce a fully functional toolchain for our approach, and present the evaluation results.},

  abstract  = {With the development of modular robot technology, various forms of modular robots have emerged, such as new unmanned ground vehicles (NUGV) and reconfigurable manipulators. Modular robots can change their structure by replacing modules to meet different environments and tasks. The modules of modular robots are functionally independent and can be flexibly replaced without affecting the entire system. However, due to the different structures of the modules and the different devices they carry, new modules often require redesigning the control program and even the circuit board. In order to improve the design and verification of models, this paper proposes a new design and implementation method that revolves around the Simulation Description Format (SDFormat) model. First, the SDFormat model describes a new modular robot. This work parses the model and generates control logic described in a hardware description language (HDL). Finally, the control logic runs on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) control board. The approach follows the design philosophy of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): SDFormat models adapt control logic to a set of identical modular devices; FPGA programmable logic makes the extracted control logic easy to implement. In addition, this module runs and maintains the original acceleration capabilities of the FPGA. To validate this approach, a simple modular robot model is built. The results show that the control logic is correct and the performance of the modular robot is as expected.},

In order to address this challenge, this paper contributes a framework: Sustainable User eXperiences Enabled Human-centered (SUXEH) framework that promotes to actively support human psychological needs by providing guidelines on how to model the fundamental psychological needs as explicit system functionalities in the early stages of the software systems development process. The framework does so in a way that eases the integration of sustainable user experience aspects (mediated by the human needs) in the systems design phase of the overall development process.

  abstract  = {Business process modeling and system dynamics are different approaches that are used in the design and management of organizations. Both approaches are concerned with the processes in, and around, organizations with the aim to identify, design and understand their behavior as well as potential improvements. At the same time, these approaches differ considerably in their methodological focus. While business process modeling specifically takes the (control flow of) business processes as its primary focus, system dynamics takes the analysis of complex and multi-faceted systems as its core focus. More explicitly combining both approaches has the potential to better model and analyze (by way of simulation) complex business processes, while specifically also including more relevant facets from the environment of these business processes. Furthermore, the inherent ability for simulation of system dynamics models, can be used to simulate the behavior of processes over time, while also putting business processes in a broader multi-faceted context. In this paper, we report on initial results on making such a more explicit combination of business process modeling and system dynamics. In doing so, we also provide a step-by-step guide on how to use BPMN based models and system dynamics models together to model and analyze complex business processes, while illustrating this in terms of a case study on the maintenance of building facades.},

These methods should provide accurate and efficient High-Dimensional Model Representations of stochastic results using a reasonable number of calculations. Therefore, the PCE–HDMR approach (Polynomial Chaos Expansion–High-Dimensional Model Representation) is utilized to qualify appropriate UQ methods for large-scale computations in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. This technique is a combination of Cut-HDMR, a hierarchical decomposition modeling approach, with PCE. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the PCE–HDMR methodology in conjunction with complementary modeling techniques is applied for the UQ analysis of a buoyancy-driven mixing process between two miscible fluids within the Differentially Heated Cavity of aspect ratio 4. The results include a thorough probabilistic representation of time-dependent response quantities that comprehensively describe the mixing process. The stochastic models are derived from Large Eddy Simulations using PCE–HDMR and the Sparse Grid Method, which serves as a reference for the results from PCE–HDMR. The results show that PCE–HDMR provides accurate statistics of the modeled time-dependent stochastic processes and shows good agreement with the reference results. Thus, PCE–HDMR indicates great potential for UQ of technical-scale computations due to its efficiency and flexibility in the construction of stochastic models.},

Additionally, visualization simulations using software like Swarm evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness. The experiment demonstrates that this method can quickly reach a consensus and accurately detect potential risks, which will greatly contribute to establishing future credit systems.},

  abstract  = {Mechanical shock testing utilizing different types of resonating fixtures is an aerospace environmental testing practice useful in simulating mid-field pyroshock. Qualification tests using these methods may be specified in single or multiple test axes, with each axis performed individually or sometimes all at once. Simple structures such as bars, beams, and plates have been used to repeatably perform single-axis resonant shock tests, while plates of varying sizes along with a 90 degree bracket have been used to perform tests that meet all axes requirements in a single shock test event. This work will evaluate a different fixture concept, used in conjunction with a resonant plate. The fixture is designed to create a controlled resonant response in two axes, which when combined with the plate motion in the third axis can achieve a repeatable resonant shock response in all axes at once, with minimal setup time or operator trial and error. Modal properties of a combined fixture and plate assembly are used as performance objectives for the fixture design. Finite element modeling is used to evaluate and modify the fixture design. A fixture is then fabricated and tested in several configurations to evaluate modal response characteristics, shock response performance, and the performance of the model when predicting those quantities of interest.},

Current approaches to designing for trustworthiness often neglect the socio-technical perspective, ignoring user perceptions and the multifaceted nature of trust. The study aims to identify and conceptualise factors that influence perceptions of the trustworthiness of STS and contribute to designing trustworthy technologies. We implemented a mixed-method study with a qualitative emphasis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 31 participants over two iterations, supplemented by observation and a survey featuring psychometric scales and open questions. Employing grounded theory techniques, including iterative coding, writing memos, and a research journal, we propose the ‘Socio-Technical Trustworthiness’ (SoTechTrust) framework, which includes requirements to understand trust issues and a list of factors perceived as trustworthy by individuals, which we conceptualised in design recommendations to be used in socio-technical context to ensure trustworthiness.},

A very complex task for developers is the analysis of robotic systems’ behavior, which is required to ensure trustworthy interaction with the surrounding environment. Available analysis techniques, like field tests, depend on human observations, while automated techniques, like formal analysis, suffer from the complexity of the systems. Recent works show the applicability of process mining for the analysis of event data generated by robots to increase the understanding of system behavior. However, robots produce data at such a low granularity that process mining cannot provide a meaningful description of the system’s behavior. We tackle this problem by proposing a process mining-based methodology to prepare and analyze the data coming from the execution of a robotic system. The methodology supports the system developer in producing an event log compliant with process mining techniques and is used to analyze multiple perspectives of robots’ behavior. We implemented the methodology in a tool supporting its phases. We use the tool on a robotic smart agriculture scenario to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the methodology.},

Territoriality’s special qualities may have a direct and significant influence on the effectiveness of organizational business collaboration, besides fostering the development of local knowledge to support organizational collaboration indirectly. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore how organisational territoriality characteristics affect the efficiency of collaborative networks. To achieve this goal, we propose a method called Territorial Feature Dimension Mining Method Based on Business (TFD-B) on the basis of the Collaborative Context Metamodel. Firstly, when building the collaborative network, the unique business scenario factors of organizational collaboration are taken into account completely. Subsequently, we conduct further mining and sorting to identify the territorial factors that might have an impact on the collaborative network. Finally, the State Grid Power Supply Company is used as a real case to validate the methodology, and we employ QAP analysis to quantitatively investigate the specific influence relationship between these characteristics and the efficiency of the collaborative network. The main contribution of this study is the proposed TFD-B method, which effectively mines the territorial characteristics affecting collaborative networks at the business level.},

  abstract  = {The need for academic case studies to train the workforce on digital engineering is the driving motivation for this research. In this context, a “case study” is a realistic but fictitious set of documents and models in a digital environment that allows students to gain “hands-on” experience in the classroom. The US Department of Defense (DoD) released a strategy in 2018 that includes the need for training as a pillar for implementing digital engineering. The research represented here strives to advance digital engineering curricula. In the past, the research team has published and presented a vision for the Simulation Training Environment for Digital Engineering (STEDE) that includes a description of plans to leverage case studies to advance student knowledge relative to the Digital Engineering Competency Framework (DECF). The research plan for this work introduces the notion of the Bulldog unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system and associated mission as one of the case studies (Bulldog is a fictitious unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system used to detect and clear obstacles. The Bulldog models originated with the Defense Acquisition University (DAU). Originally developed using traditional acquisition artifacts in support of DAU’s systems engineering courses, these artifacts have been digitized using SysML and the Cameo tool to support digital acquisition training. DAU is continuing to evolve these models to support hands-on learning throughout the DAU curriculum. The SERC is supporting this evolution for DAU training as well as using Bulldog for research purposes. We greatly appreciate the partnership with DAU, in particular the efforts of David Pearson, James Roche, John Snoderly, Robert Raygan, Troy Snow, John Quintana, Aaron Jacobson, and Robert Arthur.). A past research article discussed the preliminary usage of Bulldog for curriculum on digital (acquisition) artifacts, such as the systems engineering plan (SEP). This research asserts that digital engineering curricula should include facets of the current state (text-based artifacts), digitization (conversion of text to models), digitalization (reconceptualization that takes advantage of the power of data and models), and a serialization of the transformation. This article provides insights into our digital transformation of the Bulldog case study and a simple example of the serialized transformation of operational scenarios from text-based to model-based formats.},

  abstract  = {Electrical impedance technology (EIT) is a portable functional imaging approach with exciting potential in a wide range of industries. The electrical conductivity of biological tissues is often treated as isotropic in the currently popular electrical impedance imaging approaches. In actuality, there is a noticeable anisotropy in the electrical conductivity of different biological tissues, and this anisotropy has a substantial impact on the imaging result. This work offers an electrical impedance imaging method based on transformation media theory that enables anisotropic impedance imaging of tissues in order to further explore this idea. A quasi-conformal mapping transformation modifies anisotropic conductivity and corresponding isotropic conductivity inside a virtual coordinate system. The accuracy of the anisotropic to isotropic transformation is confirmed by a comparison using finite element analysis between the electrical signals, electric field intensity, and current density produced by various types of anisotropic conductivity models and their corresponding trans-formed isotropic conductivity models. This work inverts the conductivity of the analogous isotropic model using the LBP algorithm, Land-Weber algorithm, and Thinknov algorithm. Additionally, it conforms to the limitations of the transformational connection while achieving the representation of anisotropic conductivity.},

  abstract  = {Opposite to standard use of Overall Equipment Effectiveness as a tool to optimize production efficiency, this article delves into the innovative application of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) as a tool for enhancing stability and continuity in manufacturing environments. Traditionally, OEE has been a metric for measuring manufacturing efficiency, focusing on three critical aspects: Availability, Performance, and Quality. However, this paper proposes a reinterpretation of OEE, transforming it from a static metric to a dynamic, probabilistic measure. This shift in perspective is rooted in the integration of discrete mathematics and probability theory, offering an approach to understanding and optimizing production systems, in comparing each system to their Digital Twin or even lines with same families of products. The article begins by exploring the traditional aspects of OEE and its role in identifying production inefficiencies. It then introduces a novel framework for OEE, redefining it as a probability measure that encapsulates the likelihood of achieving ideal manufacturing conditions. This redefinition is followed by a detailed examination of how this probabilistic approach can be practically applied in manufacturing settings, particularly in the context of digital twins and varied production systems. By reinterpreting OEE through this new lens, the article aims to provide a more standardized and comparative framework, facilitating a better understanding and enhancement of production efficiency.},

Leveraging the refinement of component and object-oriented systems (rCOS) as a framework, we provide an overview of these formal theories and discuss their relationships. We intend to express a vision that different theories and methods are required for different aspects in a CBSD process, and also different formal theories are required even for a particular aspect. However, ensuring their consistent application remains a major challenge and this is a main barrier to the effective industry adoption of CBSD. Furthermore, we delineate emerging challenges and prospects associated with integrating formal methods for modelling and design human-cyber-physical systems (HCPS) - hybrid integration encompassing cyber systems, physical systems, and the mixed human and machine intelligence.},

This piece of software, which works as a complement to traditional controlled exposure therapy facilitated by a clinical psychologist, aims to bridge the playful, immersive, and flow experiences that are naturally embedded in VR-mediated video games as a way to ease patient adoption and increase the effectiveness of the social reinsertion program. Our preliminary results show that the conceived application was perceived as highly valuable by multidisciplinary specialists working in burn recovery programs, highlighting the rehabilitation and social reinsertion possibilities that a VR-mediated video game can support as well as how it effectively integrates alongside conventional controlled exposure therapy programs.},

For example, common and widespread assets, that are typically created as part of video game development are Non-Player Characters (NPCs).

We theorize that a reproduction of the actions of NPCs within the game (i.e., simulations) holds key information for Game Software Engineering (GSE) tasks such as Traceability Link Recovery (TLR). This paper presents our approach for supporting TLR in GSE by leveraging video game simulations. Simulation data from NPCs is used to reduce the search space. Since the reduced search space might still be too large for manual inspection, an evolutionary TLR procedure evolves a population of code fragments. As a result, a ranking of code fragments that map the requirement to the code is obtained. We evaluate our approach in Kromaia, a commercial video game released on PC and PlayStation 4. We compare our approach against a baseline that does not incorporate simulations by means of a statistical analysis. Our approach reduces the search space by 99.21},

  abstract  = {Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of aerospace systems is growing more complex. Current verification and validation (V   V) approaches and processes are not adequate to cope with the evolving GNC architectures and topologies being driven by autonomy. To address this, several space agencies (NASA, ESA, DLR, CNES) and the French research center ONERA sponsored a series of seminars and a workshop, presented from fall 2020 to spring 2021. To mobilize the GNC workforce, this white paper summarizes the workshop outcomes, identifies available tools and existing gaps in V   V capability, and suggests a prioritization of tool and method development needs for V   V of advanced GNC algorithms. Several major emerging themes were recognized and examined: state-of-the-art tools being developed mostly in academic research settings; education and awareness within the GNC work force, creating opportunities to address the most urgent V   V gaps; increasingly autonomous systems that still require assurance; formal software verification that has progressed enough to apply to online flight software; NASA’s advances in V   V and certification for airplanes—processes that can be a roadmap for spacecraft applications; and short-term needs for the formulation and release of relevant V   V benchmark problems as a practical way forward. The opportunities provided by the joint resolution of specific V   V benchmark problems can help close the development gap between academia and industry while gradually tightening the awareness gap. This provides a good basis for further discussions with the goal of converging to a consensus white paper for GNC V   V.},

  abstract  = {Designing learning games for the retention of declarative knowledge is a way to provide learners with a large variety of adapted training situations. Such training situations can be considered as game activities built upon questioned facts. Learners must then face various game situations wherein interactive elements and rules are a means to read and answer specific questions about these facts. This chapter is an extended version of [ 18 ]. We propose Roguelite as a relevant game genre for declarative knowledge training. Indeed, its core design principles tackle the needs of variety and challenging training situations. Additionally, we propose an analysis framework to help teachers and game developers in identifying the key elements to design training games. This framework includes a set of questions to consider during the preliminary design of any training game for declarative knowledge. We identified and used this proposal in a specific research context about the training of multiplication tables. Following an iterative and prototype-centered approach, we illustrate two iterations about applying the analysis framework to guide the design and development of playable prototypes.},

Focusing on the direct usability challenges faced during ENCORE’s development, an extension to the ENCORE meta-model is proposed. This enhancement ensures uniform representation, empowering educators to seamlessly integrate and utilize OERs in personalized learning paths and assessments. Beyond conventional classrooms, the extended meta-model fosters community awareness through collaborative material sharing.

However, effective control of the transition stage, which plays an important role in reducing the time to reach a new steady state, still lacks research. Here, we utilize a nominal linear system with a time delay to characterize the transition stage. We introduce two state feedback mechanisms, namely linear matrix inequality based state-feedback robust controller and parameter-tuning controller based on nonlinear matrix inequality, into control process. Results of both genetic algorithms simulations and closed-loop control experiments show that these controllers dramatically shorten the transition stage compared to open-loop control. Furthermore, we find that parameter-tuning controller outperforms linear matrix inequality based state-feedback robust controller in terms of both stable time and steady error. These results are robust to different experimental settings. From industrial economic perspective, this technology could help to conserve energy and protect environment.},

A reconfigurable system transitions from one mode to another during its operation to adapt its behavior to the relevant environment. By including such a feature, RDESs become complex and are often costly in terms of computation time and memory. The verification of RDESs consists of two main steps: state space generation and state space analysis. In order to improve these two steps, we propose in this paper, a new approach for verifying system properties that is performed on a developed distributed architecture. The proposed approach allows to avoid redundant computation and reduce execution time by considering the relationships between properties and creating a parallel algorithm that ensures a suitable execution order for each property that is not costly and efficient. The proposed approach is evaluated by exploiting a case study that illustrates the impact of using this approach. The results demonstrate the significance of this paper.},

  abstract  = {Our overall research topics are self-organising multi-agent systems (MAS). Here, we study how to design MAS architectures, which implement adaptivity using the MAPE pattern (monitor, analyse, plan, execute). We investigate the approach of organisation-oriented MAS (Org-MAS), where one considers large-scale and agent-independent aspects of MAS, like roles, norms, positions, interaction protocols etc. When considering adaptivity in the context of Org-MAS we are confronted with two perspectives: On the one side we have the micro-level, where the agents adapt their behaviour; and on the other side we have the macro-level, where the organisation changes the network of positions, role obligations etc. We like to point out that these two perspectives are not independent from each other. This mutual adaption of the agents and the system’s structure is known as the micro-macro link . We consider the adequate modelling of the micro-macro link as an essential precondition for the design of MAPE-loops in Org-MAS since due to this mutual dependencies, the Org-MAS is more than the sum of its parts and a model that does not take them into account (or even relies one perspective only) will provide less accurate predictions about adaption effects. So, our research challenge is (1) to integrate these two perspectives – micro and macro – into the MAPE-loop with equal rights and (2) to take the micro-macro link intoi account. Here, we define the Sonar -MAPE-loop, i.e. a design for a micro-macro aware adaption.},

  abstract  = {Japan has faced many severe earthquakes in the last three decades. These earthquakes provided us with various lessons. The present paper addresses the overall consideration of earthquake ground motion generation, from the fault rupture, through the wave propagation in the deeper rock, to the near-surface soil amplification to explain how these great earthquakes led to severe damage to buildings. The soil-structure interaction (SSI) is used in explaining how the damage occurred during severe ground shaking. These earthquake ground motions are often above the design level for high-rise buildings. These intense ground motions, containing unusual features, should be considered in the design of important buildings. These observations lead to a consideration of a philosophy of resilience-based design (RBD) that is addressed in the present paper. While the conventional earthquake-resistant design philosophy is to upgrade the resistance against earthquake inputs, as a result of the intense ground motions described above, the emerging design philosophy is to improve both the resistance and recovery. Some examples of RBD are presented by using buildings with passive structural control systems. Future directions of RBD using innovative structural design technologies are presented.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes an interactive tool to remotely debug, control, and monitor controllers designed using IOPT Petri nets. The controllers run on physical hardware devices using code automatically generated from a Petri net model. A web-based user interface allows remote controllers to analyze, test, and debug, present a graphical view of the original Petri net model, and mark an evolution in quasi-real-time. Debugging capabilities include execution pausing, step-by-step execution and continuous execution, and the definition of break-points associated with transition firing. Users may remotely force values on input signals and inspect the values of output signals to test conditions that would otherwise require physical interaction with the hardware systems. The tool records the evolution of all signals and state variables. These are presented as waveforms, and the respective data can be exported, allowing posterior analysis with external tools of systems running at high-speed execution rates, The tool is already integrated into the IOPT-Tools framework, runs in a standard web browser, and does not require additional software installation. The tool employs a lightweight protocol based on HTTP to communicate with the code running on the embedded controllers. The protocol was designed to minimize CPU, memory, and bandwidth resources. Thus, the controller code generated automatically by the IOPT-Tools framework includes a minimal HTTP server for communication with the debugger tool running on a browser.

  abstract  = {The physical and design aspects of buildings, the availability of urban infrastructures and services, and the presence of landscape amenities significantly influence consumer preferences for residential living spaces. Capturing these preferences can provide insights on spatial changes in consumer behavior. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel methodological framework that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with geospatial data analysis, focusing particularly on insights derived from real estate listings. This innovative approach enables an in-depth examination of urban market dynamics by allowing for a comprehensive analysis that includes temporal shifts and spatial differences. By employing advanced analytical techniques, such as lexical analysis of listings and geospatial exploration, the framework is designed to decode complex market narratives and uncover detailed consumer preferences. The methodological framework of this paper aims to construct a comprehensive model by integrating textual, spatial, and temporal data from listings, thereby offering a complete perspective of the urban real estate market. The integration of these diverse data sources from real estate listings provides critical insights into consumer preferences and market trends, equipping stakeholders with essential information to make informed decisions. Ultimately, this approach not only broadens the understanding of the real estate market but also aids stakeholders in crafting strategic initiatives that align with the sector’s evolving demands. This method facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning in the real estate domain by leveraging the rich data found in property listings.},

  abstract  = {This article identifies a scientific mapping on developing digital transformation publications in SMEs. Publications related to digital transformation in SMEs are still not popular enough. The trend of digital transformation publications has increased significantly starting in 2019, along with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. It takes the development of scientific knowledge to explain, predict, and control the dynamic ability to adapt in the digital 4.0 era. Bibliometric analysis was used to analyse articles from Scopus, Emerald, Springer, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases. Through bibliometric analysis, the development of studies regarding digital transformation and the latest trends in this study is known. The search results using Publish or Perish from 2000 to 2022 found 529 articles. The co-occurrence analysis resulted in 3,011 keywords derived from titles and abstracts. After being limited to 3 occurrences of keywords and removing words that were considered irrelevant, 116 keywords were obtained, which were divided into 11 clusters. The results of the bibliometric analysis help develop the digital transformation research field for SMEs through trend visualisation. The results of the analysis provide variable recommendations for further research. The analysis results help find scientific mapping and future research directions related to digital transformation.},

To date, approaches to story sifting have been either: manual, with the burden of authoring sifting patterns; or automated, but of limited efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings via a novel approach that recasts the problem as one of object detection. We demonstrate how an object detection model can be trained to detect story arcs of prominent story types emerging from an interactive virtual storyworld which can occur anywhere in the storyworld’s timeline. We evaluate our approach using synthetic virtual story environments that show our approach is able to: detect story arcs anywhere in the storyworld’s timeline with a high degree of accuracy and more efficiently than the state-of-the-art Arc Sift , making it scalable in real-time.},

  abstract  = {Traffic state prediction is a regression problem of predicting traffic states such as travel speed, volume, occupancy and density. However, we observe that existing traffic state prediction models are often trained and tested on non-perturbed traffic scenarios. It lacks the robustness needed for handling perturbed traffic scenarios. This work addresses this gap in the stated problem statement using simulated data based on perturbed traffic scenarios. Through this work, we established the need to assess the performance of the regression models on the affected road segments rather than on the entire road network. In doing so, the performance of the regression models on the perturbed traffic scenarios has become apparent. In addition, we have confirmed that it helps to train the regression model using a mixture of traffic data from both types of traffic scenarios. For our experiments, we built a micro-simulation of a medium-sized traffic network based on the morning peak traffic scenario. We evaluated multiple regression models for multiple prediction horizons on the studied traffic scenarios. Our results based on the affected road segments reveal that Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has the best mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for all prediction horizons. Hence, it is established that ST-GCN is a more robust regression model for predicting traffic states under perturbed and non-perturbed traffic scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Patient pathway has become a key concept in the organization of healthcare. However, the materialization and operationalization of pathways often focus on work processes of health personnel, clinical decision-making, and deadlines, contradicting the strong patient-oriented perspective that is inherent in their definition. In this paper, we introduce a patient-centered perspective of kidney cancer pathways, reporting on a dual-perspective strategy to map and model patient pathways. Utilizing a multi-method approach, we map and model pathways from the perspectives of both healthcare personnel and patients and investigate the feasibility of the Customer Journey Modeling Language (CJML) for modeling patient pathways. To prevent confusion, the planned pathway as seen from the hospital perspective and the actual pathway experienced by the patient are referred to as ‘pathway’ and ‘journey’, respectively. In the paper, we describe methods to engage with healthcare professionals and patients to collect the necessary information to create precise models, and we show how precise modeling of patient pathways requires the integration of several information sources. Moreover, the study underlines the value of examining pathways from a dual perspective, as the two perspectives corroborate and supplement each other, illustrating the complexity of patient journeys. Finally, the findings provide insights into the feasibility of CJML, firstly underlining that the usefulness of visual models is context-dependent, and secondly, suggesting that the methods and subsequent visualizations may be useful as organizational, instructional, and communicative tools.},

  abstract  = {Microservices have emerged as an architectural style, where software architectures are broken up into loosely coupled components or services that can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, operated, and upgraded independently. Thus many companies are re-architecting monolithic systems with microservices-based architecture to improve quality attributes (QA) such as scalability and performance. Once the refactoring is concluded, designers have to evaluate whether the expectations raised regarding quality attributes are met. This evaluation must be done in controlled environments and involves knowing the ecosystem used for deployment, as well as the available tools for monitoring and workload generation. In this paper, we present the MiMoQ tool for experimentation of microservice-based applications, which are deployed in Kubernetes. MiMoQ (Microservices Metrics of Quality) aims to facilitate the development of the experimental process, ranging from the generation of workloads to the collection and analysis of metrics, thus freeing experimenters from tasks such as the selection, installation, configuration, and integration of different types of tools for monitoring and workload generation. In this way, performance analysts can focus on the design of experiments, analysis of results, and continuous improvement of applications.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {As the automotive industry continues its rapid evolution to fully autonomous driving, automakers and suppliers are working to develop safe and advanced autonomous features while maintaining costs that are acceptable to the consumer. Efficiently integrating multiple sub-systems to support this transformation provides opportunities for optimizing performance and cost. A stowable steering column assembly integrated with a steer-by-wire handwheel actuator is one example of such an integration opportunity. While a traditional power-actuated steering column enhances driver comfort by providing relatively minor adjustments to the steering wheel location, a stowable steering column transforms a vehicle cockpit during an autonomous steering mode by significantly moving the steering wheel out of a driver’s way. This transformation is further enhanced when integrated with a steer-by-wire handwheel actuator, which enables technology like Quiet Wheel™ Steering, where the steering wheel does not rotate during vehicle lateral motion. While there are significant benefits of implementing a stowable steering column with a steer-by-wire system, it comes with many challenges. These challenges include creating a mechanical design to provide the large movements required for stowing the steering wheel, maintaining typical steering column performance constraints such as natural frequency, stiffness, and acoustic performance, achieving the desired stow path and speeds, and fitting the steering column assembly hardware within a vehicle’s packaging space environment. Other electrical design challenges include thermal management, system packaging, fail-operational performance, pinch detection, software function partitioning, diagnostics, software throughput, and safety. These challenges provide additional opportunities for hardware cost reduction, optimized validation effort, and implementation of advanced software features. Strategic planning between an OEM and a supplier helps mitigate and address these challenges.},

  abstract  = {The complexity of modern-day supply chains makes logistics operations more vulnerable towards disturbances, which endangers sustainability goals in the short-term. Local disturbances might effect logistics at large, as we typically see in congested urban areas. As a consequence, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining attention as a novel paradigm that promotes interconnected networks of context-aware electronic devices used for remote monitoring and control. These capabilities may stimulate anticipatory behaviour and more resilient supply chains, but a clear framework prescribing which objects to empower with electronic devices is still lacking. In this paper, we aim to semantically bridge the resilience and IoT paradigms in logistics environments. The ontology is developed by means of a bibliometric- and systematic literature study in search of essential concepts, and a field study to evaluate the ontology’s effectiveness. Our ontology can form the basis to enhance resilience by replacing risk assessments with condition-based control mechanisms, resulting in better cooperation between human and software agents to resolve disturbances quicker, and more accurate training of machine learning algorithms in favour of autonomous decision making.},

Concurrent security of the signing protocol is required to thwart denial-of-service attacks. We present a concurrently secure blind-signing protocol for Schnorr signatures, using the standard primitives NIZK and PKE and assuming that Schnorr signatures themselves are unforgeable. Our protocol is the first to be compatible with standard Schnorr implementations over 256-bit elliptic curves. We cast our scheme as a generalization of blind and partially blind signatures: we introduce the notion of predicate blind signatures , in which the signer can define a predicate that the blindly signed message must satisfy. We provide implementations and benchmarks for various choices of primitives and scenarios, such as blindly signing Bitcoin transactions only when they meet certain conditions specified by the signer.},

  abstract  = {The ship-mounted crane is a typical system for completing marine projects, which often need to work in complex sea conditions. Besides, it has complex nonlinearity and is also a typical underdrive system. These factors increase the difficulty of the controller design. Traditional control strategies based on gravity compensation are mostly used in full-drive systems, which can effectively reduce the influence of gravity uncertainty on the system positioning error and save driving energy. However, the actuator oscillation problem of underdrive systems, such as the swing of the payload of ship-mounted crane systems, has not been fully solved. This paper proposes an adaptive swing suppression controller based on the gravity compensation of a (3-DOF) ship-mounted boom crane. Specifically, the influence of gravity on system stability is reduced by estimating unknow gravity parameters through adaptive functions. Combine the swing angle information of the payload with the control output to eliminate the remaining swing of the payload. The auxiliary term in the controller reduces the difficulty of subsequent stability analysis, and also has a certain resistance effect to steady-state oscillation. Next, with the help of the Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle’s invariance theorem, the proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is completed. Finally, this paper verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control method successively through numerical simulations, and the simulation data has the potential to improve the robustness of the proposed controller in different marine environments.},

For this reason, shear tensile tests on clinched joints under impact load application are to be carried out and evaluated with regard to their load-bearing capacities within the scope of this work using the aluminum alloy EN AW-6014 T4. In addition, the influence of plastic preforming of the parts to be joined is investigated. Furthermore, corresponding numerical investigations are carried out, for which the strain rate dependency of the material's plasticity is first characterized experimentally and implemented in the material model. Subsequently, the experimentally and numerically determined load-bearing capacities of the clinched joints are compared and discussed.},

  abstract  = {Rational logistics design is fundamental for successful economic cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union supplying mechanical engineering products. Such aspects will additionally allow countries with expanding economies to determine conditions for building effective logistics in the European market. The growing needs of potential European consumers for mechanical engineering products are due to an increase in demand for cheap semifinished products and components with an inexpensive supply cost. Trade statistics between European countries and Ukraine indicate, in particular, demand increasing for Ukrainian commodities over the past four years. Therefore, logistics chain specifics design requires organizers to identify all conflict situations and risks. The paper highlights a detailed study of technological processes in context relationships between all participants in supply chains. In research, several alternative scenarios are proposed to organize supply chains for mechanical engineering products. The variants set consider each participant's capabilities: technical characteristics, technology features for performing operations, and resistance to risk situations. The perspective algorithm has been proposed to design supply logistics options for mechanical engineering products and created analytical models that consider the impact of random processes on operations execution. Thus, risks rate and failures are also considered at each stage of supply chains. The authors obtained nonlinear and linear models to predict the amount of supply. The influence level of random environmental factors was determined on delivery efficiency according to the restrictions system. Various scenarios of effective management decisions can be proposed based on the results of supply chain modeling for mechanical engineering products.},

Presently, robotic welding is utilized to improve efficiency and productivity as well as quality. The robot is interfaced with welding machine by their controllers. Therefore, welding process with proper parameters is controlled by robot routing as well as the heat accumulative can be control by the robotic welding process control. In general, the weld line is inspected by destruction or non-destruction. However, such approach is expensive and time consuming.

  abstract  = {The expanding hardware diversity in high performance computing adds enormous complexity to scientific software development. Developers who aim to write maintainable software have two options: 1) To use a so-called data locality abstraction that handles portability internally, thereby, performance-productivity becomes a trade off. Such abstractions usually come in the form of libraries, domain-specific languages, and run-time systems. 2) To use generic programming where performance, productivity and portability are subject to software design. In the direction of the second, this work describes a design approach that allows the integration of low-level and verbose programming tools into high-level generic algorithms based on template meta-programming in C++ . This enables the development of performance-portable applications targeting host-device computer architectures, such as CPUs and GPUs. With a suitable design in place, the extensibility of generic algorithms to new hardware becomes a well defined procedure that can be developed in isolation from other parts of the code. That allows scientific software to be maintainable and efficient in a period of diversifying hardware in HPC. As proof of concept, a finite-difference modelling algorithm for the acoustic wave equation is developed and benchmarked using roofline model analysis on Intel Xeon Gold 6248 CPU, Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU, and AMD MI100 GPU.},

To address this issue, we introduce a proactive runtime deployment optimization method for multi-stage microservices, aiming to ensure both resource efficiency and QoS. Our proposed method encompasses four interrelated modules–forecasting, constraint planning, judgment selection, and execution–which collaboratively work towards optimizing runtime resource allocation, generating viable deployment plans, and identifying cost-efficient solutions without compromising QoS. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed proactive deployment optimization method can potentially reduce computational resource usage by 35},

The overall objective of this systematic literature review is to explore the literature to assess the breadth of possibilities for analyzing emotions to understand workers’ decision-making behaviors, based on data collected in industrial settings. The analysis of 29 articles extracted from the Compendex and Web of Science search engines allowed us to define the emotional factors measured in the analysis of human decision-making behavior, the tools used, and the sectors of application. The subject is still in its infancy for the scientific community and is a source of excitement. The results of the qualitative analysis of the articles show the predominance of text analysis (social networks and/or online reviews) for sentiment analysis. The tools used within the technology are very diverse (deep learning, machine learning, mathematical models). The same is true for the sectors of activity, although there is a particular interest in customer emotions for marketing purposes in the service industries. Finally, future research avenues are proposed, such as the analysis of the impact of emotions on the decision-making process in manufacturing is practically absent from the study.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to satisfy not only safety, but they also shall achieve specific goals, e.g., stopping at a particular location on a shoulder lane of a highway for an emergency evacuation while avoiding collisions. The Goal-Aware Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (GA-RSS) framework was proposed to derive control strategies guaranteed to satisfy safety and goal achievement. This framework extends RSS rules, originally designed for safety in basic traffic situations, with a program logic allowing to reason on goal achievements in complex situations. In [ 11 ], the Event-B proof-based formal method was used to design a correct-by-construction model of the whole AV controller with a safety architecture and control strategies derived with the GA-RSS framework. This work is extended to handle liveness properties, which are extensively used to model complex goals and achieving them employing the EB4EB reflexive meta-modelling framework. As a result, relying on the EB4EB meta-model, an on-the-fly verification of temporal properties such as deadlock-freeness and goal reachability has been formalised and performed for advanced reasoning. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates additional strengths of the EB4EB meta-modelling approach, such as improvement of modelling and proof understandability and reusability.},

  abstract  = {The solution to finding optimal product delivery variants is always relevant. The best supply chain scheme choice is essential for long-distance transportation of specific cargoes, such as vehicles and spare parts. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to establish the dependence between the cost of delivery of automotive products on the technological and economic parameters of the provision of transport services. This approach made it possible to select the best supply chain option based on the minimum unit cost value during shipping vehicles and spare parts in containers from the USA to Ukraine. Improvement of operations determining the interaction of different kinds of transport, as well as achieving the optimal level of distribution of goods between them, allows the development of timely rational management decisions, significantly increasing the quality and efficiency of the supply chains. The study used mathematical modeling as the primary tool to achieve goals. The designed model includes several cost parameters that characterize specific conditions of certain transportation schemes. Unit cost values were compared to determine the most efficient option from the proposed ones. The most effective option is Supply Chain 3 because it has minimal values of unit costs in most tests of the experiment. The newly developed regression models give a universal mathematical tool by which researchers can choose an effective option of supply chains for delivering vehicles and their repair parts in containers. This approach can assess other distribution channels with the same or analog conceptions of route designing.},

Currently, there are only a few tools that can test programs without source code on Windows. The state-of-art WinAFL tool suffers from the poor testing efficiency. Most of the other tools rely on analysing the source code on Linux. Concolic execution based on binary code is an efficient method to discover defects in program without source code. In this paper, we present WinTaintCE, which mainly uses Rich Instrument-based taint analysis technique for instruction refinement. The data in the input file of fuzzing tasks will be marked as the tainted source. All instructions that are flowing through tainted data will be extracted for symbolic execution. However, this step will overlook many instructions for calculating non tainted data. Thus, we innovatively propose Rich Instrument technology, which saves the values on all registers and memory addresses involved in an instruction to a trace file. During concolic execution based on that trace file, those saved values will be set directly for non tainted data in an instruction. Experimental results show that WinTaintCE can explore about 24},

A major driver of this change is virtualisation, which allows computing resources to be deployed on a large scale. However, traditional DCs, with their network topology and proliferation of network endpoints, are struggling to meet the flexible, centrally managed requirements of cloud computing applications. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) promise to offer a solution to these growing networking requirements by separating control functions from data routing. This shift adds more flexibility to networks but also introduces new security issues. This article presents a framework for evaluating security of SDN architectures. In addition, through an experimental study, we demonstrate how this framework can identify the threats and vulnerabilities, calculate their risks and severity, and provide the necessary measures to mitigate them.

  abstract  = {Mental health applications (apps) have been increasingly developed to assist users to improve their mental and emotional well-being using various persuasive strategies. Although research has shown that using a single strategy in persuasive technology design can be effective, it is a common practice for designers to employ multiple strategies in their persuasive intervention design. However, the comparative effectiveness of using multiple persuasive strategies versus a single strategy in mental health apps has not been empirically investigated. To answer this question, we developed two versions of a Gratitude app to promote positive mental health and emotional well-being. The first version incorporates multiple persuasive strategies, while the second version incorporates a single strategy. We conducted a 5-week field study of 84 participants, followed by a one-on-one interview with 16 participants. The results show that overall, the Gratitude app is effective with respect to the motivational appeal toward promoting mental and emotional well-being. More importantly, employing multiple strategies in the app improves its effectiveness with respect to the motivational appeal compared to employing a single strategy. Moreover, there are gender differences in motivational appeal across the two versions of the app. Finally, interview data provided more insights, showing that participants appreciated the simplicity of the app and how the app helps them improve their mental and emotional well-being.},

  abstract  = {In this study, the crack propagation behavior for the uniform wing spar and tapered wing spar with and without an intermediate cap was compared. Optimization of the I cross-section of integral aluminum 2024-T3 wing spar is presented, taking the maximum fatigue life as the criterion. Toward this aim, finite element method (FEM) is used to stimulate crack growth in I-beam. The stress intensity factor was calculated using fracture mechanics in ANSYS software. Life cycles and damages were calculated and compared to increase the efficient fatigue life of the spar. Wing spars with intermediate caps may extend light aircraft fatigue life; according to this study, top web and intermediary caps are intact, while the bottom cap usually fractures and fails. Analysis that was carried out showed that FEM could be an efficient and cost-beneficial tool for the simulation of crack propagation in three-dimensional structures like wing spars. The findings also suggest that engineers can better predict and optimize wing spar fatigue life by using FEM and ANSYS software during design and evaluation. This method increases aerospace structure safety, reliability, cost savings, and performance.},

  abstract  = {Logic programming is based on defining relations. Functions are often considered as syntactic sugar which can be transformed into predicates so that their logic is not used for computational purposes. In this paper, we present a method to use functions to improve the operational behavior of logic programs without loosing the flexibility of logic programming. For this purpose, predicates and goals are transformed into functions and nested expressions. By evaluating these functions in a demand-driven manner wherever possible and taking potential failures into account, we ensure that the execution of the transformed programs will never require more steps than the original programs but can decrease the number of steps—in the best case reducing infinite search spaces to finite ones. Thus, we obtain a systematic method to improve the operational behavior of logic programs without changing their semantics.},

However, the quality of the weld joints has a significant influence on the mechanical properties of the joints. This paper presents an innovative non-destructive inspection technology based on active thermography for assessing the welding quality as a function of the peak load. By employing a frequency-modulated laser heat source, we analyze the thermal signal that traverses the weld joint section. Then, we establish a correlation between welding quality and the information derived from spot size and internal uniformity analysis. Furthermore, the proposed methodology shows potential for in-line testing of resistance spot welding, offering easy automation and enabling the classification of spot-welded joints.},

  abstract  = {The interconnection of HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) transmission has proved its strength in being competent with the HVAC transmission for the bulk amount of power transfer over a large distance. With the adaption of interconnected hybrid systems, there arises the need to develop or modify the existing protection techniques, to protect the interconnected AC-DC system. If a fault occurs on either side in an interconnected VSC-HVDC network, the disturbance may travel to another part of the hybrid network. The transient current has fatal effects on the power electronics devices of the converters of the VSC-HVDC configuration. This may cause failure of switches like diodes, IGBTs, and submodules which are the building blocks of the converter unit. The consecutive result may be the failure of the DC link. This article provides an analysis of the network under DC faults. This study may be helpful in knowing the system behavior so, the protection scheme can be designed accordingly. In this article, the Teager Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) is used to perform the task. This energy spectrum provides a robust and efficient performance to detect the fault with adequate accuracy and faster speed. The current signal signature is noted for the different fault cases. The novelty is established in terms of accurate and efficient fault detection with the proposed technique. For the DC fault transients, the proposed technique proves its potency with the detection speed and accuracy. The proposed network is simulated using the PSCAD/EMTDC and MATLAB platform. The technique proves its efficiency in various tested fault scenarios.},

The active maneuverability of ballistic missiles is weak, so their trajectories have strong regularity and relatively fixed trajectories. Compared with other types of aircraft, high-speed aircraft has higher maneuverability, its flight trajectory is not fixed, and the change law of attack angle and roll angle during flight is very different. In this paper, the observation data is used to fit the acceleration change law of the aircraft, and then the integral iteration method is used to predict its subsequent flight trajectory. Most of the current trajectory prediction research focuses on the improvement of the filtering algorithm. This paper improves the polynomial order of the fitting target acceleration to find the change law of the target trajectory acceleration with time in the short-term trajectory prediction. The simulation results show that in the short term, the acceleration of the target is close to a constant value.},

The results of the experimental investigation were used to feed the FE digital system on the basis of a Monte Carlo simulation. To extend our knowledge of the structural reliability of the system for more configurations the use of less computationally demanding surrogate models was implemented.

Conceptual models are means for complexity reduction in the design and customization of information systems. Legal regulations are important for public organizations as they specify the services that the organizations offer to citizens and businesses. However, the operationalization of legal regulations is challenging because they leave room for interpretation and there is a high number of involved actors. These actors comprise of domain experts and IT experts within a public organization, but also other public organizations on the same or different levels of government. In consequence, there are many actors involved in the operationalization and execution of legal regulations for public services who would benefit from the use of conceptual models. To provide support for these actors, we address the following research goal: Design of a method for the collaborative and semi-automated generation of conceptual model from legal regulations in public organizations. In the course of our design science research approach, we derived requirements for the solution based on interviews with thirteen public officials. We conceptually developed the method and evaluated it with an illustrative scenario and expert interviews with six public officials.

While digitalization involves adopting technologies from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) to transform manufacturing business processes, servitization focuses on shifting from producing physical products to providing integrated solutions in response to customer demands for higher-quality services. Accordingly, digital servitization involves providing solutions through the adoption of digital technologies, requiring a radical transformation of manufacturers’ business models. Simultaneously, there is a call for organizations to reshape their business models, embracing sustainability.

While the homophily model was able to capture both influence and conformity effects based on degree of initial strength in the belief and crystallization of the belief, the similarity-based model always conformed. Both models exhibited initial learning and larger belief updating while settling to a relatively-stable state over time.

These pollutants have threatened the survival and development of human beings. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate if the environment will be impacted by digital finance.

After using provincial municipal level panel data from 2011–2022 in China for empirical analysis, digital finance and the nitrogen footprint are found to have a U-shaped, non-linear correlation. Before food nitrogen footprint reaches the crucial value, digital finance has an inhibitory effect; once it reaches the critical value, it has a promotional effect. Furthermore direct impact of digital finance on residents’ food nitrogen footprint, digital finance mainly affects residents’ food nitrogen footprint through per capita income, i.e. there is mediations effect.},

Due to the increasing possibilities of service and software applications in the provision of solutions, a holistic view of the portfolio is required, in contrast to the widespread focus on physical products. The transformation into a solution provider can only succeed through systematic combinations of product elements with value-added services to create customized solutions. These contribute to longer, more frequent and more intensive use of the physical product, as this is tailored specifically to customer requirements, and thus also to better resource utilization through a longer life cycle.

However, the lack of an overview of all provided services and their contribution to the business’ profit translates into an inability in managing the effectiveness of the business and identifying the reasons why clients are giving up on them after a relatively short period. To overcome this, we designed a modeling toolkit for the fitness industry using the ADOxx fast prototyping platform, to assess the quality of the delivered services, evaluate risks and seek automation possibilities enabled by a knowledge graph that backs up the visual representations. The toolkit can be used by the managers of fitness facilities to obtain a perceived service quality from the customers’ perspective. Capturing the customers’ perceptions is more likely to improve the service creation for fitness and sport activities.},

  abstract  = {Invertible programming languages specify transformations to be run in two directions, such as compression/decompression or encryption/decryption. Two key concepts in invertible programming languages are partial invertibility and local invertibility . Partial invertibility lets invertible code be parameterized by the results of non-invertible code, whereas local invertibility requires all code to be invertible. The former allows for more flexible programming, while the latter has connections to domains such as low-energy computing and quantum computing. We find that existing approaches lack a satisfying treatment of partial invertibility, leaving the connection to local invertibility unclear. In this paper, we identify four core constructs for partially invertible programming, and show how to give them a locally invertible interpretation. We show the expressiveness of the constructs by designing the functional invertible language Kalpis , and show how to give them a locally invertible semantics using the novel arrow combinator language 
$$\textsc {rrArr}$$
 R R A R R —the key idea is viewing partial invertibility as an invertible effect. By formalizing the two systems and giving Kalpis semantics by translation to

Although today’s fast-changing business world poses vast variants of business processes (BPs) alongside uncertainty. This situation requires an agile BPM to manage, maintain, and execute different variants of a BP as well as deal with uncertainties and changes. One of the emphasises of agile BPM is involving stakeholders in the BP lifecycle, which requires a standard approach for all stakeholders to have quick and efficient access to the BP lifecycle to prevent problems like cultural resistance. In order to reach a standard approach, social BPM is an emerging concept that can help the easy and efficient involvement of stakeholders in the BP lifecycle. By inspiring form social BPM, this paper propose a new social media-based BPM platform to deal with different varieties of BP and uncertainties by integrating stakeholders in the BP lifecycle. While the platform eases communication, information exchange, and decision-making among stakeholders; it also eliminates the exchange between design-time and run-time while a change occurs by merging design-time and run-time.},

It has been implemented in a tool that automatically generates different UML models, including package diagrams, component diagrams, component and connector diagrams, and state machine diagrams. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a survey with industrial experts within Micron, that allowed us to assess the accuracy and usefulness of the generated documentation.},

The rationale behind this research is to analyze Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) to elicit useful insights regarding the status and potential of interoperability of existing vocabularies, organized in thematic areas (domains). The goal behind the latter is to identify how semantic interoperability of vocabularies (and datasets which are described by the relevant knowledge schema) could be improved, while the expected outcome is an enhanced overview of the existing knowledge representation in the LOV ecosystem, with emphasis put on domain-specific vocabularies and their reuse. In order to gain a general perspective of the domain-specific vocabularies that currently exist, a mapping between the 13 European Data Portal (EDP) thematic categories and the categorization of LOV was initially performed. Afterwards, an analysis framework to capture the information from this desk-based research was included. The analysis framework included: i) the connections of the identified (from the initial mapping) domain-specific vocabularies to core vocabularies in the LOV ecosystem, ii) the connections of domain-specific vocabularies to vocabularies within the same domain, and iii) the connections of domain-specific vocabularies to the other domains. The previous three dimensions were then combined to create an initial assessment on how reusable and thus, interoperable (and beyond) the vocabularies under analysis were, acting as an indicator for domain interoperability readiness.},

  abstract  = {Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) makes an outstanding contribution to indoor inertial navigation in the era of ubiquitous computing, as it is widely integrated into portable devices. Many prominent works have been proposed by taking gyroscope and accelerometer readings as input to estimate the velocity and orientation. However, most of them focus on the local features of IMU (i.e., single sensor temporal feature or local spatial feature), eventually leading to drift on the trajectory. In this paper, we propose a robust model to mitigate the problem of jitters and drifts in trajectory prediction by exploiting the spatial dependence in accelerometer and gyroscope readings, as well as the contextual relation in motion terms through in-depth analyses of IMU readings. In particular, we design a framework (MSIN) to fuse the local spatial dependence of multiple sensors and incorporate the local spatial and global temporal features by using the multi-head self-attention mechanism. We have conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets and the results show that MSIN achieves a significant improvement in RTE (Relative Trajectory Error) performance, with improvements of up to 6.14},

We address the intricacies of different scenario descriptions and promote the communication of system requirements and operational constraints in the context of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). Ongoing standardization efforts highlight the recognition of the importance of ODDs as a tool to manage the complexity of an ADS in accurately defining operational boundaries and conditions, particularly in structured environments. In line with this, our work explores the conceptual integration of multiple ODDs within an ADS to enable operation across different domains. Drawing on the existing literature on ODD extension concepts and leveraging insights from our research efforts, we strive for exemplary adaptation of operations in unstructured environments such as hybrid mines. A key focus is the translation of a solution that has been successfully tested in the context of hybrid mines and structured terrain into modern ODD frameworks. In particular, we focus on taxonomy as a fundamental element of an ODD framework. Through comparative analysis and evaluation of existing taxonomies, we aim to provide insights into the configuration of ODDs for both structured and unstructured environments, thereby contributing to their broader implementation in the dynamic landscape of autonomous driving technologies.},

However, most of them don’t support multi-instance, which is an important feature of IOPC. The proposed method is designed to fill the research gap. One core of our method is that it sums up multi-instance elements of BPMN collaboration diagram and use Communicating Sequential Programs (CSP#) to formalize them. This formalization focuses on interactions, helps to get precise process execution semantics and makes model verification feasible, avoiding flawed models being translated. The other core is a translation technique based on syntax trees to generate smart contracts from CSP# models. The method is implemented and evaluated in terms of features and cost.},

Modeling spatio-temporal patterns of DMN based on four-dimensional Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Rs-fMRI) provides a basis for exploring spontaneous brain functional activities. However, how to utilize spatio-temporal features to complete the multi-level description of 4D Rs-fMRI with diverse characteristics in the shallow stage of the model and accurately characterize the DMN holistic spatio-temporal patterns remains challenging in the current DMN spatio-temporal patterns modeling. To this end, we propose a Multi-scale Pyramid Attention Network (MPANet) to focus on shallow features and model the spatio-temporal patterns of resting-state personalized DMN. Specifically, in the spatial stage, we design a multi-scale pyramid block in the shallow layer to expand the receptive field and extract granular information at different levels, which realize feature enhancement and guides the model to characterize the DMN spatial pattern. In the temporal stage, parallel guidance from spatial to the temporal pattern is achieved through the fast down-sampling operation and introduction of multi-head attention blocks for a more effective fusion of spatio-temporal features. The results based on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that MPANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. This network presents a robust tool for modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of individuals with DMN, and its exceptional performance suggests promising potential for clinical applications.},

  abstract  = {Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides rich, complementary information for analyzing diseases. However, the practical challenges of acquiring multiple MRI modalities, such as cost, scan time, and safety considerations, often result in incomplete datasets. This affects both the quality of diagnosis and the performance of deep learning models trained on such data. Recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and denoising diffusion models have shown promise in natural and medical image-to-image translation tasks. However, the complexity of training GANs and the computational expense associated with diffusion models hinder their development and application in this task. To address these issues, we introduce a Cross-conditioned Diffusion Model (CDM) for medical image-to-image translation. The core idea of CDM is to use the distribution of target modalities as guidance to improve synthesis quality while achieving higher generation efficiency compared to conventional diffusion models. First, we propose a Modality-specific Representation Model (MRM) to model the distribution of target modalities. Then, we design a Modality-decoupled Diffusion Network (MDN) to efficiently and effectively learn the distribution from MRM. Finally, a Cross-conditioned UNet (C-UNet) with a Condition Embedding module is designed to synthesize the target modalities with the source modalities as input and the target distribution for guidance. Extensive experiments conducted on the BraTS2023 and UPenn-GBM benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract  = {The advent of Industry 4.0 has created a need for more flexible and adaptable manufacturing systems. This paper proposes the integration of AAS (Asset Administration Shells), SBM (Skill-based manufacturing) and OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture), to enable more flexible manufacturing systems. The integration of these concepts provides a solution for achieving faster and easier dynamic reconfiguration in manufacturing systems, which is essential for fulfilling the demand of customization and flexibility in modern production systems. An Asset Administration Shell provides a standardized structure for describing assets and their administration, while Skill-based manufacturing enables the deployment of task-oriented machines that can self-configure, self-diagnose, and self-optimize their performance. The use of OPC UA as a communication protocol ensures that these systems can communicate with one another in a secure and reliable way. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the integration of these three open technologies. This framework contributes to having a single interface and source of information for every asset, which can lead to increased efficiency by reducing changeover times, thus reducing the overall cost in flexible manufacturing system scenarios. Future work will focus on the implementation and validation of this framework in a real-world manufacturing setting.},

The impressive computing power and memory bandwidth of modern massively parallel computing devices encourage researchers to develop sparse linear algebra kernels that can exploit these platforms efficiently. In this sense, a main line of work improves the storage of matrices, aiming to optimize the communication between the memory and the cores. In previous work, the use of a strategy consisting of a delta-encoding with matrix reorderings compressed the indexing data of the matrix, saving storage and communications. This work presents an algorithm to improve the reordering strategy and the resulting compression of the indexing data. The results show that this strategy leads to important storage savings, which can also reduce data movements between the main memory and processors.},

  abstract  = {Several modern-day problems, like information overload and big data, need to deal with large amounts of data. As such, to meet the application requirements, for instance, performance and consistency, more and more systems are adapting to the specificities. The existing relational database management system (RDBMS)’s processing of massive data has become an issue because these databases do not deal with a massive amount of data. NoSQL is a database management system that makes processing massive and/or unstructured data easier because it uses key-value to store the data, collections or document stores instead of tables. Many companies today tend to start a project using NoSQL. However, HarperDB aims to produce a relational and non-relational DBMS, allowing developers to choose between different solutions. This paper aims to show the most relevant differences between HarperDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL and compare their performances. Preliminary results show that PostgreSQL performs better with structured data, but HarperDB can integrate NoSQL and SQL, which can be a significant advantage to HarperDB compared with the other solutions.},

  year      = {2024},
  month     = {jan},
  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {One approach to software testing is known as model-based testing, where test cases are generated from a model that represents the functional aspects of the system under test. If the system model is explicitly defined and accurately reflects the system’s behaviour, it can serve as a shared and reusable artefact. For example, the model can be utilized to generate a comprehensive test suite for the system under test (SUT), a methodology commonly referred to as model-based testing (MBT). Over time, the efficiency, capability, and maintainability of both computer code design and model-based systems have continually improved. However, there has been relatively little effort made to gather evidence to assess the precise relationship, boundaries, and practical challenges between the two. This review study aims to address the creation and prioritization of test cases, with a specific focus on reducing redundancy in test cases to enhance the system’s efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to addressing redundancy, this study proposes the use of finite state machines (FSM) as a modelling paradigm. Refactoring, which involves making changes to an application’s source code without altering its external functionality, is introduced to enhance code readability, complexity, extensibility, and maintainability. Code smells, which lead to the generation of redundant test cases, are mitigated through these refactoring techniques. Statistical analysis and methods are employed in this study to proactively reduce test cases by identifying instances of “lazy class code.” By assessing code cohesion and dependencies and implementing inline class refactoring techniques before test case generation, the study significantly reduces the number of redundant test cases produced. The primary objective of this work is to construct a test model from a UML activity diagram. From this test model, test paths for composite testing are derived. The study also provides various criteria for constructing test paths and outlines an automated method for this purpose.},

Research on Level Crossing (LC) safety has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this paper, we rely on formal methods, based on mathematical rigour, which provide real help for the designer to evaluate the behaviour of a system and avoid errors before its implementation. Thereby, we propose a railway LC system that suggests a new architecture which prevents very risky situations causing several accidents. To do so, we adopted the Event-B formal method to specify the safety requirements of our system and verify its correctness. Event-B is based on the refinement technique which allows a problem decomposition and then reduces modelling and verification effort.},

Digitalization patterns that conceptualize monitoring and controlling techniques are selected based on the application scenario and raise requirements for processing mechanisms as well as for the realization with physical devices. To reflect on the conceptualization and the digitalization patterns, project MEASURE is introduced. Concepts are applied to the emergency exercise context by addressing the application scenario modelling, the interaction between digital-physical world as well as the realization.

Despite these benefits, knowledge graphs require specific skills typically uncommon in building and energy system engineers. This work tackles this challenge by enabling system engineers to create and maintain knowledge graphs about BMS by dealing with visual diagrammatical models they are familiar with. For this, we built on the ontology-based meta-modelling approach and created a proof-of-concept AOAME4BMS, in which we implemented a BMS and used it for evaluation purposes.},

However, matching by backtracking —preferred by most real-world implementations for its practical performance and backward compatibility—can suffer from so-called catastrophic backtracking , which makes the number of backtracking super-linear and leads to the well-known ReDoS vulnerability. Inspired by a recent algorithm by Davis et al. that runs in linear time for (non-extended) regexes, we study efficient backtracking matching for regexes with two common extensions, namely look-around and atomic grouping . We present linear-time backtracking matching algorithms for these extended regexes. Their efficiency relies on memoization , much like the one by Davis et al.; we also strive for smaller memoization tables by carefully trimming their range. Our experiments—we used some real-world regexes with the aforementioned extensions—confirm the performance advantage of our algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Within the context of Industry 4.0 and the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) framework has emerged as a critical component for implementing Digital Twins that facilitate a seamless data exchange within a manufacturing ecosystem. The concept enables asset communication across various application domains, organizing the design and interaction amongst manufacturing components while capturing key information relating to assets such as operational parameters, intrinsic properties, and technical functionalities. Each category of information is stored within the AAS in a structure called a sub-model, while specific properties are stored as sub-model elements. Moreover, the literature presents a gap in post-processing the information contained within the sub-models to generate data-driven decisions and the bidirectional data exchange with the AAS. Additionally, the developing concept behind AAS requires demonstration with manufacturing cases of what can be done with the information in the submodels of the AAS. This research explores the practical implementation of AAS in a manufacturing context and the tools used in their development. An approach is developed to map a semantic ontology representation from the AAS structure. The semantic structure of the information enables querying and reasoning about the data, which contributes to better understanding among diverse manufacturing components, enabling enhanced monitoring and decision-making. The use case utilizes parameter data from the AAS to estimate a key performance Indicator, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and stores the value back in the AAS. Utilizing this approach contributes to optimizing manufacturing efficiency and productivity within manufacturing production.},

The spatial distribution of Ni in soil was discussed according to Kriging interpolation method, and the health risk assessment of heavy metals in soil was carried out based on HJ 25.3–2019. The results show that the heavy metal pollution in the site is mainly affected by the electroplating process, and the heavy metal Ni pollution decreased gradually with the increase of the distance from the pollution source and the vertical depth. According to the results of ecological risk assessment, the carcinogenic risk of heavy metal Ni in the soil within 3 m depth of the large electroplating workshop in the site is unacceptable, and the pollution degree beyond 3m depth is significantly reduced. The site needs to be controlled or adopt engineering measures such as soil remediation. Studies have shown that the existence of clay layer in the site can effectively reduce the downward migration of pollutants and protect the deep soil. Therefore, we should pay attention to the distribution of clay layer in the later project implementation process to ensure the safety of deep soil and groundwater.},

  abstract  = {High-performance computing and deep learning domains have been motivating the design of domain-specific processors. Although these processors can provide promising computation capability, they are notorious for exotic programming paradigms. To improve programming productivity and fully exploit the performance potential of these processors, domain-specific compilers (DSCs) have been proposed. However, building DSCs for emerging processors requires tremendous engineering efforts because the commonly used compilation stack is difficult to be reused. Owing to the advent of multilevel intermediate representation (MLIR), DSC developers can leverage reusable infrastructure to extend their customized functionalities without rebuilding the entire compilation stack. In this paper, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of MLIR by extending its reusable infrastructure to embrace a heterogeneous many-core processor (Sunway processor). In particular, we design a new Sunway dialect and corresponding backend for the Sunway processor, fully exploiting its architectural advantage and hiding its programming complexity. To show the ease of building a DSC, we leverage the Sunway dialect and existing MLIR dialects to build a stencil compiler for the Sunway processor. The experimental results show that our stencil compiler, built with a reusable approach, can even perform better than state-of-the-art stencil compilers.},

  abstract  = {Thunderstorms are a weather phenomenon characterized by lightning, thunder, and precipitation, and in Bangladesh, they are a common occurrence with the potential to cause significant damage to life and property. The objective of this study is to examine the sensitivity of the horizontal grid resolution of the WRF-ARW model for simulating thunderstorms in Bangladesh. Two cases from August 2022 were examined. The model was integrated over a 60-h period, with hourly outputs collected from August 16, 0000 UTC, to August 19, 1200 UTC, and two experiments were conducted using horizontal resolutions of 9 and 3 km. The results were validated using observational and ERA-5 reanalysis data. The findings showed that the 9-km resolution had better spatial agreement with ERA-5 for CAPE, although 3 km overestimated the maximum value compared to ERA-5. Thus, increasing the grid resolution will require more processing resources but will not always benefit the model’s efficiency for the given model setting. Higher grid resolution generally leads to better spatial accuracy because it captures more fine-scale features and processes in the atmosphere. Especially at coarse grid resolutions, fine-scale topography may be poorly represented or even completely smoothed out. However, the choice of physical parameterization schemes in the WRF model can affect its performance at different resolutions. Some parameterization schemes may perform better at coarser resolutions, while others may be more suitable for finer resolutions.},

In this study, we comprehensively unraveled the intra-patient response heterogeneity and intrinsic aggressive nature of PDAC on bulk and single-organoid resolution. We leveraged a fully characterized PDAC organoid panel ( N  = 8) and matched our artificial intelligence-driven, live-cell organoid image analysis with retrospective clinical patient response. In line with the clinical outcomes, we identified patient-specific sensitivities to the standard of care therapies (gemcitabine-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX) using a growth rate-based and normalized drug response metric. Moreover, the single-organoid analysis was able to detect resistant as well as invasive PDAC organoid clones, which was orchestrates on a patient, therapy, drug, concentration and time-specific level. Furthermore, our in vitro organoid analysis indicated a correlation with the matched patient progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the current, conventional drug response readouts. This work not only provides valuable insights on the response complexity in PDAC, but it also highlights the potential applications (extendable to other tumor types) and clinical translatability of our approach in drug discovery and the emerging era of personalized medicine.},

  abstract  = {Software reuse is a common practice that aims to reduce costs and effort, while improving quality and productivity. However, it also raises challenges of retrieving existing artifacts and adapting them to the given context. Sometimes, the most relevant artifacts are realized in a different application domain and/or in a different paradigm (e.g., object-oriented vs. data-driven). These challenges are extremely relevant to non-code artifacts, such as models, which are relatively rare, as well as vary in the level of details and quality. In this paper, we aim to explore the challenges and opportunities of cross application domain and cross modeling paradigm model reuse. These types of reuse require different mapping mechanisms (analogy creation and transformation, respectively), but similar adaptation operations (use-as-is, modification, omission and addition). To explore the challenges of these reuse types, we present the design and the results of a series of controlled experiments, involving 64 participants, which analyzed correctness of software model reuse across application domains and across two modeling paradigms: object-oriented expressed in UML use case and class diagrams and data-driven expressed in entity-relationship and data flow diagrams. Our results show that overall cross-domain reuse is more correctly performed than cross-paradigm reuse, especially with respect to addition. We further analyzed the challenges in each reuse type and found that modification and addition in both reuse types are quite challenging and require careful support to meet new or differing requirements.},

  abstract  = {Background In 2022, Omicron outbreaks occurred at multiple sites in China. It is of great importance to track the incidence trends and transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to guide further interventions. Methods Given the population size, economic level and transport level similarities, two groups of outbreaks (Shanghai vs. Chengdu and Sanya vs. Beihai) were selected for analysis. We developed the SEAIQRD, ARIMA, and LSTM models to seek optimal modeling techniques for waves associated with the Omicron variant regarding data predictive performance and mechanism transmission dynamics, respectively. In addition, we quantitatively modeled the impacts of different combinations of more stringent interventions on the course of the epidemic through scenario analyses. Results The best-performing LSTM model showed better prediction accuracy than the best-performing SEAIQRD and ARIMA models in most cases studied. The SEAIQRD model had an absolute advantage in exploring the transmission dynamics of the outbreaks. Regardless of the time to inflection point or the time to R _t curve below 1.0, Shanghai was later than Chengdu (day 46 vs. day 12/day 54 vs. day 14), and Sanya was later than Beihai (day 16 vs. day 12/day 20 vs. day 16). Regardless of the number of peak cases or the cumulative number of infections, Shanghai was higher than Chengdu (34,350 vs. 188/623,870 vs. 2,181), and Sanya was higher than Beihai (1,105 vs. 203/16,289 vs. 3,184). Scenario analyses suggested that upgrading control level in advance, while increasing the index decline rate and quarantine rate, were of great significance for shortening the time to peak and R _t below 1.0, as well as reducing the number of peak cases and final affected population. Conclusions The LSTM model has great potential for predicting the prevalence of Omicron outbreaks, whereas the SEAIQRD model is highly effective in revealing their internal transmission mechanisms. We recommended the use of joint interventions to contain the spread of the virus.},

  abstract  = {Recently, formal methods have been used in large industrial organisations (including AWS, Facebook/Meta, and Microsoft) and have proved to be an effective part of a software engineering process finding important bugs. Perhaps because of that, practitioners are interested in using them more often. Nevertheless, formal methods are far less applied than expected, particularly for safety-critical systems where they are strongly recommended and have the most significant potential. We hypothesise that formal methods still seem not applicable enough or ready for their intended use in such areas. In critical software engineering, what do we mean when we speak of a formal method? And what does it mean for such a method to be applicable both from a scientific and practical viewpoint? Based on what the literature tells about the first question, with this manifesto, we identify key challenges and lay out a set of guiding principles that, when followed by a formal method, give rise to its mature applicability in a given scope. Rather than exercising criticism of past developments, this manifesto strives to foster increased use of formal methods in any appropriate context to the maximum benefit.},

  abstract  = {A growing area of focus is using multi-fidelity(MF) simulations to predict the behavior of complex physical systems. In order to adequately utilize the popular sequential designs to improve the effectiveness of the MF method, two challenges involving good projection properties in the presence of effect sparsity and the sample allocation between the high-fidelity(HF) and low-fidelity (LF) codes remain to be addressed. Unfortunately, no systematic study has hitherto been done to deal with these two key issues simultaneously. This article develops a sequential nested design for MF experiments that pays attention to both the space-filling properties in all subsets of factors and the best combination between the two levels of accuracy. For the first issue, we propose a weighted maximum projection criterion combining the uniformity metrics of the HF and LF experiments to select HF points, where the weights are totally data-driven. Note that the obtained HF data is also executed in LF codes to form a nested structure. On the other hand, those samples that only appear in the LF simulation are obtained by the original maximum projection design. The second issue is directly connected with deciding which code to run in the next iteration. We use the entropy theory to score the execution of fidelity for each version, such that the one who has a greater potential to improve the model accuracy will be selected. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through several numerical examples. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the other three methods in terms of both the prediction accuracy of the final surrogate model and the uniformity in all subspaces of the two codes.},

Typically, the choice of initial values for the estimated system greatly affects the accuracy of state estimation; hence, the model transformation method is used to weaken IIV. The continuous-time FOS is discretized by using the Grünwald–Letnikov difference to obtain the difference equation. By utilizing the third-degree spherical-radial rule and the cubature points to represent nonlinear functions in the state equation and output equation, a fractional-order HECKF to deal with the correlated noise is proposed to achieve an effective state estimation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified with two simulation examples.},

We use a range of satellite and ground-based observations to evaluate the CPRCM simulations covering the period 1998–2007 comparing the CPRCM output with lower resolution regional and global climate model configurations for key regions of Brazil. We find that using the convection-permitting model at high resolution leads to large improvements in the representation of precipitation, specifically in simulating its diurnal cycle, frequency, and sub-daily intensity distribution (i.e. the proportion of heavy and light precipitation). We tentatively conclude that there are also improvements in the spatial structure of precipitation. We see higher precipitation intensity and extremes over Amazonia in the CPRCMs compared with observations, though more sub-daily observational data from meteorological stations are required to conclusively determine whether the CPRCMs add value in this regard. For annual mean precipitation and mean, maximum and minimum near surface temperatures, it is not clear that the CPRCMs add value compared with coarser-resolution models with parameterised convection. We also find large changes in the contribution to evapotranspiration from canopy evaporation compared to soil evaporation and transpiration compared with the RCM. This is likely to be related to the shift in precipitation intensity distribution of the CPRCMs compared to the RCM and its impact on the hydrological requires further investigation.},

  abstract  = {In this article, we study the role of teacher support in a collaborative learning setting that involves students’ constructions of visual representations in the environmental education context. Despite the consensus in the field of science education research that engagement with visual representations—such as diagrams, animations, and graphs—can support students’ conceptual understanding, studies reveal that learning from engagement with visual representations can be challenging for students. Adopting a sociocultural approach, this study contributes to extant research by analytically scrutinizing the role of teacher support in learning activities that revolve around students’ construction of visual representations. The empirical basis is a science project in which lower secondary school students drew and refined depictions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The analytical focus is on student–teacher interactions during group-based drawing activities in which students created representations of the carbon cycle and interacted with authorized representations. The analyses revealed how students found it challenging to compare, contrast, and integrate authorized representations and, additionally, to constructively use authorized representations in the process of designing their own representations. To support students in their efforts to construct scientific meaning, the teacher oriented the students’ attention towards the salient features of representations, supported students in making sense of ‘semiotic signs’, and enabled them to link scientific concepts with detailed depictions. In addition to the different forms of support provided by the teacher, the analyses of the student–teacher interactions also reveal the teacher’s use of specific ‘talk moves’ of elaboration and eliciting. The key implications include that teachers should select representations that are sufficiently different in terms of how concepts and phenomena are depicted, and that teachers should be prepared to support students in how to compare and contrast multiple representations. Further, strategies for supporting students’ exploration of their own ideas and suggestions are essential in the dynamics between students’ self-made representations and authorized representations. Denne artikkelen undersøker lærerens rolle i samarbeidsaktiviteter der elever lager visuelle representasjoner i naturfagundervisning om miljøspørsmål. Forskning på læring i naturfag om visuelle representasjoner som diagrammer, animasjoner og grafer har vist at slik ressurser utgjør viktig støtte for elevers utvikling av begrepsforståelse. Samtidig har en rekke studier vist at det er flere utfordringer knyttet til elevers læring med visuelle representasjoner. Med utgangspunkt i et sosiokulturelt og holistisk perspektiv, bidrar denne studien til eksisterende kunnskap ved å undersøke lærerens rolle i aktiviteter der elever skaper sine egne visuelle representasjoner. Det empiriske grunnlaget for studien er et naturfagprosjekt i en ungdomsskoleklasse der elevene arbeidet med å produsere og forbedre egne representasjoner om menneskeskapte klimaendringer. Det analytiske fokuset i studien er rettet mot elev-lærer-interaksjoner under gruppe-baserte tegneaktiviteter der elevene laget sine egne representasjoner av karbonkretsløpet. Analysene viser hvordan elevene strevde med å sammenligne, kontrastere og integrere autoriserte representasjoner, samt å kunne konstruktivt bruke autoriserte representasjoner i utformingen av egne representasjoner. For å støtte elevene i deres faglige meningsskaping, ledet læreren elevenes oppmerksomhet i retning av de fremtredende elementene i representasjonene, støttet elevene i å tolke ‘semiotiske tegn’ og i å skape sammenheng mellom faglige begreper og detaljer i representasjonene. Analysen av elev-lærer-interaksjonene viser også lærerens bruk av spesifikke strategier for utdyping og fremkalling av elevenes egne ideer i samtale med elevene. Sentrale implikasjoner inkluderer at lærere bør velge representasjoner som er tilstrekkelig forskjellige når det gjelder hvordan konsepter og fenomener beskrives, og at lærere bør være forberedt på å støtte elevene i hvordan de kan sammenligne og kontrastere flere representasjoner. Overordnet er konkrete grep for å støtte elevenes utforskning av egne ideer og forslag avgjørende i dynamikken mellom elevenes selvlagde representasjoner og autoriserte representasjoner.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, measurement, and decoherence. The basic units of computation are qubits, which are abstract objects with a mathematical expression to implement the quantum mechanics principles. Alongside quantum hardware, software is a principal element for conducting quantum computing. The software consists of logic gates and quantum circuits that implement algorithms for the execution of quantum programs. Due to those characteristics, quantum computing is a paradigm that non-physics experts cannot understand. Under this new scheme for developing software, it is important to integrate a conceptual framework of the fundamentals on which quantum computing is based. In this paper, we present a kind of taxonomical view of the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and the derived concepts that integrate the emerging discipline of quantum software engineering. We performed a quasi-systematic mapping for conducting the systematic review because the objective of the review only intends to detect the fundamental concepts of quantum computing and quantum software. The results can help computer science students and professors as a starting point to address the study of this discipline.},

The method uses a machine-readable representation of the legal knowledge to support document assembly and to help the students to understand how the assembly is performed.

We propose a system called LEDAS (LEgal Document Assembly System) for the interactive assembly of legal documents. It guides users through the assembly process and provides explanations of the interconnection between input data and claims stated in the document. The system acts as a platform for practicing drafting skills and has great potential as an education tool. It allows teachers to configure the system for the assembly of some particular type of legal document and then enables students to draft the documents by investigating which information is relevant for these documents and how the input data shape the final document. The generated legal document is complemented by a graphical representation of legal arguments expressed in the document. The system is based on existing legal standards to facilitate its introduction in the legal domain. Applicability of the system in the education of future lawyers is positively evaluated by the group of law students and their TA.},

Based on physiologically plausible scenarios, we also aim to determine the most probable realistic values of these parameters that facilitate the formation of spiral waves. Furthermore, we study the destabilizing impact of external direct and Faradaic currents on spiral wave patterns, showing that they commonly convert into other turbulent patterns or vanish altogether.

The target patterns are selected as they are hypothesized to be more physically realistic, accurate, or reliable, compared to those in the second data set (e.g., using observed or reanalysis data for the target data set and climate model data for the second data set). Using the rotated principal component analysis, we classify the austral summer precipitation in Africa south of the equator into four regions of the domain: the south, east-central, northeast, and northwest. The physical basis for each region is established by examining regional variations in vertical velocity coupled with variations in the patterns of advective moisture fluxes, converging at specific portions in the study region. On this basis, the observed precipitation regions are deemed physically interpretable and serve as the reference patterns to probe the degree of reference pattern consistency with (i) the precipitation patterns from ERA5 and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, (ii) the precipitation patterns from 2 high-resolution regional climate models driven by ERA-Interim, and by HadGEM2 and (iii) the impact of future climate change on the simulated patterns from the regional climate models. Comparing principal components from different datasets is not straightforward as there are two sources of variability: (i) that arising from non-optimal alignment (misalignment) of the two linear subspaces or manifolds (a manifold is regarded as a vector space) and (ii) that arising from true differences in the modes from the different datasets. The importance of applying Procrustes target analysis is that climate patterns derived from principal component analysis are known to be sensitive to sampling variability. Procrustes target analysis allows for maximal vector alignment, making it possible to disentangle the two sources of variability so that the analyst can assign the dissimilarities to differences in the modes. We document that, after the application of Procrustes target analysis matching, the variability arising from misalignment between the reference set and second set of principal components was reduced, as measured by the improved matching between the vectors from approximately 3.7–41.7},

  abstract  = {Abstract The development and adoption of microservices, as one of the most promising directions for developing heterogeneous distributed software systems, have been driven by dynamic changes in business and technology. In addition to the development of new applications, a significant aspect of microservices is the migration from legacy monolithic systems to microservice architectures. Such development trends are accompanied by an increase in the number of primary and secondary publications addressing microservices, highlighting the need to systematize research at a higher level. The objective of this study is to comprehensively analyze secondary studies in the field of microservices from the following five aspects: (1) publishing trends, (2) quality trends of secondary studies, (3) research trends, (4) domains of implementation, and (5) future research directions. The study follows the guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review. The findings were derived from 44 secondary studies published in the period from January 2016 to January 2023. These studies were organized and analyzed to address the five proposed research questions pertaining to the study objectives. The findings suggest that the most promising research directions are related to the development, implementation, and validation of new approaches, methods, and tools that encompass all the phases of the life cycle. Additionally, these research directions have applications in a variety of business and human life domains. Recommendations for further literature reviews relate to improvement of quality assessment of selected studies, more detailed review of architecture quality attributes, inquiry of human factor issues, and certain maintenance and operation issues. From the methodological aspect, recommendations relate to using social science qualitative methods for more detailed analysis of selected studies, and inclusion of gray literature that will bring the real experience of experts from industry.},

  abstract  = {Effective multi-agent teamwork can be facilitated by using personas to decompose goals into lower-level team subtasks through a shared understanding of multi-agent tasks. However, traditional methods for role discovery and assignment are not scalable and fail to adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. To solve this problem, we propose a new framework for learning dynamic role discovery and assignment. We first introduce an action encoder to construct a vector representation for each action based on its characteristics, and define and classify roles from a more comprehensive perspective based on both action differences and action contributions. To rationally assign roles to agents, we propose a representation-based role selection policy based on consideration of role differences and reward horizons, which enables agents to play roles dynamically by dynamically assigning agents with similar abilities to play the same role. Agents playing the same role share their learning of the role, and different roles correspond to different action spaces. We also introduce regularizers to increase the differences between roles and stabilize training by preventing agents from changing roles frequently. Role selection and role policy integrate action representations and role differences in a restricted action space, improving learning efficiency. We conducted experiments in the SMAC benchmark and showed that our method enables effective role discovery and assignment, outperforming the baseline on four of the six scenarios, with an average improvement in win rate of 20

To significantly impact triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability, these fashion CBMs need to be scalable. This paper investigates the challenges for scaling resale-based fashion from a TBL perspective, as well as the strategic resources required to solve these. Based on 15 semi-structured interviews, six key scalability challenges and six main strategic resources are identified. Findings show that even though challenges are mostly referred to in economic terms, environmental and social challenges are also present. The difference is that those challenges are less visible, partly due to the lack of clear and standardised tools and definitions to interpret scale. Lessons from the study can be insightful for practitioners in reflecting on the scalability potential of their CBMs from a TBL perspective and understanding what resources to make use of or develop.},

This study uses provincial panel data from China during 2011–2019 to construct a moderating mediating effect model and a spatial panel Durbin model to examine the relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions reduction. This study analyzes the mediating effect of the energy structure on the digital economy’s impact on carbon emission reduction, and the spatial effect and regional heterogeneity of the digital economy’s impact on carbon emission reduction. The findings indicate that the development of the digital economy can effectively promote regional carbon emission reductions, both directly and indirectly, with a significant spatial spillover effect. Second, the energy structure plays a significant mediating role in promoting carbon emission reduction in the digital economy, and the industrial structure has a positive moderating effect. Third, the impact of the digital economy on carbon emissions reduction has significant regional heterogeneity, and the inhibitory effect of the digital economy is more effective in the central and western provinces. This study provides a theoretical reference for achieving high-quality development of the digital economy while promoting carbon emissions reduction.},

  abstract  = {Both Cu60Ni38Co2 and Cu60Ni40 alloy were naturally cooled after rapid solidification from the liquid phase. The transformation law of the microstructure characteristics of the rapidly solidified alloy with the change of undercooling (Δ T ) was systematically studied. It is found that the two alloys experience the same transformation process. The refinement structures under different undercoolings were characterized by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the characteristics of the refinement structure of the two alloys with low undercooling are the same, but the characteristics of the refinement structure with high undercooling are opposite. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results of Cu60Ni38Co2 alloy show that the dislocation network density of low undercooled microstructure is lower than that of high undercooled microstructure. By combining EBSD and TEM, it could be confirmed that the dendrite remelting fracture is the reason for the refinement of the low undercooled structure, while the high undercooled structure is refined due to recrystallization. On this basis, in the processing of copper base alloys, there will be serious work hardening phenomenon and machining hard problem of consciousness problems caused by excessive cutting force. A two-dimensional orthogonal turning finite element model was established using ABAQUS software to analyze the changes in cutting speed and tool trajectory in copper based alloy ultrasonic elliptical vibration turning. The results show that in copper based alloy ultrasonic elliptical vibration turning, cutting process parameters have a significant impact on cutting force. Choosing reasonable process parameters can effectively reduce cutting force and improve machining quality.},

  abstract  = {Recently, many methods have utilized Haar wavelet to extract frequency-domain information for image deraining. However, Haar wavelet and other tensor product wavelets only capture high frequencies in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, leading to the loss of high-frequency details in deraining methods. To address this issue, we propose a multi-aggregation network (MAGNet) based on non-separable lifting wavelet transform (NLWT), where NLWT is employed to capture high-frequency rain streaks in various directions. MAGNet aggregates neighboring features and incorporates outer skip connections based on the U-Net architecture, effectively utilizing the complementary information of rain patterns in different features. Additionally, a gated fusion module is used to fuse the aggregated features, capturing important rain pattern information and reducing feature redundancy. Moreover, MAGNet employs a scale-guide progressive fusion module to exploit the similarity between rain patterns at adjacent scales for deraining. Experiments on rainy datasets and a joint rain removal and object detection task demonstrate that our MAGNet outperforms advanced methods.

  abstract  = {Stratospheric water vapour concentrations show robust multidecadal variability which is stronger in the northern than the southern hemisphere at mid-stratosphere levels, according to satellite observations and atmospheric model simulations. Stratospheric water vapor increases are expected in response to greenhouse gas-forced climate warming, and these changes act as a positive feedback to surface climate. Previous efforts at inferring trends from the 3–4 decade-long observational stratospheric water vapor record have yielded conflicting results. Here we show that a robust multi-decadal variation of water vapor concentrations exists in most parts of the stratosphere based on satellite observations and atmospheric model simulations, which clearly divides the past 40 years into two wet decades (1986–1997; 2010–2020) and one dry decade (1998–2009). This multi-decadal variation, especially pronounced in the lower to middle stratosphere and in the northern hemisphere, is associated with decadal temperature anomalies (±0.2 K) at the cold point tropopause and a hemispheric asymmetry in changes of the Brewer-Dobson circulation modulating methane oxidation. Multi-decadal variability must be taken into account when evaluating stratospheric water vapor trends over recent decades.},

  abstract  = {When using mathematical models to make quantitative predictions for clinical or industrial use, it is important that predictions come with a reliable estimate of their accuracy (uncertainty quantification). Because models of complex biological systems are always large simplifications, model discrepancy arises—models fail to perfectly recapitulate the true data generating process. This presents a particular challenge for making accurate predictions, and especially for accurately quantifying uncertainty in these predictions. Experimentalists and modellers must choose which experimental procedures ( protocols ) are used to produce data used to train models. We propose to characterise uncertainty owing to model discrepancy with an ensemble of parameter sets, each of which results from training to data from a different protocol. The variability in predictions from this ensemble provides an empirical estimate of predictive uncertainty owing to model discrepancy, even for unseen protocols. We use the example of electrophysiology experiments that investigate the properties of hERG potassium channels. Here, ‘information-rich’ protocols allow mathematical models to be trained using numerous short experiments performed on the same cell. In this case, we simulate data with one model and fit it with a different (discrepant) one. For any individual experimental protocol, parameter estimates vary little under repeated samples from the assumed additive independent Gaussian noise model. Yet parameter sets arising from the same model applied to different experiments conflict—highlighting model discrepancy. Our methods will help select more suitable ion channel models for future studies, and will be widely applicable to a range of biological modelling problems.},

  abstract  = {Habitat selection studies facilitate assessing and predicting species distributions and habitat connectivity, but habitat selection can vary temporally and among individuals, which is often ignored. We used GPS telemetry data from 96 Gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) in the western Great Lakes region of the USA to assess differences in habitat selection while wolves exhibited resident (territorial) or non-resident (dispersing or floating) movements and discuss implications for habitat connectivity. We used a step-selection function (SSF) to assess habitat selection by wolves exhibiting resident or non-resident movements, and modeled circuit connectivity throughout the western Great Lakes region. Wolves selected for natural land cover and against areas with high road densities, with no differences in selection among wolves when resident, dispersing, or floating. Similar habitat selection between resident and non-resident wolves may be due to similarity in environmental conditions, when non-resident movements occur largely within established wolf range rather than near the periphery or beyond the species range. Alternatively, non-resident wolves may travel through occupied territories because higher food availability or lower human disturbance outweighs risks posed by conspecifics. Finally, an absence of differences in habitat selection between resident and non-resident wolf movements may be due to other unknown reasons. We recommend considering context-dependency when evaluating differences in movements and habitat use between resident and non-resident individuals. Our results also provide independent validation of a previous species distribution model and connectivity analysis suggesting most potential wolf habitat in the western Great Lakes region is occupied, with limited connectivity to unoccupied habitat.},

  abstract  = {As software systems become increasingly large and complex, automated parameter tuning of software systems (PTSS) has been the focus of research and many tuning algorithms have been proposed recently. However, due to the lack of a unified platform for comparing and reproducing existing tuning algorithms, it remains a significant challenge for a user to choose an appropriate algorithm for a given software system. There are multiple reasons for this challenge, including diverse experimental conditions, lack of evaluations for different tasks, and excessive evaluation costs of tuning algorithms. In this paper, we propose an extensible and efficient benchmark, referred to as PTSSBench, which provides a unified platform for supporting a comparative study of different tuning algorithms via surrogate models and actual systems. We demonstrate the usability and efficiency of PTSSBench through comparative experiments of six state-of-the-art tuning algorithms from a holistic perspective and a task-oriented perspective. The experimental results show the necessity and effectiveness of parameter tuning for software systems and indicate that the PTSS problem remains an open problem. Moreover, PTSSBench allows extensive runs and in-depth analyses of parameter tuning algorithms, hence providing an efficient and effective way for researchers to develop new tuning algorithms and for users to choose appropriate tuning algorithms for their systems. The proposed PTSSBench benchmark together with the experimental results is made publicly available online as an open-source project.},

  abstract  = {TP53 and RB1 loss-of-function mutations are common in osteosarcoma. During development, combined loss of TP53 and RB1 function leads to downregulation of autophagy and the aberrant formation of primary cilia, cellular organelles essential for the transmission of canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Excess cilia formation then leads to hypersensitivity to Hedgehog (Hh) ligand signaling. In mouse and human models, we now show that osteosarcomas with mutations in TP53 and RB1 exhibit enhanced ligand-dependent Hh pathway activation through Smoothened (SMO), a transmembrane signaling molecule required for activation of the canonical Hh pathway. This dependence is mediated by hypersensitivity to Hh ligand and is accompanied by impaired autophagy and increased primary cilia formation and expression of Hh ligand in vivo. Using a conditional genetic mouse model of Trp53 and Rb1 inactivation in osteoblast progenitors, we further show that deletion of Smo converts the highly malignant osteosarcoma phenotype to benign, well differentiated bone tumors. Conversely, conditional overexpression of SHH ligand, or a gain-of-function SMO mutant in committed osteoblast progenitors during development blocks terminal bone differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate that the SMO antagonist sonidegib (LDE225) induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation in vivo in osteosarcomas that express primary cilia and Hh ligand combined with mutations in TP53. These results provide a mechanistic framework for aberrant Hh signaling in osteosarcoma based on defining mutations in the tumor suppressor, TP53.},

Here, the authors demonstrate that P3F expression induces endothelial cells reprogramming into functional myogenic stem cells, driving the formation of FP-RMS in mouse models. Fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS) driven by the expression of the PAX3-FOXO1 (P3F) fusion oncoprotein is an aggressive subtype of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma. FP-RMS histologically resembles developing muscle yet occurs throughout the body in areas devoid of skeletal muscle highlighting that FP-RMS is not derived from an exclusively myogenic cell of origin. Here we demonstrate that P3F reprograms mouse and human endothelial progenitors to FP-RMS. We show that P3F expression in aP2-Cre expressing cells reprograms endothelial progenitors to functional myogenic stem cells capable of regenerating injured muscle fibers. Further, we describe a FP-RMS mouse model driven by P3F expression and Cdkn2a loss in endothelial cells. Additionally, we show that P3F expression in TP53 -null human iPSCs blocks endothelial-directed differentiation and guides cells to become myogenic cells that form FP-RMS tumors in immunocompromised mice. Together these findings demonstrate that FP-RMS can originate from aberrant development of non-myogenic cells driven by P3F.},

  abstract  = {One hundred and seventy two introgressed hybrids from four different introgression groups and in three nobilized stages (F_1, BC_1,and BC_2) involving two genera viz., Sugarcane ( Saccharum s pp ) and Erianthusl (E.arundinaceus) ,and Coimbatore (Commercials) clones were studied for yield and quality traits, and as well with 30 SSR markers (simple sequence repeats) for diversity and population structure. The yield and quality components of the introgressed hybrids from improved S. spontaneum , improved S. robustum , S. barberi (Pathri) and E. arundinaceus (IK-76-76) showed significant variation. The traits viz., cane height, single cane weight and cane yield showed the highest level of phenotypic and genotypic variation. 456 polymorphic alleles in all with values ranging from 6 (SMC 863-GC) to 24 (NKS 43) with an average of 15 alleles per primer were studied. Polymorphism information content (PIC) generated by 30 SSR primers varied from 0.57 (NKS 1) to 0.94 (NKS 34) and the highest average PIC (0.93) was observed in hybrids of S. spontaneum (SSH). The highest number of observed and effective alleles, and Shannon’s index were also registered by introgressed hybrids of SSH and the lowest variability was observed with hybrids of Co canes x S. barberi . SSR-based population genetic measures identified three mating groups involving improved S.officinarum , improved S.robustum and Coimbatore canes with maximum variability. Structure analysis identified 51 introgressed hybrids with abundant genetic variation and low gene flow as a new germplasm source for future sugarcane breeding programmes. Fifty-nine rare alleles were detected, and structure analysis revealed a low degree of admixture between the generated hybrids. Low gene flow estimates from group I ( Nm : 1.052, where mostly F_1 and BC_1 hybrids were grouped together) explained that the maximum variability from parental clones was inherited until the BC_1 generation, and high values of Nm in group III also indicated that most of the wild alleles were fixed in the BC_1 population. Structure and cluster analysis (PCoA, UPGMA) explained that the grouping of introgressed hybrids is highly correlated to different stages of nobilization. UPGMA and PCoA methods grouped the individuals into three major clusters, with a clear differentiation of F_1 and backcross hybrids grouped under different internal sub-clusters. The occurrence of wide genetic variability in the population and elite hybrids with a unique genetic base can be exploited in breeding programmes to develop trait specific donors for genetic enhancement and to mitigate climate change .},

This study presents a nuanced analysis of welfare regimes in 20 Asian countries, examining their transformation since the 2000s through principle component analysis and clustering algorithms. Contrary to the predictions of comparative political economy and international political economy theories, the findings reveal that these nations neither exhibit a strict divergence in welfare patterns nor converge strictly towards market-driven commodification. Instead, they adopt a balanced approach, harmonizing elements of both commodification and decommodification. This flexibility allows them to navigate complex challenges, including productivity competition, external shocks, and internal inequality. The study suggests that this balanced approach may act as a positive feedback mechanism, enabling these countries to adapt to both global economic pressures and domestic social imperatives.},

  abstract  = {Introduction Dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimen was included in the expanded formulary of China's National Free Antiretroviral Treatment Program at the end of 2021. Yet high price of DTG and lack of health economic evaluation in China present barriers for implementation of the regimen. The study aims to investigate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of DTG-based regimen for treatment-naive HIV infection in China. Methods A decision-analytic Markov model was used to obtain the costs and effectiveness of four regimens: Arm A, efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen; Arm B, DTG-based regimen; Arm C, elvitegravir/cobicistat/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (EVG/c/FTC/TAF) regimen; Arm D, abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (ABC/3TC/DTG) regimen. The potential impact of national centralized drug procurement policy was assessed in scenario analysis. The results were further validated through sensitivity analysis. Results Compared with other three regimens, DTG-based regimen led to the fewest cumulative adverse reactions, opportunistic infections and deaths. Compared with EFV-based regimen, the base-case ICERs for DTG-based regimen were 13,357 (USD/QALY) and 13,424 (USD/QALY) from the healthcare system and societal perspective respectively. In the policy scenario analysis with the procurement price of DTG equal to that of LPV/r, DTG-based regimen would be dominant. The model results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions DTG-based regimen for treatment-naive patients is likely to be cost-effective and deserve wider implementation in China. This study strongly suggests the centralized procurement of DTG to minimize cost and maximize cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Background Despite the potential benefits of software modelling, developers have shown a considerable reluctance towards its application. There is substantial existing research studying industrial use and technical challenges of modelling. However, there is a lack of detailed empirical work investigating how students perceive modelling. Aim We investigate the perceptions of students towards modelling in a university environment. Method We conducted a multiple case study with 5 cases (5 courses from 3 universities) and two units of analysis (student and instructor). We collected data through 21 semi-structured interviews, which we analysed using in-vivo coding and thematic analysis. Results Students see some benefits of modelling, e.g., using models for planning and communicating within the group. However, several factors negatively influence their understanding of modelling, e.g., assignments with unclear expectations, irregular and insufficient feedback on their models, and lack of experience with the problem domains. Conclusions Our findings help in understanding better why students struggle with software modelling, and might be reluctant to adopt it later on. Our recommendations on modelling education could help to improve education and training in software modelling, both at university and in industry. Specifically, we recommend that educators try to provide feedback beyond syntactical issues, and to consider using problem domains that students are knowledgeable about.},

  abstract  = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are revolutionizing online education and have become a popular teaching platform. However, traditional MOOCs often overlook learners' individual needs and preferences when designing learning materials and activities, resulting in suboptimal learning experiences. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach to identify learners' preferences for different learning styles by analyzing their traces in MOOC environments. The Felder–Silverman Learning Style Model is adopted as it is one of the most widely used models in technology-enhanced learning. This research focuses on developing a reliable predictive model that can accurately identify learning styles. Based on insights gained from our model implementation, we propose MOOCLS (MOOC Learning Styles), an intuitive visualization tool. MOOCLS can help teachers and instructional designers to gain significant insight into the diversity of learning styles within their MOOCs. This will allow them to design activities and content that better support the learning styles of their learners, which can lead to higher learning engagement, improved performance, and reduction in time to learn.},

We drive Bloch points using spin-transfer torques and find that Bloch points can move collectively without any Hall effect and report that Bloch points are repelled from the sample boundaries and each other. We study pinning of Bloch points at wedge-shaped constrictions (notches) in the nanostrip and demonstrate that arrays of Bloch points can be moved past a series of notches in a controlled manner by applying consecutive current pulses of different strength. Finally, we simulate a T-shaped geometry and demonstrate that a Bloch point can be moved along different paths by applying current between suitable strip ends.},

In this paper, we propose and publicly release AUTOMATE, a pipeline for automatic task knowledge extraction from expert-written domain texts. AUTOMATE integrates semantic sentence classification, semantic role labeling, and identification of procedural connectors, in order to extract templates of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) relations that can be directly implemented in any sufficiently expressive logic programming formalism for autonomous reasoning, assuming some low-level commonsense and domain-independent knowledge is available. This is the first work that bridges natural language descriptions of complex LTL relations and the automation of full robotic tasks. Unlike most recent similar works that assume strict language constraints in substantially simplified domains, we test our pipeline on texts that reflect the expressiveness of natural language used in available textbooks and manuals. In fact, we test AUTOMATE in the surgical robotic scenario, defining realistic language constraints based on a publicly available dataset. In the context of two benchmark training tasks with texts constrained as above, we show that automatically extracted LTL templates, after translation to a suitable logic programming paradigm, achieve comparable planning success in reduced time, with respect to logic programs written by expert programmers.},

Most traditional CE algorithms are explored under the assumption of Gaussian white noise, which limits the algorithms performance in real wireless communication situations. In this work, a novel self-adaptive CE algorithm based on the maximum entropy principle (MEP) was studied, which analyzes the statistical components of an arbitrary noise environment. In addition, an MEP channel-based signal estimation algorithm was studied. Furthermore, the statistical characteristics of channels were considered the regularization terms in the objective function for providing prior information and further increasing the accuracy. It was found that the proposed algorithm not only provides accurate CE but also reduces pilot consumption by using estimated signal data as pseudo pilots. The superior features of the proposed method concerning CE accuracy, pilot consumption, and robustness were confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations.},

Since the 1960s, brushing has been described in mathematical models, but mainly through empirical in vivo and in vitro studies. The development of new materials and devices dedicated to the removal of oral biofilm, with a view to environmental sustainability, has necessitated the development of modern brushing simulation models. With the aim of making the estimation of the cleaning performance of a toothbrush quantitative, and in order to set up a numerical tool for supporting the design and optimization of the brushing operations, the present study describes the development of a novel computational model. It is able to estimate the forces exchanged between the bristles of the toothbrush and the tooth surface through numerical simulations. The innovative modeling approach, based on discrete flexible multibody techniques, allowed a three-dimensional description of the behavior of the bristles, obtaining accurate results with reasonable computational time. The verification of the model is performed through a dedicated test bench performing controlled movements. The comparison between the numerical model and experimental results demonstrates the reliability of the approach. The proposed approach is also tested on a complex three-dimensional case of brushing in order to verify the behavior in complex scenarios. The proposed novel simulation model has proven to be able to simulate the brushing action of a toothbrush composed of thousands of bristles on a detailed and three-dimensional dental surface.},

  abstract  = {The common purpose of models is to provide simplified representations of other phenomena. Depending on type, they are suitable for communication, documentation, prognostication, problem solving, and more. Various types of models, such as drawings, mock-ups, flow charts, and mathematical formulae, are important tools in engineering work. An introduction to the area of technological modelling is therefore an essential component in secondary technology and engineering education, both to prepare for future studies and work, and to instil a general technological literacy. Models in the form of technical drawings and physical models are mentioned in several international curricula and standards for secondary education, but the nature of models or the modelling process are seldom elaborated upon. The purpose of this article is to investigate the ‘why?’, the ‘what?’, and the ‘how?’ of teaching and learning about models and modelling in secondary technology and engineering education. We discuss the roles of models and modelling and suggest a modelling framework for technology and engineering education consisting of a six-step modelling process that can be used in education with increasing level of complexity: identification , isolation , simplification , validation, verification , and presentation . Examples from Swedish curricula and secondary school textbooks are used to highlight the progress (or lack thereof) concerning model creation and model use. It was found that especially validation and verification are downplayed or missing in these accounts. Special attention needs to be given to the simplification step, where the balance between simplicity and realism often leads to difficult decisions in the modelling process.},

  abstract  = {Reducing global forest losses is essential to mitigate climate change and its associated social costs. Multiple market and non-market factors can enhance or reduce forest loss. Here, to understand the role of non-market factors (for example, policies, climate anomalies or conflicts), we can compare observed trends to a reference (expected) scenario that excludes non-market factors. We define an expected scenario by simulating land-use decisions solely driven by market prices, productivities and presumably plausible decision-making. The land-use allocation model considers economic profits and uncertainties as incentives for forest conversion. We compare reference forest losses in Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia (2000–2019) with observed forest losses and assign differences from non-market factors. Our results suggest that non-market factors temporarily lead to lower-than-expected forest losses summing to 11.1 million hectares, but also to phases with higher-than-expected forest losses of 11.3 million hectares. Phases with lower-than-expected forest losses occurred earlier than those with higher-than-expected forest losses. The damages avoided by delaying emissions that would otherwise have occurred represent a social value of US$61.6 billion (as of the year 2000). This result shows the economic importance of forest conservation efforts in the tropics, even if reduced forest loss might be temporary and reverse over time. Understanding the drivers of forest losses and their economic implications is key to designing efficient climate policies. This study simulates market-driven land-use decisions to identify the factors contributing to forest losses, revealing such losses, their trends, temporal variation and social value.},

  abstract  = {Individual fish movement patterns and behaviors influence population-level traits, and are important for understanding their ecology and evolution. Understanding these behaviors is key for managing and conserving migratory animal populations, including Atlantic tarpon ( Megalops atlanticus ), that support an economically important recreational fishery. Using acoustic telemetry, we tracked individual movement patterns of M. atlanticus inhabiting the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the southeast coast of the US over successive years. Net-squared displacement models revealed considerable individual-level variation in movement patterns with high individual-level repeatability in the timing of migrations and migratory pathways. Although distinct migratory subgroups existed, M. atlanticus generally migrate northward in the spring and summer to putative foraging grounds and remain in these areas for, on average, four months and then migrate southward in the fall. Subadult M. atlanticus exhibited similar migratory patterns as adults, while large juveniles exhibited either resident or nomadic behaviors. For migratory individuals, fish size did not influence movement patterns. Given that distinct migratory subgroups seasonally mixed in southern Florida for spawning activity, our study indicates that M. atlanticus along the eastern Gulf of Mexico and southeastern coast of the US should be considered a single interconnected stock. With that in mind, using M. atlanticus angler and guide knowledge, we assessed the vulnerability of M. atlanticus to potential threats across their range and along migratory pathways. Collectively, the far-ranging nature of M. atlanticus and their diversity in movement patterns highlights the need for more uniform and cohesive management and conservation efforts.},

  abstract  = {Wetlands can affect regional climate by altering surface-atmosphere interactions. This paper investigates drivers and patterns of evapotranspiration in South American wetlands, from the Amazon floodplains to the large Pantanal system. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key process linking surface and atmospheric energy budgets, yet its drivers and patterns across wetlandscapes are poorly understood worldwide. Here we assess the ET dynamics in 12 wetland complexes across South America, revealing major differences under temperate, tropical, and equatorial climates. While net radiation is a dominant driver of ET seasonality in most environments, flooding also contributes strongly to ET in tropical and equatorial wetlands, especially in meeting the evaporative demand. Moreover, significant water losses through wetlands and ET differences between wetlands and uplands occur in temperate, more water-limited environments and in highly flooded areas such as the Pantanal, where slow river flood propagation drives the ET dynamics. Finally, floodplain forests produce the greatest ET in all environments except the Amazon River floodplains, where upland forests sustain high rates year round. Our findings highlight the unique hydrological functioning and ecosystem services provided by wetlands on a continental scale.},

Information derived from the point cloud can be used for quality check of a building (e.g. wall flatness or mutual perpendicularity of walls) or creation of virtual models of buildings. Therefore, segmentation of the planar point cloud into subsets representing the surface of the wall and other structures (e.g. door, electrical outlets) is desired. We describe a mathematical model of evolving planar curves, which is used for the segmentation of the point cloud. The evolution of curves is controlled by the properties of the scanned walls, such as colour and intensity. We discretize the model using the finite-volume method and the semi-implicit Inflow-Implicit/Outflow-Explicit (IIOE) scheme. We demonstrate the functionality of segmentation on real data.},

  abstract  = {Drug combinations are key to circumvent resistance mechanisms compromising response to single anti-cancer targeted therapies. The implementation of combinatorial approaches involving MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors in the context of KRAS-mutated lung cancers focuses fundamentally on targeting KRAS proximal activators or effectors. However, the antitumor effect is highly determined by compensatory mechanisms arising in defined cell types or tumor subgroups. A potential strategy to find drug combinations targeting a larger fraction of KRAS-mutated lung cancers may capitalize on the common, distal gene expression output elicited by oncogenic KRAS. By integrating a signature-driven drug repurposing approach with a pairwise pharmacological screen, here we show synergistic drug combinations consisting of multi-tyrosine kinase PKC inhibitors together with MEK1/2 or KRASG12C inhibitors. Such combinations elicit a cytotoxic response in both in vitro and in vivo models, which in part involves inhibition of the PKC inhibitor target AURKB. Proteome profiling links dysregulation of MYC expression to the effect of both PKC inhibitor-based drug combinations. Furthermore, MYC overexpression appears as a resistance mechanism to MEK1/2 and KRASG12C inhibitors. Our study provides a rational framework for selecting drugs entering combinatorial strategies and unveils MEK1/2- and KRASG12C-based therapies for lung cancer. The success of targeting KRAS for cancer therapy is limited by resistance due to compensatory mechanism, making combinatorial approaches attractive. Here, the authors use a KRAS signature drug repurposing screen and identify the multityrosine kinase PKC inhibitor Midostaurin as synergistic with MEK and KRAS inhibitors in KRAS-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.},

  abstract  = {The future risk of tropical cyclones (TCs) strongly depends on changes in TC frequency, but models have persistently produced contrasting projections. A satisfactory explanation of the projected changes also remains elusive. Here we show a warming-induced contraction of tropical convection delays and reduces TC formation. This contraction manifests as stronger equatorial convection and weaker off-equatorial convection. It has been robustly projected by climate models, particularly in the northern hemisphere. This contraction shortens TC seasons by delaying the poleward migration of the intertropical convergence zone. At seasonal peaks of TC activity, the equatorial and off-equatorial components of this contraction are associated with TC-hindering environmental changes. Finally, the convection contraction and associated warming patterns can partly explain the ensemble spread in projecting future TC frequency. This study highlights the role of convection contraction and provides motivation for coordinated research to solidify our confidence in future TC risk projections. This study, based on a large set of climate simulations, suggests a delay and reduction of hurricane formation in a warmer climate, linked to the warming-induced contraction of tropical ascents that makes rainstorms more concentrated near the equator.},

Here we generate a cross-species proteomic map of synapse development in the human, macaque and mouse neocortex. By tracking the changes of more than 1,000 postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins from midgestation to young adulthood, we find that PSD maturation in humans separates into three major phases that are dominated by distinct pathways. Cross-species comparisons reveal that human PSDs mature about two to three times slower than those of other species and contain higher levels of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) in the perinatal period. Enhancement of RhoGEF signalling in human neurons delays morphological maturation of dendritic spines and functional maturation of synapses, potentially contributing to the neotenic traits of human brain development. In addition, PSD proteins can be divided into four modules that exert stage- and cell-type-specific functions, possibly explaining their differential associations with cognitive functions and diseases. Our proteomic map of synapse development provides a blueprint for studying the molecular basis and evolutionary changes of synapse maturation.},

  abstract  = {Model-driven engineering (MDE) is an effective means of synchronizing among stakeholders, thereby being a crucial part of the software development life cycle. In recent years, MDE has been on the rise, triggering the need for automatic modeling assistants to support metamodelers during their daily activities. Among others, it is crucial to enable model designers to choose suitable components while working on new (meta)models. In our previous work, we proposed MORGAN, a graph kernel-based recommender system to assist developers in completing models and metamodels. To provide input for the recommendation engine, we convert training data into a graph-based format, making use of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The extracted graphs are then fed as input for a recommendation engine based on graph kernel similarity, which performs predictions to provide modelers with relevant recommendations to complete the partially specified (meta)models. In this paper, we extend the proposed tool in different dimensions, resulting in a more advanced recommender system. Firstly, we equip it with the ability to support recommendations for JSON schema that provides a model representation of data handling operations. Secondly, we introduce additional preprocessing steps and a kernel similarity function based on item frequency, aiming to enhance the capabilities, providing more precise recommendations. Thirdly, we study the proposed enhancements, conducting a well-structured evaluation by considering three real-world datasets. Although the increasing size of the training data negatively affects the computation time, the experimental results demonstrate that the newly introduced mechanisms allow MORGAN to improve its recommendations compared to its preceding version.},

This paper offers a primer on hardware acceleration of image processing, focusing on embedded, real-time applications. We then survey the landscape of High Level Synthesis technologies that are amenable to the domain, as well as new-generation Hardware Description Languages, and present our ongoing work on IMP-lang, a language for early stage design of heterogeneous image processing systems. We show that hardware acceleration is not just a process of converting a piece of computation into an equivalent hardware system: that naive approach offers, in most cases, little benefit. Instead, acceleration must take into account how data is streamed throughout the system, and optimize that streaming accordingly. We show that the choice of tooling plays an important role in the results of acceleration. Different tools, in function of the underlying language paradigm, produce wildly different results across performance, size, and power consumption metrics. Finally, we show that bringing heterogeneous considerations to the language level offers significant advantages to early design estimation, allowing designers to partition their algorithms more efficiently, iterating towards a convergent design that can then be implemented across heterogeneous elements accordingly.},

  abstract  = {The paper contributes to unveil how drivers—either human or not—may lose control of road vehicles after a disturbance. First, a simple vehicle-and-driver model is considered: Its motion is characterized by the existence of limit cycles whose amplitude depend on vehicle forward velocity (both oversteering and understeering vehicles may exibit this property). Such limit cycles are originated by a Hopf bifurcation occurring at a relatively high vehicle forward velocity. A mathematical proof of the existence of Hopf bifurcations is given. The existence of Hopf bifurcations and saddle limit cycles is confirmed by experimental tests performed by a dynamic driving simulator with a complex vehicle model and human in the loop. By a Zubov method, a Lyapunov function is derived to compute the region of asymptotic stability for the simple vehicle-and-driver model. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for global asymptotic stability. Such a condition refers to the variation of the kinetic energy which must vanish at the end of the disturbed motion. This occurrence has been detected at the driving simulator too. Just a single stable equilibrium has been found inside the domain of attraction in all of the examined cases.},

  abstract  = {The utilization of big Earth data has provided insights into the planet we inhabit in unprecedented dimensions and scales. Unraveling the concealed causal connections within intricate data holds paramount importance for attaining a profound comprehension of the Earth system. Statistical methods founded on correlation have predominated in Earth system science (ESS) for a long time. Nevertheless, correlation does not imply causation, especially when confronted with spurious correlations resulting from big data. Consequently, traditional correlation and regression methods are inadequate for addressing causation related problems in the Earth system. In recent years, propelled by advancements in causal theory and inference methods, particularly the maturity of causal discovery and causal graphical models, causal inference has demonstrated vigorous vitality in various research directions in the Earth system, such as regularities revealing, processes understanding, hypothesis testing, and physical models improving. This paper commences by delving into the origins, connotations, and development of causality, subsequently outlining the principal frameworks of causal inference and the commonly used methods in ESS. Additionally, it reviews the applications of causal inference in the main branches of the Earth system and summarizes the challenges and development directions of causal inference in ESS. In the big Earth data era, as an important method of big data analysis, causal inference, along with physical model and machine learning, can assist the paradigm transformation of ESS from a model-driven paradigm to a paradigm of integration of both mechanism and data. Looking forward, the establishment of a meticulously structured and normalized causal theory can act as a foundational cornerstone for fostering causal cognition in ESS and propel the leap from fragmented research towards a comprehensive understanding of the Earth system.},

  abstract  = {Friction dampers are widely used in vibration control of mechanical and civil architectures as a highly robust contact-based energy dissipation strategy. The energy dissipation principle of electromagnetic dampers is to convert the mechanical energy of vibration into electrical energy through a mechanical–magnetic–electric coupling mechanism and dissipate it through an external load circuit or store it in a battery or capacitor. It should be noted that the frictional energy dissipation is displacement dependent, while the electromagnetic energy dissipation is velocity dependent; hence, a synergistic energy dissipation with a combination of frictional and electromagnetic elements can be implemented to obtain satisfactory vibration suppression. This work presents a bi-stable energy scavenging inspired dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) consisting of negative stiffness spring components, electromagnetic conversion elements and friction pairs. The multiple periodic inter-well motion and chaotic motion are understood to illuminate the efficient energy shunt contributed by the bi-stable mechanism. The effects of mass ratio, potential barrier height and friction force on the energy scavenging and vibration suppression performance of this proposed prototype are parametrically analyzed. Numerical simulations have found that the bi-stable DVA with small mass ratio has a significant attenuation effect on the vibration energy of the host structure excited by harmonic excitation or transient shocks. The results indicate that an increase in the barrier height of the bi-stable oscillator leads to an increase in the optimal mass ratio required to achieve optimal energy dissipation efficiency. The small mass ratio bi-stable damper can achieve the best vibration suppression performance by actively regulating the friction force according to the change of ambient vibration. In addition, it is evident that the presence of critical friction minimizes the vibration displacement and energy of the host structure. However, when the friction force exceeds the critical threshold, the dynamic response of the host structure is amplified and the vibration energy increases, which is not conducive to vibration control. Therefore, implementing an appropriate friction force can improve the devastating dynamic response of the structure and facilitate the conversion of vibration energy into available energy.},

  abstract  = {In micro-electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) using the non-hollow circular cross-section tool electrode with the side flushing technique, when the aspect ratio of machined micro-hole is expected to be further increased, the discharge debris expelling speed and the working fluid renewal efficiency are weakened, which hinders the improvement of machining efficiency and accuracy with increased machining depth. In order to reveal the flow behavior of the working fluid in the micro-EDM gap, so as to realize the high-precision and high-efficiency machining of micro-hole with high aspect ratio, a three-phase flow simulation model of fluid, bubble, and debris is established in Fluent under the ideal assumption that the spark discharges occur continuously to generate high-pressure bubbles. The simulation results show that when the boundary condition of the flushing pressure at the side gap entrance is set to 0, the pressure wave emitted when the high-pressure bubble expands, which is formed by the instantaneous gasification of the working fluid between electrodes under high temperature, is the source of pneumatic force that drives the working fluid flow at the micron scale. Affected by the gap flow channel structure and the viscous resistance from inner wall, the flow velocity direction of the fluid dragging the discharge debris to rise up and expel will change, forming a dynamic alternation process of flowing into and out of the side machining gap entry. As the machining depth increases, due to the energy attenuation of the pressure wave propagating from the bottom gap to the side gap entrance, the expelling speed of the discharge debris decreases exponentially at the side gap entrance, resulting in the reduced machining efficiency and accuracy. However, when the simulated bubble generation frequency is increased to the megahertz level, the expelling efficiency of debris has a step-like improvement. The continuous and high-frequency generation of high-pressure bubbles can maintain a high pressure gradient in the bottom gap, and the discharge debris is able to continuously move upward without falling back to accumulate in the bottom gap, which is beneficial to the stable and smooth machining process, realizing the high-precision and high-efficiency machining of micro-hole with high aspect ratio.},

  abstract  = {Abstract As a demonstrated and foremost approach of extracting the key features from corrupted observations, tensor robust principal component analysis has been considered in various fields of data processing related to tensors. It is usually modeled as a low-rank and sparse tensor decomposition problem and can be solved by minimizing a simple convex program. However, convex optimization methods often fail to deeply explore the rank and sparsity of tensors, which leads to suboptimality. Based on tensor singular value decomposition, in this work, we introduce generalized nonconvex regularizers accommodating most popular nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) surrogate functions to be used as effective approximations of the tensor rank function and 
$$\ell _{0}$$
 ℓ 0 -norm. The established unified frame equips universality for a large group of nonconvex surrogate functions. Moreover, we consider tube-wise sparse noise in addition to entry-wise sparse noise, which provides a better way of handling structured corrupted observations arising from practical issues. We further develop an efficient algorithm with convergence guarantees to implement generalized nonconvex optimization based upon the alternating direction method of multipliers. The satisfactory performance results of the proposed method are verified by simulations and visual inpainting applications. Graphic abstract },

Secondly, the necessary and sufficient condition is given to ensure the stability of the system and achieve the couple-group consensus tracking control, and relax the topology constraint of in-degrees balance by cooperative-competitive interactions.

Organoids derived from stem cells have become an increasingly important tool for studying human development and modeling disease. However, methods are still needed to control and study spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in organoids. Here we combined optogenetics and gene perturbation technologies to activate or knock-down RNA of target genes in programmable spatiotemporal patterns. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we locally activated Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) signaling in an organoid model for human neurodevelopment. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic analyses showed that this local induction was sufficient to generate stereotypically patterned organoids and revealed new insights into SHH ’s contribution to gene regulation in neurodevelopment. With this study, we propose optogenetic perturbations in combination with spatial transcriptomics as a powerful technology to reprogram and study cell fates and tissue patterning in organoids.},

With this focus on citizens, districts that use smart technologies provide a litmus test, the results of which will indicate how to design smart green information systems that better meet the needs and desires of citizens. To date, however, guidelines on how to design such green information systems in urban areas or actively involve citizens in this process are few and far between. In recognition and remedy of this shortage, the study draws on the design science research paradigm to develop seven design principles for citizen-centric green information systems that can be used in sustainable smart districts. These principles are evaluated in 15 semi-structured interviews and a prototype of a mobile district app for a citizen-centric green information system is instantiated. By taking this citizen-centric perspective, the paper fosters the active involvement of humans in the design of sustainable urban environments.},

  abstract  = {Context Web APIs are one of the most used ways to expose application functionality on the Web, and their understandability is important for efficiently using the provided resources. While many API design rules exist, empirical evidence for the effectiveness of most rules is lacking. Objective We therefore wanted to study 1) the impact of RESTful API design rules on understandability, 2) if rule violations are also perceived as more difficult to understand, and 3) if demographic attributes like REST-related experience have an influence on this. Method We conducted a controlled Web-based experiment with 105 participants, from both industry and academia and with different levels of experience. Based on a hybrid between a crossover and a between-subjects design, we studied 12 design rules using API snippets in two complementary versions: one that adhered to a rule and one that was a violation of this rule. Participants answered comprehension questions and rated the perceived difficulty. Results For 11 of the 12 rules, we found that violation performed significantly worse than rule for the comprehension tasks. Regarding the subjective ratings, we found significant differences for 9 of the 12 rules, meaning that most violations were subjectively rated as more difficult to understand. Demographics played no role in the comprehension performance for violation . Conclusions Our results provide first empirical evidence for the importance of following design rules to improve the understandability of Web APIs, which is important for researchers, practitioners, and educators.},

  abstract  = {Sodium and potassium ion channels are significant for generating spiking behaviors in excitable neurons. The marvelous Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) circuit employs time-varying resistors to describe electrophysiological properties of the ion channels and to constrict the relation between membrane potential and ion currents. It is a difficult task to analog implement the marvelous HH circuit, since it contains mixed exponential function for describing the ion currents. To solve and mitigate this issue, a simplified HH circuit with memristive sodium and potassium ion channels is constructed. In the simplified memristive Hodgkin–Huxley (mHH) circuit, a second-order (2nd-order) locally active memristor (LAM) for characterizing sodium ion channel and a first-order (1st-order) LAM for characterizing the potassium ion channel are employed. Numerical simulations employing several numerical tools are utilized to offer unique insight into exploring the dynamical behavior and firing activity of the simplified mHH circuit, which delight that LAMs- and stimulus-related parameters can be used to regulate the generation of various spiking behaviors. Moreover, a PCB-based analog circuit is made by using discrete circuit components and hardware experiment is performed. The experimentally measured results well verify the numerically simulated spiking behaviors. The numerical simulations and experimental confirmations display that the simplified mHH circuit is feasible in producing various neuron firing activities and benefit for developing spike-based applications.},

Abnormal fluctuations in crop production in major exporting countries can cause volatility in food prices and household consumption in importing countries. Here we show that timely forecasting of crop harvest from satellite data over major exporting regions can trigger production response in the opposite hemisphere to offset the short-term fluctuations and stabilize global food supply. Satellite forecasting can reduce the fluctuation extents of country-level prices by 1.1 to 12.5 percentage points for anticipated wheat shortage or surplus in Russia and Ukraine, and even reverse the price shock in importing countries for anticipated soybean shortage in Brazil. Our research demonstrates that by leveraging the seasonal lags in crop calendars between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, operational crop monitoring from satellite data can provide a mechanism to improve global food security.},

  abstract  = {Cloud computing is an evolving paradigm whose adoption has been increasing over the last few years. This fact has led to the growth of the cloud computing market, together with fierce competition for the leading market share, with an increase in the number of cloud service providers. Novel techniques are continuously being proposed to increase the cloud service provider’s profitability. However, only those techniques that are proven not to hinder the service agreements are considered for production clouds. Analysing the expected behaviour and performance of the cloud infrastructure is challenging, as the repeatability and reproducibility of experiments on these systems are made difficult by the large number of users concurrently accessing the infrastructure. To this, must be added the complications of using different provisioning policies, managing several workloads, and applying different resource configurations. Therefore, in order to alleviate these issues, we present Simcan2Cloud, a discrete-event-based simulator for modelling and simulating cloud computing environments. Simcan2Cloud focuses on modelling and simulating the behaviour of the cloud provider with a high level of detail, where both the cloud infrastructure and the interactions of the users with the cloud are integrated in the simulated scenarios. For this purpose, Simcan2Cloud supports different resource allocation policies, service level agreements (SLAs), and an intuitive and complete API for including new management policies. Finally, a thorough experimental study to measure the suitability and applicability of Simcan2Cloud, using both real-world traces and synthetic workloads, is presented.},

  abstract  = {In the process of software development, the ability to localize faults is crucial for improving the efficiency of debugging. Generally speaking, detecting and repairing errant behavior at an early stage of the development cycle considerably reduces costs and development time. Researchers have tried to utilize various methods to locate the faulty codes. However, failing test cases usually account for a small portion of the test suite, which inevitably leads to the class-imbalance phenomenon and hampers the effectiveness of fault localization. Accordingly, in this work, we propose a new fault localization approach named ContextAug. After obtaining dynamic execution through test cases, ContextAug traces these executions to build an information model; subsequently, it constructs a failure context with propagation dependencies to intersect with new model-domain failing test samples synthesized by the minimum variability of the minority feature space. In contrast to traditional test generation directly from the input domain, ContextAug seeks a new perspective to synthesize failing test samples from the model domain, which is much easier to augment test suites. Through conducting empirical research on real large-sized programs with 13 state-of-the-art fault localization approaches, ContextAug could significantly improve fault localization effectiveness with up to 54.53},

  abstract  = {The atmospheric methane trend is not fully understood. Here we investigate the role of the main sink, the main natural source, and anthropogenic emissions on the methane growth rate over the last three decades using numerical models and emission inventories. We find that the long-term trend is driven by increased anthropogenic methane emissions, while wetland emissions show large variability and can modify the trend. The anthropogenic influence on hydroxyl radical, through nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions, has modified the trend over the last decades and contributed to the atmospheric methane stabilization from 2000 to 2007. The hydroxyl radical increase prior to this stabilization period might have contributed to the decline in the isotopic ratio after 2007 due to the time dependent isotopic response of hydroxyl radical. Emission reductions due to COVID-19 restrictions via the influence on hydroxyl radical, possibly contributed to approximately two thirds of the increase in methane growth from 2019 to 2020. Atmospheric methane trends over recent decades are driven by anthropogenic emissions with modifying effects of hydroxyl radical through anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide and variable wetland emissions, suggest simulations from a combined numerical modelling approach.},

  abstract  = {Several IoT platforms have been proposed to support and facilitate the development of IoT applications. Unfortunately, using an IoT platform makes the developed application strongly dependent on the specific platform’s functionalities. This reduces the portability of the IoT application that may require significant adaptations, or a complete re-design, for being migrated towards other platforms. To mitigate the lack of IoT application portability, we present X-IoT (read as cross-IoT), a model-driven approach supporting the development of cross-platform IoT applications. X-IoT is based on a Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) and its related notation, whose development has been guided by a deep analysis of IoT application characteristics. Tool support is provided through the ADOxx platform, which allows using the DSML to model platform-independent IoT applications, that can be successively refined and deployed on selected IoT platforms. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through a meeting room scenario.},

  abstract  = {Attention is currently being focused on DevOps, which aims to reduce software development time by means of close collaboration between the development and operations areas. However, little effort has been made to determine the role of requirements management in DevOps. The objective of this study is to help both researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of the best practices regarding requirements engineering in DevOps and identifying which areas still need to be investigated. A multivocal mapping study has, therefore, been carried out in order to study which methodologies, techniques and tools are used to support requirements management in DevOps environments. After applying the review protocol, 37 papers from formal literature and 14 references from grey literature were selected for analysis. The general conclusions obtained after analysing these papers were that, within DevOps, more attention should be paid to: (1) the reuse of requirements in order to identify systems and software artefacts that can serve as a basis for the specification of new projects; (2) the communication of requirements between the different areas of an organisation and the stakeholders of a project; (3) the traceability of requirements in order to identify the relationship with other requirements, artefacts, tasks and processes; (4) non-functional requirements in order to identify the requirements of the operations area in the early phases of a project; and finally (5) specific requirements tools that should be seamlessly integrated into the DevOps toolchain. All these issues must be considered without ignoring the agile and continuous practices of development, operations and business teams. More effort must also be made to validate new methodologies in industry so as to assess and determine their strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract  = {Longitudinal processes often unfold concurrently where the growth patterns of two or more longitudinal outcomes are associated. Additionally, if the study under investigation is long, the growth curves may exhibit nonconstant change with respect to time. Multiple existing studies have developed multivariate growth models with nonlinear functional forms to explore joint development where two longitudinal records are correlated over time. However, the relationship between multiple longitudinal outcomes may also be unidirectional. Accordingly, it is of interest to estimate regression coefficients of such unidirectional paths. One statistical tool for such analyses is longitudinal mediation models. In this study, we develop two models to evaluate mediational processes where the linear–linear piecewise functional form is utilized to capture the change patterns. We define the mediational process as either the baseline covariate or the change in covariate influencing the change in the mediator, which, in turn, affects the change in the outcome. We present the proposed models through simulation studies and real-world data analyses. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed mediational models can provide unbiased and accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities with a 95 },

The greenhouse model was validated through an experimental real-scale greenhouse. To make the proposed system more flexible, an auxiliary control system is used to easily monitor the greenhouse needs and ensure its satisfaction. The findings revealed that the integrated system, with its two main subsystems and its regulation device, successfully ensures the greenhouse irrigation, the humidification needs and provides an optimal plant growth.

  abstract  = {In this letter, a control strategy comprising velocity and yaw rate controllers is proposed for a real four-wheel vehicle in a leader-follower formation when the leader vehicle drives at high speed, i.e., 100 km/h. Since vehicle stability plays an increasingly important role as speed increases, vehicle dynamics must be considered in vehicle formation control. Therefore, to increase the accuracy of the formation geometric model, bicycle model-based leader-follower formation models are suggested, which are denoted as the follower (F) bicycle model and the leader-follower (LF) bicycle model. Then, the velocity and yaw rate control of the follower vehicle is designed. In addition, vehicle longitudinal and wheel dynamic models are considered in the velocity control to generate the wheel torque. Finally, the control gains are determined under conditions that satisfy the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, which guarantees the stability of the vehicle simplified as a first-order lag model. The performance of the proposed leader-follower bicycle model and controllers are strictly demonstrated by implementing vehicle dynamics simulations in cases when vehicles in a formation drive at high speeds. The simulation results confirm that the suggested formation control strategy can be applied to real four-wheel vehicles under high-speed conditions on various types of paths, in comparison with the unicycle model-based formation shape model.},

However, there is little insight of how such evaluation happens in the context of CSE. To cover this gap, we investigate in this work the state of the art of continuous evaluation of software architectures in CSE, including agile processes like SCRUM. For this, we systematically examine the literature to collect and summarize evidence. Our results show a diversity of means for evaluating architectures in continuous mode to support the continuous evolution of systems. We also found how such evaluation has been incorporated within continuous development processes and agile processes like SCRUM and Crystal. We finally derive the main trends and open issues in the area, aiming to support the community to better understand and further consolidate the field of continuous evaluation of software architectures.},

In this work, we give a complete list of de Sitter solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation (SCE), where classical gravity is coupled to the expected value of a renormalized stress–energy tensor of a free quantum field in the Bunch–Davies state. To achieve this, we explicitly determine the stress–energy tensor associated with the Bunch–Davies state using the recently proposed “moment approach” on the cosmological coordinate patch of de Sitter space. From the energy component of the SCE, we thus obtain an analytic consistency equation for the model’s parameters which has to be fulfilled by solutions to the SCE. Using this equation, we then investigate the number of solutions and the structure of the solution set in dependency on the coupling parameter of the quantum field to the scalar curvature and renormalization constants using analytic arguments in combination with numerical evidence. We also identify parameter sets where multiple expansion rates separated by several orders of magnitude are possible. Potentially for such parameter settings, a fast (semi-stable) expansion in the early universe could be compatible with a late-time “Dark Energy-like” behavior of the universe.},

  abstract  = {Earlier software development processes (SDPs), such as waterfall processes, were mainly focused on process steps and did not address people- and product-related issues. Emergence of Software development methodologies (SDM) has created a new paradigm for developing software systems. A SDM is a special kind of technically engineered framework for organizing SDPs; this framework is expected to specify three main interwoven elements, namely people, products, and process. It has since become evident that it is impossible to provide a general-purpose SDM for developing all the various kinds of software systems, and it has thus become essential to construct the most appropriate methodology for the system development situation in hand, a practice commonly called Situational Method Engineering (SME). The problem with existing SME methods is lack of adequate attention to the role of people who might seek or possess valuable knowledge about the project situation. This knowledge can be tacit information that is hidden in the developer’s mind, or it might be explicitly available. This paper proposes a knowledge management (KM)-driven and DevOps-based SME method as a new integrated multi-view methodological paradigm that satisfies the need for sharing human experience in engineering SDMs. The method has been proposed by reusing general SME practices and complementing them by embedding appropriate KM and DevOps practices to alleviate the weaknesses of previous SME methods. Furthermore, the proposed method has been evaluated through four case studies and also by conducting a criteria-based comparison with eight prominent SME methods.},

Red mud is a highly alkaline solid waste with very fine particles produced in the production of alumina from bauxite, which is difficult to utilize comprehensively. In this paper, microbial mineralization is applied to the treatment of sintering red mud, and the mineralized products with good cementation characteristics generated in the reaction process are used to cement and solidify the red mud, so as to realize the purpose of using red mud to produce building materials and foundation filling materials. The test shows that mineralizing bacteria can overcome the characteristics of strong alkalinity, high salinity, and fine and uniform particles of red mud, the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the red mud sample can reach about 3 MPa and the maximum amount of the newly formed carbonate is 27},

  abstract  = {Global climate change, expected to be one of the most severe challenges that human beings have ever encountered, has had far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and humans, among which the potentially increasing chance of violent conflict has raised attention recently. However, several years of research have produced no consensus regarding whether climate variability affects the risk of armed conflict and how it may affect conflict. In this study, we built a geographically disaggregated method to explore the relationship between climate variability from normal climate conditions and armed conflicts both on a local and regional scale. With the 10,993 conflict records acquired in 25 African countries over 16 years from 2000 to 2015, we estimated the effects of temperature and wet day variability on conflicts in agricultural and non-agricultural areas, respectively, on gridded 1° resolution. The results showed that deviations from the normal climate have a systematical impact on the risk of conflict: The risk of violence rises with increasing deviations from the temperature norms in both non-agricultural and agricultural areas. Regarding the rainfall variability, in non-agricultural areas, the risk of violence grows with increasing anomalous wet days, either more or fewer days than the annual average, while in agricultural areas, increases in violence risk only exhibit under the impact of fewer wet days than the annual average. We expect these findings would provide empirical support for policymakers and relevant organizations who need to prepare additional law enforcement and/or peacekeeping resources when climatic anomalies are detected.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Accurate heat load prediction is essential for heat production and refined management of district heating systems (DHSs). More advanced technology can often achieve more accurate forecasts. This paper suggests using temporal convolutional network (TCN) and categorical boosting (CatBoost) for heat load prediction. To test the performance of TCN and CatBoost in heat load prediction missions, two additional benchmark models, the decision tree model (DT) and the statistically based multiple linear regression (MLR), are built for comparison. A DHS in Tianjin, China, is used as the study case. Two historical operational characters (day-ahead heat load and hour-ahead heat load) and four meteorological characters (outdoor temperature, relative humidity, wind scale, and air quality index) are selected as input features for the models. The prediction results of every model on the test set are displayed and discussed. The experimental findings indicate that the prediction results of TCN and CatBoost are more accurate than the traditional prediction models, while the modeling process of CatBoost is simpler. Overall, TCN and CatBoost are potential heat load prediction methods.},

  abstract  = {A new small-scale slurry shield machine including a complete slurry-circulation system was designed to simulate the advancing process of slurry-shield tunneling. A series of model tests were thereby carried out to evaluate the performance of this slurry-shield machine. The test results show that the face stability is significantly related to the slurry pressure in chamber at relative depth C / D  = 1 or 1.5. However, the rotation speed of cutterhead should be paid more attention than the slurry pressure in the case C / D  = 0.7. This indicates that the rotation speed of the cutterhead and the slurry volume should be tightly controlled when the P _ s increased by 100 kPa in the chamber when the case C / D was less than 1.0 in the prototype project. With respect to this cohesive-frictional soil, the ground movement ahead of the face is very sensitive to slurry pressure fluctuation and the arching effect in soil is rather weaker in all cases. A comparison with quantitative predictions by theoretical method shows that the minimal admissible slurry pressures calculated by the designed method are close to the measured values, while the designed method overestimates the maximum allowable slurry pressure. The results yield from theoretical model show good agreement with the measurement of critical P _ s at the relative depth C / D  < 1 while the theoretical could not precisely predict either the measured P _ sl or the measured P _ su for deeply-buried tunnels. A larger admissible range of P _ s is thereby available for deep-burial tunneling project than for shallow tunnel.},

  abstract  = {Philosophers of mathematics often rely on the historical progress of mathematics in support of mathematical realism. These histories typically build on formal semantic tools to evaluate the changes in mathematics, and on these bases present later mathematical concepts as refined versions of earlier concepts which are taken to be vague. Claiming that this view does not apply to mathematical concepts in general, we present a case-study concerning projective geometry, for which we apply the tools of cognitive linguistics to analyse the developmental trajectory of the domain. On the basis of this analysis, we argue for the existence of two conceptually incompatible inferential structures, occurring at distinct moments in history, both of which yield the same projective geometric theorems; the first invoked by the French mathematicians Girard Desargues (1591–1661) and Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867), and the second characterising a specific modern mode. We demonstrate that neither of these inferential structures can be considered as a refinement of the other. This case of conceptual development presents an issue to the standard account of progress and its bearing on mathematical realism. Our analysis suggests that the features that distinguish the underlying conceptually incompatible inferential structures are invisible to the standard application of the tools of formal semantics. Thus this case-study stands as an example of the manner and necessity of linguistics—specifically cognitive linguistics—to inform the philosophy of mathematics.},

  abstract  = {Due to the cold water temperatures, the East China Sea (ECS) is usually unfavorable for typhoon development. Recently, in a rare event, Typhoon Bavi (2020) reached major typhoon status and became the strongest typhoon in the ECS in the past decade. Based on in situ observations and model simulations, we discover that this typhoon is fueled by a marine heatwave, which creates a very warm ocean condition with sea surface temperature (SST) exceeding 30 °C. Also, because of suppressed typhoon-induced SST cooling caused by the shallow water depth (41 m) and strong salinity stratification (river runoff) within the ECS, the SST beneath the typhoon remains relatively high and enhances the total heat flux for the typhoon. More interestingly, due to the fair weather ahead of the typhoon, we find that the rapid development of this marine heatwave is likely, in part, attributed to the typhoon itself. As the risks from typhoons and marine heatwaves are heightening under climate change, this study provides important insights into the interaction between typhoons and marine heatwaves.},

Here, the authors develop a multi-omics data-based technique for large-scale and rapid cloning of quantitative genes of tassel branch number and discovery of selection signatures in maize breeding. Genetic dissection of agronomic traits is important for crop improvement and global food security. Phenotypic variation of tassel branch number (TBN), a major breeding target, is controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The lack of large-scale QTL cloning methodology constrains the systematic dissection of TBN, which hinders modern maize breeding. Here, we devise QTG-Miner, a multi-omics data-based technique for large-scale and rapid cloning of quantitative trait genes (QTGs) in maize. Using QTG-Miner, we clone and verify seven genes underlying seven TBN QTLs. Compared to conventional methods, QTG-Miner performs well for both major- and minor-effect TBN QTLs. Selection analysis indicates that a substantial number of genes and network modules have been subjected to selection during maize improvement. Selection signatures are significantly enriched in multiple biological pathways between female heterotic groups and male heterotic groups. In summary, QTG-Miner provides a large-scale approach for rapid cloning of QTGs in crops and dissects the genetic base of TBN for further maize breeding.},

  abstract  = {Emerging limitations on climate and low-carbon technology would require adjusting our 15.C climate change mitigation pathways. However, this could increase average annual emissions reductions to around 3GtCO_2/year using a broad portfolio of mitigation measures. Understanding how 1.5 °C pathways could adjust in light of new adverse information, such as a reduced 1.5 °C carbon budget, or slower-than-expected low-carbon technology deployment, is critical for planning resilient pathways. We use an integrated assessment model to explore potential pathway adjustments starting in 2025 and 2030, following the arrival of new information. The 1.5 °C target remains achievable in the model, in light of some adverse information, provided a broad portfolio of technologies and measures is still available. If multiple pieces of adverse information arrive simultaneously, average annual emissions reductions near 3 GtCO_2/yr for the first five years following the pathway adjustment, compared to 2 GtCO_2/yr in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic began. Moreover, in these scenarios of multiple simultaneous adverse information, by 2050 mitigation costs are 4-5 times as high as a no adverse information scenario, highlighting the criticality of developing a wide range of mitigation options, including energy demand reduction options.},

However, the VFS model constructed based on the work of Kennedy and O’Hagan overemphasizes the linear correlations between high-fidelity and low-fidelity models, thereby limiting the generalizability and application scenarios of VFS models. To address this issue, this study proposes a nonlinear integrated bi-fidelity (NI-BFS) model, which maps predictions of the low-fidelity model to the high-fidelity level in a nonlinear manner. This approach strengthens the model’s ability to learn the nonlinear correlation relationship between high-fidelity and low-fidelity models and alleviates the difficulty of fitting the discrepancy function. The performance of the NI-BFS model has been validated through a series of comparative experiments, where four advanced VFS models were used as benchmark models. Additionally, the NI-BFS model’s robustness and practical applicability have been investigated. The results demonstrate that the NI-BFS model outperforms the other benchmark models in all cases.},

  abstract  = {Background To allow for normal school attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic, regular testing of students was introduced in the autumn 2021 in Norway to manage COVID-19 transmission. We mapped the experiences of five stakeholders (parents, students, school staff and administration, contact tracing teams) regarding the implementation of regular testing in primary and secondary schools in Oslo and Viken counties, to assess the acceptability through different indicators and improve future guidelines. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between October and November 2021 to explore experiences of implementation, compliance, satisfaction, difficulties, concerns, confidence in regular testing, quality of teaching and school attendance. Five stakeholder groups were invited to participate: contact tracing teams; school administrators and employees in primary, lower secondary, and upper-secondary school; students in upper-secondary school and parents of primary and lower secondary students. Bivariate analyses were performed for students, parents, and school employees groups. Descriptive analyses were done for contact tracing teams and school administrators. Results Four thousand five hundred sixty-five participants were included in our study. School attendance increased for most of the students in primary and lower secondary schools in Oslo and Viken after the implementation of regular testing. Students across all school levels reported high testing compliance and satisfaction with the implementation. Compliance was significantly associated with an increasing number of weekly tests across all school levels up to two weekly tests. Contact tracing teams were less satisfied with the cooperation with the educational authorities compared to the school employees. Higher educational level of parents was significantly associated with decreased concern of their children getting infected at school after regular testing implementation. Concerned parents were more likely to keep children at home from school, to protect all household members from becoming infected. Lack of time and communication were reported as challenging factors to implementation. Conclusion Compliance, satisfaction, and confidence in regular testing of COVID-19 were high among stakeholders. An acceptable testing regime for a future regular testing implementation would be a home-based, bi-weekly test. Increased awareness of the importance of school attendance, safety of regular testing along with good communication and role clarification should be prioritized for stakeholders involved in regular testing.},

  abstract  = {Modeling is an essential and challenging activity in any engineering environment. It implies some hard-to-train skills such as abstraction and communication. Teachers, project leaders, and tool vendors have a hard time teaching or training their students, co-workers, or users. Gamification refers to the exploitation of gaming mechanisms for serious purposes, like promoting behavioral changes, soliciting participation and engagement in activities, etc. We investigate the introduction of gaming mechanisms in modeling tasks with the primary goal of supporting learning/training. The result has been the realization of a gamified modeling environment named PapyGame. In this article, we present the approach adopted for PapyGame implementation, the details on the gamification elements involved, and the derived conceptual architecture required for applying gamification in any modeling environment. Moreover, to demonstrate the benefits of using PapyGame for learning/training modeling, a set of user experience evaluations have been conducted. Correspondingly, we report the obtained results together with a set of future challenges we consider as critical to make gamified modeling a more effective education/training approach.},

  abstract  = {Various uncertainties existing in the manufacturing process, such as imperfect cable lengths and uncertain boundary node locations, will unavoidably deteriorate the shape precision of cable-network antennas. In this paper, an adaptive Kriging-based method is developed to investigate the global sensitivity of uncertain parameters and discover the influential factors. Existing strategies in literature usually use relative error of function values to measure the metamodel accuracy and then to determine when the sequential sampling process should be stopped. However, these indicators are mostly developed based on function values, not the sensitivity indices. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how small the indicators should be for efficiently defining an accurate metamodel for sensitivity analysis. In this paper, a straightforward sensitivity-based indicator is developed to measure the metamodel accuracy, which is defined as the weighted average of absolute errors of sensitivity values between two successive iterations. A use-controlled threshold, combined with the new indicator, can provide an automatic stopping criterion for the adaptive metamodel building process. The proposed method can provide a uniform framework to detect the convergence status effectively for problems with different uncertainties and dimensions. A numerical example and two cable-network antenna examples considering different manufacturing uncertainties are illustrated to validate the new method.},

  abstract  = {Process models are important for supporting organizations in documenting, understanding and monitoring their business. When these process models become outdated, they need to be revised to accurately describe the new status quo of the processes in the organization. Process model repair techniques help at automatically revising the existing model from behavior traced in event logs. So far, such techniques have focused on identifying which parts of the model to change and how to change them, but they do not use knowledge from practitioners to inform the revision. As a consequence, fragments of the model may change in a way that defies existing regulations or represents outdated information that was wrongly considered from the event log. This paper uses concepts from theory revision to provide formal foundations for process model repair that exploits domain knowledge. Specifically, it conceptualizes (1) what are unchangeable fragments in the model and (2) the role that various traces in the event log should play when it comes to model repair. A scenario of use is presented that demonstrates the benefits of this conceptualization. The current state of existing process model repair techniques is compared against the proposed concepts. The results show that only two existing techniques partially consider the concepts presented in this paper for model repair.},

  abstract  = {The leaf area index (LAI) shows a significant increasing trend from global to regional scales, which is known as greening. Greening will further enhance photosynthesis, but it is unclear whether the contribution of greening has exceeded the CO_2 fertilization effect and become the dominant factor in the gross primary productivity (GPP) variation. We took the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of China, where cropland and natural vegetation are significantly greening, as an example. Based on the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS) and Revised-EC-LUE models, the GPP in the YRD from 2001 to 2020 was simulated, and attribution analysis of the interannual variation in GPP was performed. In addition, the reliability of the GPP simulated by the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) in the area was further investigated. The research results showed that GPP in the YRD had three significant characteristics consistent with LAI: (1) GPP showed a significant increasing trend; (2) the multiyear mean and trend of natural vegetation GPP were higher than those of cropland GPP; and (3) cropland GPP showed double-high peak characteristics. The BEPS and Revised-EC-LUE models agreed that the effect of LAI variation (4.29 Tg C yr^−1 for BEPS and 2.73 Tg C yr^−1 for the Revised-EC-LUE model) determined the interannual variation in GPP, which was much higher than the CO_2 fertilization effect (2.29 Tg C yr^−1 for BEPS and 0.67 Tg C yr^−1 for the Revised-EC-LUE model). The GPP simulated by the 7 DGVMs showed a huge inconsistency with the GPP estimated by remote sensing models. The deviation of LAI simulated by DGVM might be a potential cause for this phenomenon. Our study highlights that in significant greening areas, LAI has dominated GPP variation, both spatially and temporally, and DGVM can correctly simulate GPP only if it accurately simulates LAI variation.},

  abstract  = {Context-aware systems adapt their services to the user’s intentions and environment to improve the user experience. However, how to evaluate the quality of these systems in terms of user perception and context recognition is still an open problem. Our goal in this work is to evaluate the Quality-in-Use (QinU) for context-aware software systems according to the ISO/IEC 25010 standard and in an automated manner. This evaluation is oriented to be model-based, with domain specification and log data as input, while quality metrics and representations of users’ behavior as output. In this process, we use probabilistic models to discover user patterns, heuristic metrics as QinU estimation, clustering techniques to obtain user profiles according to their QinU, and feature selection to identify relevant factors of context. We propose a framework for assessing the QinU in context-aware software systems called Framework for Assessing Quality-in-use of Software (FAQuiS). FAQuiS includes a set of models to represent all dimensions of context, a methodology to apply the quality analysis to any system, and a set of tools and metrics to support and automate the process. We seek to test the impact and ease of integration in the industry for this framework. A case study in a company allows us to validate the applicability in a real environment. We analyze the mechanisms that support the QinU evaluation in context-aware systems, the feasibility of the QinU quantification, and the suitability of the integration in companies. Compared to previous works, our proposal offers a novel data-driven approach with general-purpose and industrial viability. FAQuiS can be used as a solution to assess the QinU based on the ISO 25010 standard and the models of user behaviors in different contexts. This solution analyzes the context changes in the user interaction, can quantify the quality loss in these contexts, and does not require big efforts to be integrated into a software development process.},

The results show that when the cycle is interpreted as a model for the sleep/awake alternation, the duration and sleep offset are influenced by light intensity, daylight duration and noise intensity. Increasing light intensity and duration can lead to a decrease in sleep duration beyond

  abstract  = {The influence of low permeability porous media (LPPM) on contaminant transport dynamics in saturated porous systems was investigated using numerical simulations and temporal moments of contaminant concentrations. Two-dimensional flow and contaminant transport simulations were conducted, considering various parameters such as longitudinal dispersivity (ranging from 15 to 60 m), the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity (ranging from 0.05 to 0.2), retardation factor (ranging from 1 to 4), and hydraulic gradient (ranging from 0.005 to 0.02) for both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous systems. The findings revealed significant differences in the transport behavior of conservative and highly reactive contaminants between the porous systems without and with the LPPM region. The center of mass of contaminant plume and peak concentration zone were observed inside the LPPM region for the heterogeneous porous system, especially during the source off-loading period. Furthermore, asymmetric distributions of the zeroth temporal moment (ZTM), mean residence time (MRT), and variance of the breakthrough curve (BTC) were observed along the longitudinal distance within the LPPM region for heterogeneous porous system, highlighting the impact of heterogeneity on contaminant plume evolution dynamics. The moment analysis results provided insights into the influence of LPPM region on time-averaged contaminant transport dynamics in adjacent porous systems. These findings can help risk managers understand the complex fate and transport dynamics in heterogeneous porous systems. Future studies could explore the modelling of multispecies contaminants in heterogeneous saturated porous systems subjected to fluctuating water table.},

We show that the energy minimization implies the bifurcation from solutions with uniform crack spacing to non uniformly spaced solutions, a phenomenon ignored in the literature for perfect systems. The stability of uniformly spaced solutions crucially depends on the concavity of the elastic compliance of each elastic segment as a function of the segment length. We compute this function and its derivatives numerically with domain-derivative techniques for a large set of geometric and material parameters. Our results indicate that the change of concavity and the related instability is a robust qualitative property that becomes quantitatively relevant in the case of laminates with thin and soft outer layers.},

Minimum road damage and goods damage are taken as design criteria for design. The objective function and constraint calculation in suspension design involve dynamic responses of the vehicle that has a high computational cost. Hence, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for fast convergence. Proposed hybrid GA is designed using the selection method of two different genetic algorithms, i.e. non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and 2-objective geometry inspired genetic algorithm (2GIGA). Proposed hybrid GA is tested for different benchmarking optimization problems along with suspension optimization problems. Two types of suspension systems, passive and semi-active suspensions, are designed. A semi-active suspension system design involves designing a controller for a controllable damper along with passive elements. An improvised control law using a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is used for the semi-active suspension system of multi-axle HGV. This control law is designed in such a way that it will eliminate the need for a passive damper in a semi-active suspension system. Results of the proposed hybrid GA are compared with the NSGA-II and 2GIGA. The proposed hybrid GA is performing better and saves significant computational cost for the suspension design of HGV.},

  abstract  = {In recent decades, China has experienced intense land use and cover change (LUCC). In this study, we modeled and explored the possible effects and mechanisms of realistic LUCCs on surface temperatures in China during 1984–2013 using the Regional Climate Model (RegCM) based on the annual dynamic LUCCs derived from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS-GLC) data. We compared two sets of ensemble experiments, one with a fixed LUCC scenario (fixed at 1984) and the other with a dynamic LUCC scenario (annual conversions from 1984 to 2013). The results showed that LUCCs in recent decades have been characterized by reforestation (accompanied by a reduction in cropland) in southern China, grassland-to-cropland conversions in North and Northeast China and bare land-to-grassland conversions in northwestern China. Such LUCCs led primarily to significant cooling of the daily maximum surface temperature ( T _ smax ) by approximately − 0.3 to − 0.6 °C in summer and autumn over the reforestation areas of southern China, followed by moderate cooling (  − 0.2 °C) of the daily mean surface temperature ( T _ s ), while the effect on the daily minimum surface temperature ( T _ smin ) was weak (within ± 0.1 °C) and nonsignificant. During winter and spring, the impacts of LUCC on all temperatures were less pronounced. Further investigation revealed that the cooling of T _ smax was dominated by the direct effects of LUCC (over 90},

The level set technique is one of the most often employed in this field, but its main problem is the initial contour selection. To solve this problem and obtain reliable and accurate extraction of ROI, we propose in this work an efficient and robust level set model (ERLSM). More specifically, our model is a hybrid between the conventional level set method (CLS) and the possibilistic c-means clustering (PCMC) method. The main idea of PCMC is to initially divide the input image into clusters. Then, the obtained results are used to initialize and estimate the controlling parameters of the CLS method. Experimental results on X-ray welding images and MRI brain images show that the ERLSM model offers very good performance and confirms its efficiency and robustness against image noise. Moreover, the proposed model has the advantage of high computational speed under different processing conditions. It is able to extract ROIs with high accuracy after very few iterations and eliminates the sensitivity problem of CLS to the initial contour.},

  abstract  = {Facing the increasing annual cybersecurity costs, threat modelling (TM) is a method to consider security as early as possible in the software development life cycle (SDLC). Thereby, TM helps to identify and address security-related design flaws in information systems. As the original TM approach is based on sequential development, it is not aligned with today’s predominantly agile environments. This results in several challenges. However, TM’s implementation in an agile development approach lacks the recommendations on how to tackle these challenges. Therefore, we assess the state-of-the-art of TM challenges and practices in agile environments by conducting a literature review covering 220 papers. Thereby, we identify nine categories of challenges and six categories of practices. We propose a valuable artefact for practitioners by mapping challenges and practices to the agile SDLC and by creating a matrix highlighting how the practices address the challenges of TM in an agile environment.},

  abstract  = {This study investigated the coupling of the wind-driven ocean gyres with the atmospheric westerly jet using an idealised, eddy-resolving, coupled model. An empirical orthogonal function analysis of the low-pass filtered data showed that the ocean gyre variability is dominated by meridional shifts of the western boundary current extension (WBCE) and changes in the strength of the subtropical inertial recirculation zone. On the other hand, the atmospheric potential vorticity (PV) variability is dominated by the growth of standing Rossby wave patterns, while its pressure variability is dominated by a zonally-asymmetric meridional shift of the atmospheric jet. Damping sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the atmosphere was shown to weaken its PV variability and reduce the zonal asymmetry of the jet-shift mode. Singular value decompositions revealed a positive feedback between meridional shifts of the WBCE and the growth of standing Rossby wave disturbances in the atmospheric jet. The atmosphere’s response is controlled by shifts in the meridional eddy heat flux over the SST front which triggers the growth of baroclinic instabilities. This instability growth eventually leads to a large-scale, barotropic pressure response over the eastern ocean basin, or an aforementioned meridional shift of the atmospheric jet. Reduction in the atmospheric resolution inhibits the ability of atmospheric eddies to resolve length scales associated with meridional shifts of the SST front and WBCE. The lack of resolution consequently weakens the influence of ocean gyre variability on the atmospheric jet and reduces the strength of the positive feedback.},

The damage accumulation–energy dissipation method is proposed for the first time to analyze structural damage behavior from the perspective of energy change and mesoscopic damage accumulation. The feasibility of the numerical analysis model was validated by using a three-dimensional discrete element model to simulate the uniaxial compression test of cement-stabilized macadam and compare it with the test results for verification. Subsequently, a fatigue damage test model is established to test the macroscopic mechanical properties and observe the mesoscopic damage in the concrete model structure. This was combined with a comparative analysis of each energy dissipation law. The peak stress, peak strain, and peak elastic modulus errors in uniaxial compression simulations are 0.67},

  abstract  = {The continuous high-intensity and disorderly expansion of construction land in mountainous areas threatens city development; consequently, the scientific guidance of its sustainable development has become a research hotspot. This work aimed to develop a new theoretical framework for predicting land expansion. Based on DMSP/OLS-Landsat 7 data correction from 2000 to 2019, to ensure data reliability, this study quantitatively analysed the expansion law of land-use and land-cover (LULC) in Huayuan, a typical mountainous area in China. Based on the land expansion law, the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was used to predict various types of LULCs in different scenarios. The results showed that (1) the reliability of LULC under multi-source spatio-temporal data correction reached more than 0.97. (2) The expansion law of industrial and mining land, urban living land, and traffic land is sprawl, while rural living land is enclaved and the expansion direction and intensity are obviously different. (3) The scale of land expansion in the natural-oriented scenario was significantly higher than that in the humanism-oriented scenario, with a higher value of 199.33 hm^2. This study expands the case study of land use analysis and prediction, and provides scientific guidance for different land expansion planning, which can avoid the mismatch and waste of land resources. Furthermore, it also deepens the exploration of LULC identification reliability method and enriches the theory of different land use prediction in mountainous areas.},

  abstract  = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) meets extensive applications in the field of prosthesis in the current period. The effectiveness of sEMG in prosthesis applications has been verified by numerous revolutionary developments and extensive research attempts. A large volume of research and literature works have explored and validated the vast use of these signals in prostheses as an assistive technology. The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review and offer a detailed overview of the work record in the prosthesis and myoelectric interfaces framework. This review utilized a systematic search strategy to identify published articles discussing the state-of-the-art applications of sEMG in prostheses (including upper limb prosthesis and lower limb prostheses). Relevant studies were identified using electronic databases such as PubMed, IEEE Explore, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Web of Science. Out of 3791 studies retrieved from the databases, 188 articles were found to be potentially relevant (after screening of abstracts and application of inclusion–exclusion criteria) and included in this review. This review presents an investigative analysis of sEMG-based prosthetic applications to assist the readers in making further advancements in this field. It also discusses the fundamental advantages and disadvantages of using sEMG in prosthetic applications. It also includes some important guidelines to follow in order to improve the performance of sEMG-based prosthesis. The findings of this study support the widespread use of sEMG in prosthetics. It is concluded that sEMG-based prosthesis technology, still in its sprouting phase, requires significant explorations for further development. Supplementary investigations are necessary in the direction of making a seamless mechanism of biomechatronics for sEMG-based prosthesis by cohesive efforts of robotic researchers and biomedical engineers.},

It was meaningful to analyze the latest and long-term changes of net primary production (NPP), which could reflect the human-induced effects on ecological environment. In our study, we used Sen’s slope and Mann–Kendall test to analyze the spatiotemporal changes of NPP. Then, we used fluctuation model and Moran model to reveal the stability and clusters of NPP, respectively. Next, we quantitatively analyzed NPP changes in the perspectives of land use types and provinces. Finally, we used geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to analyze effects of different factors on NPP. The result showed that NPP presented significant increase in most areas of China from 2000 to 2021. Especially, Loess Plateau showed obvious NPP increase. Meanwhile, “high-high” cluster of NPP difference were mainly distributed in the ecological policies-influenced areas. The slope in 5–15° has the highest growth trend, and the slope > 25° has the slowest growth trend. Cropland, forests, and shrub revealed an obvious improvement of NPP, which indicated afforestation and intensive farmed played a key role. Temperature, precipitation, population density, and elevation had significant effects on NPP ( p  < 0.05) in 2000, 2011, and 2021. The degree of effects of human activities was gradually increase in GWR model. In this scenario, related ecological policies had vita influencing on NPP improvement. Our study could provide a help for monitor of ecological environment and government policies.},

  abstract  = {It can be hard for enterprises to make the first move towards circular business models; technologies, information and design need to be linked and dynamic. The present paper proposes a methodology that guides enterprises in integrating environmental and economic aspects during the optimization of products’ end-of-life. It overcomes the current literature limits because it focuses on multiple lifecycle stages and is not limited to end-of-life strategies; secondly, it encompasses both the economic and environmental sustainability perspectives. It expects its implementation to be supported by commercial solutions that enable the quantification of environmental and economic indices, such as degradation index, target price and target cost. The methodology was applied to an industrial case study (an electrospindle) enabling its validation and a deep reflection on the potential consequences of the analyzed scenario throughout the value chain and business departments. The results of the case study show that not all the scenarios are convenient; only the cases that expect components of the pneumatic cylinder group and shaft kit to be re-manufactured are environmentally and economically convenient. The first scenario, which is about disassembling the product to optimize the recycling flow, is currently not feasible from the economic perspective; however, the acquisition of a higher number of used electrospindles could increase its economic convenience, as the disassembly phase may be optimized. De-manufacturing strategies could extend the useful lifecycle of products and introduce additional revenue streams, with intangible effects: information about the use phase, marketing leverage, end-of-life treatment, policies forecasting and strengthened customer relationships. However, it may bring high risks as well, such as cannibalization and investments. For a more aware prioritization of to-be scenarios, future works may exploit more in detail the disassembly time quantification; additionally, the analysis of the main failure modes and events may stand aside from the economic and environmental as-is analysis.

Based on analytical and numerical methodologies, the substructure technique is used to obtain a steady-state dynamic response and the results are verified by experimental and analytical methods. It is demonstrated that fiber orientation has a significant impact on the natural frequencies. The dynamic responses and energy transmission path characteristics are determined and evaluated by forced vibration analysis. The main vibration transmission paths inside the structure are displayed using power flow density vectors. It is demonstrated that the dynamic responses of the plate can be changed considerably by using various fiber placement schemes and passive suppression devices. In addition, it is indicated that the vibration transmission paths are significantly influenced by the tailored fiber angles for improved dynamic performance. Our investigation enhances the understanding of enhanced vibration suppression designs of variable-stiffness composite plates with attached passive devices.},

This article constructs a horizontal ecological compensation mechanism for the Yellow River Basin through indicator variables to analyze the profitability of the participating subjects. Based on data from 83 cities in the Yellow River Basin in 2019, an empirical study was conducted using a binary unordered logit regression model to examine the regional benefits generated by the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism in the Yellow River Basin. The level of urban economic development and ecological environment management significantly affects the profitability of horizontal ecological compensation mechanisms in the Yellow River basin. The heterogeneity analysis finds that the profitability of the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism in the Yellow River basin is stronger in the upstream central and western regions, which are more likely to produce better ecological compensation benefits as recipients of compensation funds. Governments in the Yellow River Basin should strengthen cross-regional cooperation, continuously improve the capacity building and modernization of ecological and environmental governance in the basin, and provide solid institutional guarantees for environmental pollution management in China.},

  abstract  = {Background The distribution of resources can affect animal range sizes, which in turn may alter infectious disease dynamics in heterogenous environments. The risk of pathogen exposure or the spatial extent of outbreaks may vary with host range size. This study examined the range sizes of herbivorous anthrax host species in two ecosystems and relationships between spatial movement behavior and patterns of disease outbreaks for a multi-host environmentally transmitted pathogen. Methods We examined range sizes for seven host species and the spatial extent of anthrax outbreaks in Etosha National Park, Namibia and Kruger National Park, South Africa, where the main host species and outbreak sizes differ. We evaluated host range sizes using the local convex hull method at different temporal scales, within-individual temporal range overlap, and relationships between ranging behavior and species contributions to anthrax cases in each park. We estimated the spatial extent of annual anthrax mortalities and evaluated whether the extent was correlated with case numbers of a given host species. Results Range size differences among species were not linearly related to anthrax case numbers. In Kruger the main host species had small range sizes and high range overlap, which may heighten exposure when outbreaks occur within their ranges. However, different patterns were observed in Etosha, where the main host species had large range sizes and relatively little overlap. The spatial extent of anthrax mortalities was similar between parks but less variable in Etosha than Kruger. In Kruger outbreaks varied from small local clusters to large areas and the spatial extent correlated with case numbers and species affected. Secondary host species contributed relatively few cases to outbreaks; however, for these species with large range sizes, case numbers positively correlated with outbreak extent. Conclusions Our results provide new information on the spatiotemporal structuring of ranging movements of anthrax host species in two ecosystems. The results linking anthrax dynamics to host space use are correlative, yet suggest that, though partial and proximate, host range size and overlap may be contributing factors in outbreak characteristics for environmentally transmitted pathogens.},

  abstract  = {To identify causation, model-free inference methods, such as Granger Causality, have been widely used due to their flexibility. However, they have difficulty distinguishing synchrony and indirect effects from direct causation, leading to false predictions. To overcome this, model-based inference methods that test the reproducibility of data with a specific mechanistic model to infer causality were developed. However, they can only be applied to systems described by a specific model, greatly limiting their applicability. Here, we address this limitation by deriving an easily testable condition for a general monotonic ODE model to reproduce time-series data. We built a user-friendly computational package, General ODE-Based Inference (GOBI), which is applicable to nearly any monotonic system with positive and negative regulations described by ODE. GOBI successfully inferred positive and negative regulations in various networks at both the molecular and population levels, unlike existing model-free methods. Thus, this accurate and broadly applicable inference method is a powerful tool for understanding complex dynamical systems. Traditional causal inference methods struggle to distinguish direct causation from synchrony and indirect effects. Here, authors present GOBI that overcomes this by testing a general model’s ability to reproduce data, providing accurate and broadly applicable causality inference for complex systems.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the safety of engineering systems is seriously threatened by increasingly complex and uncertain engineering environment, and the reliability analysis of engineering structure has attracted increasing attention. The sampling methods are widely used because of its simplicity and universality. However, their applications are limited by the expensive computational cost. To ease the computation burden, a new bubble sampling method (BSM) is proposed in this study. Its core idea is to generate several bubbles in the safe and failure domains, in which the performance function signs of samples located in these bubbles can be directly determined and are unnecessary to be computed. In this way, the number of function calls is greatly reduced. Moreover, a new bubble optimization model is developed, in which the uniform sampling strategy is adopted. Several numerical and engineering applications are validated to demonstrate the performances of the proposed BSM, which confirms its computational efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Ocean bottom pressure-gauge (OBP) records play an essential role in seafloor geodesy. Oceanographic fluctuations in OBP data, however, pose as a significant noise source in seafloor transient crustal deformation observations, including slow slip events (SSEs), making it crucial to evaluate them quantitatively. To extract the significant fluctuation phenomena common to multiple observation networks, including oceanographic fluctuations and tectonic signals, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the 3-year Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) OBP time series for 40 stations during 2016–2019. PCA could separate several oceanographic signals based on the characteristics of their spatial distributions, although evident transient tectonic signals could not be confirmed from the observed pressure records during this observed period. The spatial distribution of the first four principal components (PCs) reflected the common component, inclined component along sea depth, longitude component, and parabola-like pattern, respectively. By subtracting each PC (in particular, PC-2 and PC-4) from the time series, we could significantly reduce the sea depth dependence of OBP records, which has been highlighted in several previous studies and is also evident in this region. We interpreted PCs 2–4 as the reflection of the strength and meandering of ocean geostrophic currents based on a comparison with the PC spatial distribution of the numerical oceanographic models. In addition, to evaluate the ability of PCA to separate transient tectonic signal from OBP time series, including oceanographic fluctuations, we conducted a synthetic ramp assuming an SSE by rectangular fault and then applied PCA. The assumed synthetic tectonic signal could be separated from the oceanographic signals and included in the principal component independently depending on its amplitude, suggesting that the spatial distribution of each PC would change if the amplitude of the synthetic signal were sufficiently large. We propose a transient event-detection method based on the spatial distribution difference of a specific PC with or without a tectonic signal. We used the normalized inner product (NIP) between these PCs as the indicator of their similarities. This method can detect transient tectonic signals more significantly than the moment-magnitude scale of 5.9 from OBP records. Graphical Abstract },

A solution of such inverse problems estimates as a first step the activity emerging within functional networks from EEG or MEG data.

A second step estimating functional connectivity from such activity pseudodata unveil the oscillatory brain networks that strongly correlate with all cognition and behavior. Simulations of such MEG or EEG inverse problem also reveal estimation errors of the functional connectivity determined by any of the state-of-the-art inverse solutions. We disclose a significant cause of estimation errors originating from misspecification of the functional network model incorporated into either inverse solution steps. We introduce the Bayesian identification of a Hidden Gaussian Graphical Spectral (HIGGS) model specifying such oscillatory brain networks model.

  abstract  = {Atmospheric methane levels are growing rapidly, raising concerns that sustained methane growth could constitute a challenge for limiting global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, even under stringent CO_2 mitigation. Here we use an Earth system model to investigate the importance of immediate versus delayed methane mitigation to comply with the 2 °C limit under a future scenario of low CO_2 emissions. Our results suggest that methane mitigation initiated before 2030, alongside stringent CO_2 mitigation, could enable to limit global warming to well below 2 °C over the next three centuries. However, delaying methane mitigation to 2040 or beyond increases the risk of breaching the 2 °C limit, with every 10-year delay resulting in an additional peak warming of  0.1 °C. The peak warming is amplified by the carbon-climate feedback whose strength increases with delayed methane mitigation. We conclude that urgent methane mitigation is needed to increase the likelihood of achieving the 2 °C goal. The difference between initiating mitigation of methane emissions before 2030 and delaying this to after 2040 could mean success or failure in meeting the 2 °C warming target, according to climate modelling that accounts for potential changes in methane emissions and carbon-cycle feedbacks.},

  abstract  = {We study the cosmological dynamics of dark energy in a scalar-vector-torsion theory. The vector field is described by the cosmic triad and the scalar field is of the quintessence type with non-minimal coupling to gravity. The coupling to gravity is introduced through the interaction between the scalar field and torsion, where torsion is defined in the context of teleparallel gravity. We derive the full set of field equations for the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker space-time background and obtain the associated autonomous system. We obtain the critical points and their stability conditions, along with the cosmological properties of them. Thus, we show that the thermal history of the universe is successfully reproduced. Furthermore, new scaling solutions in which the scalar and vector field densities scale in the same way as the radiation and matter background fluids have been found. Finally, we also show that there exist new attractor fixed points whose nature is mainly vectorial, and which can explain the current accelerated expansion and therefore the dark energy-domination.},

  abstract  = {Integrated Information Theory was developed to explain and quantify consciousness, arguing that conscious systems consist of elements that are integrated through their causal properties. This study presents an implementation of Integrated Information Theory 3.0, the latest version of this framework, to functional MRI data. Data were acquired from 17 healthy subjects who underwent sedation with propofol, a short-acting anaesthetic. Using the PyPhi software package, we systematically analyze how Φ^max, a measure of integrated information, is modulated by the sedative in different resting-state networks. We compare Φ^max to other proposed measures of conscious level, including the previous version of integrated information, Granger causality, and correlation-based functional connectivity. Our results indicate that Φ^max presents a variety of sedative-induced behaviours for different networks. Notably, changes to Φ^max closely reflect changes to subjects’ conscious level in the frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks, which are responsible for higher-order cognitive functions. In conclusion, our findings present important insight into different measures of conscious level that will be useful in future implementations to functional MRI and other forms of neuroimaging. Resting-state fMRI data in conditions of wakefulness and anaesthesia was analyzed using integrated information theory and its key measure, Φmax, which presents a variety of sedative-induced behaviours across different cortical networks.},

  abstract  = {Simultaneous harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a threat to global food security. Concurrent weather extremes driven by a strongly meandering jet stream could trigger such events, but so far this has not been quantified. Specifically, the ability of state-of-the art crop and climate models to adequately reproduce such high impact events is a crucial component for estimating risks to global food security. Here we find an increased likelihood of concurrent low yields during summers featuring meandering jets in observations and models. While climate models accurately simulate atmospheric patterns, associated surface weather anomalies and negative effects on crop responses are mostly underestimated in bias-adjusted simulations. Given the identified model biases, future assessments of regional and concurrent crop losses from meandering jet states remain highly uncertain. Our results suggest that model-blind spots for such high-impact but deeply-uncertain hazards have to be anticipated and accounted for in meaningful climate risk assessments. Simultaneous harvest failures across crop-producing regions are major threats to global food security. A strongly meandering jet can trigger these, however, climate and crop models underestimate effects with consequences for climate risk assessments.},

In this paper, a novel unified reliability evaluation framework is proposed: to meet the high-efficacy computing demand of multi-site reliability evaluation, a new optimized Kriging surrogate-based improved importance sampling (OKS-IIS) method is first presented; furthermore, to quantify the failure correlation relationships among multiple dangerous sites, a novel failure correlation analysis (FCA) strategy is further developed. A typical reliability evaluation of high-pressure turbine rotor with multiple dangerous sites is selected, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Methods comparison show that the OKS-IIS method can improve computing efficiency while keeping computing accuracy, and the FCA strategy can accurately quantify the multi-site failure correlation. The current efforts would shed a light on the complex reliability evaluation problems involving failure correlation.},

  abstract  = {Traditionally, testing is done first at end of the design phase; however, this is no longer the case. Testing, finding, and categorising bugs, as well as releasing the development changes into the product, carry a price tag. If the test/verification team discovers a high-severity issue at the end of the lifecycle, the costs may climb. Even if all of the issues are resolved, the release could be delayed. Shift left testing is done in isolation by the test/verification team and does not increase testing time, but it has demonstrated to be in sync with product development in some cases. In the context of a process, shifting left refers to taking action early on. Shift left testing refers to the practise of testing software earlier in the development cycle than is customary, or to the left in the delivery pipeline, as opposed to the traditional practise of testing software later in the development cycle. Shifting to a "shift left" strategy assumes that the software development team may find bugs faster if they test their code as it is being written, rather than waiting until the end of the project based on fuzzy. Before the code is available for testing, shift left testing encourages developers to write test cases. An agile software development strategy known as "shift left" stresses putting test cases in place early in the life cycle of a project rather than at the conclusion. It also means that automated tests will cover a larger portion of a project's planned functionality rather to just a small portion. The shift left testing adoption benefits the organisation to reduce the development cost and time as the testing is done along with development to avoid delay in the process. This paper analyses the benefits of organisations who adopted shift left testing in the software development process.},

In the recent past, lots of sketch-to-photograph retrieval methods are proposed by many researchers; however, they have ignored the uncertainty of facial attributes for suspect face retrieval. Recently, linguistic information is also utilized for suspect face retrieval. In this paper, we have provided an extensive review of the available methods for suspect face retrieval using visual and linguistic information. The review focuses firstly on the traditional methods and their categorization also shows the evolution of suspect face retrieval approaches over the years.

  abstract  = {In order to meet the increasingly stringent emission standards, a wide variety of lightweight materials are accounting for an increasing proportion in the white-body of vehicle. Many new joining technologies have been developed to connect these lightweight materials. Mechanical clinching is an effective alternative technique to join similar and dissimilar lightweight materials, which has been widely used in automotive industry. Understanding the fatigue properties of clinched joints is extremely significant as fatigue is the dominant failure mode in engineering practice. This paper provides a systematic review on the research progress of fatigue behaviour of clinched joints, including fatigue strength, failure mechanism, influencing factors, and life estimation model. It has been found that clinched joints performed superior fatigue resistance than traditional welding joints, and the failure modes were divided into neck fracture, bottom pull-out, upper sheet fracture, and lower sheet fracture. The recent development of fatigue life estimation model is described with brief case study from the literature. In short, the main purpose of the present article is to figure out the development roadmap of fatigue behaviour investigation of clinched joints and provide some suggestions for further study.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies applied a large variety of performance metrics to evaluate the global and regional climate model simulations; however, there is still a huge debate to justify the rationale for the chosen metrics. The performance of sixty Euro-CORDEX temperature and precipitation simulations was investigated in temporal and spatial approaches through various common metrics over Türkiye. In addition, several mutual information (MI) methods based on the information theory were evaluated as state-of-the-art alternative metrics and compared with the applied common metrics. Based on the average of outputs over the ensemble of the driving models for the annual temperature, the MBE, MASE, MRAE, and NSE are presenting a similar pattern on the rank of the simulations. The MPI with 0.3 on MBE, NCC with 2.7, 2.9, and − 10.4 on MASE, MRAE, and NSE, respectively, and IPSL-LR and NOAA with 0.1 on the modified KGE represented the least errors. The ICHEC with respective 15, 0.1, 1.01, and − 4 for the MBE, MASE, MRAE, and NSE presented the lowest errors for the similar above-mentioned analysis except for the precipitation. The MPI and CNRM with 0.37, 0.37, and 0.08 obtained the highest outcomes on the KNN, mixed and noisy KNN, respectively. We conclude that the ability of mutual information to capture nonlinear relationships is very beneficial. Finally, it is also suggested to undertake these analyses for other hydroclimatic variables for future studies to gain a comprehensive insight into the performance of MI methods.},

And energy revolution is the key to achieve this goal. More and more energy enterprises seek to promote the “double carbon” goal through the digital platformization. However, the mechanism of digital platformization promoting the realization of “double carbon” goal is still unclear. Based on the perspective of platform ecosystem and organization structure, this paper deeply analyzes the key intermediary role of energy production mode change and energy trading mode change in energy transformation. This paper also studies the regulatory effect of policy environment, digital platform characteristics, platform leverage, value chain changes, and the ability of digital technology practice and innovatively puts forward the theoretical model. This model reveals the transmission path and internal mechanism of digital platformization of energy companies to promote the realization of dual-carbon goal. Through the established model, this paper analyzes a case that present the commercial digital platformization process developed by Chinese energy company. Such an innovative process in China context has been developed in order to contribute to achieve “double carbon” goals for the future.},

  abstract  = {The present study was conducted to understand the key ecological and biological questions of conservation importance in Drepanostachyum falcatum which aimed to map potential distribution in the western Himalayas and decipher spatial genetic structure. Eco-distribution maps were generated through ecological niche modelling using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm implemented with 228 geocoordinates of species presence and 12 bioclimatic variables. Concomitantly, 26 natural populations in the western Himalayas were genetically analysed using ten genomic sequence-tagged microsatellite (STMS) markers. Model-derived distribution was adequately supported with appropriate statistical measures, such as area under the ‘receiver operating characteristics (ROC)’ curve (AUC; 0.917 ± 0.034)”, Kappa (K; 0.418), normalized mutual information (NMI; 0.673) and true skill statistic (TSS; 0.715). Further, Jackknife test and response curves showed that the precipitation (pre- and post-monsoon) and temperature (average throughout the year and pre-monsoon) maximize the probabilistic distribution of D. falcatum . We recorded a wide and abundant (4096.86 km^2) distribution of D. falcatum in the western Himalayas with maximum occurrence at 1500 to 2500 m asl. Furthermore, marker analysis exemplified high gene diversity with low genetic differentiation in D. falcatum . Relatively, the populations of Uttarakhand are more genetically diverse than Himachal Pradesh, whereas within the Uttarakhand, the Garhwal region captured a higher allelic diversity than Kumaon. Clustering and structure analysis indicated two major gene pools, where genetic admixing appeared to be controlled by long-distance gene flow, horizontal geographical distance, aspect, and precipitation. Both the species distribution map and population genetic structure derived herein may serve as valuable resources for conservation and management of Himalayan hill bamboos.},

In this case study, we present an assistance system for object-specific repair tasks for turbine blades. The assistance system provides digital work instructions and uses augmented reality to display spatial information. In a user study with ten experienced metalworkers performing a familiar repair task, we compare time to task completion, subjective workload, and system usability of the new assistance system to their established paper-based workflow.

Starting with a historical survey, we then focus on a set of “tension points” that are still left unresolved despite the remarkable progress of the past century. In our discussion of these tension points we touch upon the physical well-posedness of mean-field electrodynamics; constraints imposed by magnetic helicity conservation; the troublesome role of differential rotation; meridional flows and flux transpost dynamos; competing inductive mechanisms and Babcock–Leighton dynamos; the ambiguous precursor properties of the solar dipole; cycle amplitude regulation and fluctuation through nonlinear backreaction and stochastic forcing, including Grand Minima; and the promises and puzzles offered by global magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulations of convection and dynamo action. We close by considering the potential bridges to be constructed between solar dynamo theory and modelling, and observations of magnetic activity in late-type stars.},

  abstract  = {One obvious feature of the solar cycle is its variation from one cycle to another. In this article, we review the dynamo models for the long-term variations of the solar cycle. By long-term variations, we mean the cycle modulations beyond the 11-year periodicity and these include, the Gnevyshev–Ohl/Even–Odd rule, grand minima, grand maxima, Gleissberg cycle, and Suess cycles. After a brief review of the observed data, we present the dynamo models for the solar cycle. By carefully analyzing the dynamo models and the observed data, we identify the following broad causes for the modulation: (1) magnetic feedback on the flow, (2) stochastic forcing, and (3) time delays in various processes of the dynamo. To demonstrate each of these causes, we present the results from some illustrative models for the cycle modulations and discuss their strengths and weakness. We also discuss a few critical issues and their current trends. The article ends with a discussion of our current state of ignorance about comparing detailed features of the magnetic cycle and the large-scale velocity from the dynamo models with robust observations.},

  abstract  = {Aftershocks are a fundamental characteristic of seismicity, and their generation mechanism is mainly characterized by two physical models, stress transfer from large earthquakes and afterslip-induced stress loading. However, the contribution of each mechanism to aftershock generation remains unclear. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal variations in aftershock activity following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake by applying the Hierarchical Space–Time Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (HIST-ETAS) model to the decade of recorded seismicity since the mainshock. Using the estimated HIST-ETAS model, we categorize the aftershocks into background earthquakes (which are caused by aseismic phenomena) and triggered earthquakes (which are caused by earthquake-to-earthquake interactions). Most of the earthquakes that occurred updip of the large coseismic slip zone along the Japan Trench are triggered earthquakes, consistent with the lack of afterslip in this area. Conversely, background earthquakes are the predominant earthquake type in the long-term downdip of the large coseismic slip zone, and they positively correlate with the afterslip evolution. Our results suggest the importance of combining these two end-member aftershock generation models to explain aftershock activity and thus provide new insights into the relationship between afterslip and spatiotemporal aftershock distribution. Our classifications may also contribute to the monitoring of afterslip in a given region that hosts a large earthquake, particularly where geodetic observation networks are too sparse to evaluate afterslip evolution.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary approach to automatically generate finite state machines (FSMs) based on bug reports written in natural language, to automatically capture incorrect software behaviour. These FSMs can then be used by testers to both exercise the reported bugs and create tests that can potentially reveal new bugs. The FSM generation is guided by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) that simultaneously minimises three objectives: size of the models, number of unrealistic states (over-generalisation), and number of states not covered by the models (under-generalisation). We assess the feasibility of our approach for 10 real-world software programs by exploiting three different MOEAs (NSGA-II, NSGA-III and MOEA/D) and benchmarking them with the baseline tool KLFA. Our results show that KLFA is not practical to be used with real-world software, because it generates models that over generalise software behaviour. Among the three MOEAs, NSGA-II obtained significantly better results than the other two for all 10 programs, detecting a greater number of bugs for 90},

  abstract  = {Epidemic diseases and media campaigns are closely associated with each other. Considering most epidemics have multiple pathogenic strains, in this paper, we take the lead in proposing two multi-strain SIS epidemic models in heterogeneous networks incorporating awareness programs due to media. For the first model, we assume that the transmission rates for strain 1 and strain 2 depend on the level of awareness campaigns. For the second one, we further suppose that awareness divides susceptible population into two different subclasses. After defining the basic reproductive numbers for the whole model and each strain, we obtain the analytical conditions that determine the extinction, coexistence and absolute dominance of two strains. Moreover, we also formulate its optimal control problem and identify an optimal implementation pair of awareness campaigns using optimal control theory. Given the complexity of the second model, we use the numerical simulations to visualize its different types of dynamical behaviors. Through theoretical and numerical analysis of these two models, we discover some new phenomena. For example, during the persistence analysis of the first model, we find that the characteristic polynomials of two boundary equilibria may have a pair of pure imaginary roots, implying that Hopf bifurcation and periodic solutions may appear. Most strikingly, multistability occurs in the second model and the growth rate of awareness programs (triggered by the infection prevalence) has a multistage impact on the final size of two strains. The numerical results suggest that the spread of a two-strain epidemic can be controlled (even be eradicated) by taking the measures of enhancing awareness transmission, reducing memory fading of aware individuals and ensuring high-level influx and rapid growth of awareness programs appropriately.},

Compound dry-hot extreme (CDHE) events pose greater risks to the environment, society, and human health than their univariate counterparts. Here, we project decadal-length changes in the frequency and duration of CDHE events for major U.S. cities during the 21st century. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to an urban canopy parameterization, we find a considerable increase in the frequency and duration of future CDHE events across all U.S. major cities under the compound effect of high-intensity GHG- and urban development-induced warming. Our results indicate that while GHG-induced warming is the primary driver of the increased frequency and duration of CDHE events, urban development amplifies this effect and should not be neglected. Furthermore, We show that the highest frequency amplification of major CDHE events is expected for U.S. cities across the Great Plains South, Southwest, and the southern part of the Northwest National Climate Assessment regions.},

  abstract  = {Acetate is traditionally viewed as a toxic by‐product of glycolytic metabolism that inhibits microbial growth. This study demonstrates that acetate can act as a co‐substrate of glycolytic nutrients and promotes Escherichia coli growth when the glycolytic flux is low. Glycolytic flux determines the role of acetate as a by‐product or co‐substrate of glycolytic nutrients. Acetate utilization by the Pta‐AckA pathway is enhanced at reduced glycolytic flux. Acetate promotes bacterial growth at low glycolytic flux. Acetate increases the robustness of E. coli responses to glycolytic perturbations by buffering carbon uptake. Systems biology analysis highlights an unexpected role for acetate as a compensatory carbon source under conditions of reduced glycolysis. Acetate, a major by‐product of glycolytic metabolism in Escherichia coli and many other microorganisms, has long been considered a toxic waste compound that inhibits microbial growth. This counterproductive auto‐inhibition represents a major problem in biotechnology and has puzzled the scientific community for decades. Recent studies have however revealed that acetate is also a co‐substrate of glycolytic nutrients and a global regulator of E. coli metabolism and physiology. Here, we used a systems biology strategy to investigate the mutual regulation of glycolytic and acetate metabolism in E. coli . Computational and experimental analyses demonstrate that decreasing the glycolytic flux enhances co‐utilization of acetate with glucose. Acetate metabolism thus compensates for the reduction in glycolytic flux and eventually buffers carbon uptake so that acetate, rather than being toxic, actually enhances E. coli growth under these conditions. We validated this mechanism using three orthogonal strategies: chemical inhibition of glucose uptake, glycolytic mutant strains, and alternative substrates with a natively low glycolytic flux. In summary, acetate makes E. coli more robust to glycolytic perturbations and is a valuable nutrient, with a beneficial effect on microbial growth.},

  abstract  = {Low-code software development promises rapid delivery of software cloud applications by employing domain-specific languages (DSLs), requiring minimal traditional coding. Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides tools, modelling notations and practices suited for engineering such DSLs, both from a syntactic and semantic perspective. However, low-code software development is heavily reliant on software reuse. It is imperative to provide safe mechanisms that guarantee valid semantic reuse of structural components and their behaviour, most often in a stepwise manner. This article presents a semantic reuse technique based on model subtyping over metamodels to manage correct model-driven engineering of DSLs. Model subtyping is generalized to structural semantics by considering OCL constraints. Moreover, model subtyping is generalized to behavioural semantics by considering specifications of model transformation operations, which may encode operational or translational semantics. Model subtyping facilitates structural and behavioural refinement. It has been implemented atop a bounded model checker, realizing a semi-decidable procedure for verifying that DSL elements are safely reused. The algorithm finds semantic witnesses of inconsistencies when refinement principles are not satisfied, fostering a correct stepwise engineering of DSLs. Moreover, the algorithm produces an extension metamodel that permits the as-is reuse of implementations of model transformation operation specifications. Finally, the versatility of the model subtyping technique is illustrated with common use cases extracted from the research literature.},

Besides the OCCI Core model, which defines the basic modeling elements for cloud resources, further standardized extensions exist that reflect the requirements of different cloud service levels, such as infrastructure and platform elements. However, so far the OCCI platform extension is very coarse-grained and lacks supporting use cases and implementations. Especially, it does not define how the components of the application itself can be managed.

  abstract  = {The problem of maximizing the throughput of Semiconductor Wafer Fabrication Systems is addressed. We model the fabrication systems as a Stochastic Timed Automata and design a discrete-event simulation scheme. The simulation scheme is explicit, fast and achieves high fidelity which captures the feature of reentrant process flow and is flexible to accommodate diversified wafer lot scheduling policies. A series of Marginal Machine Allocation Algorithms are proposed to sequentially allocate machines. Numerical experiments suggest the designed methods are efficient to find good allocation solutions.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new method for estimating how much decisions under monadic uncertainty matter. The method is generic and suitable for measuring responsibility in finite horizon sequential decision processes. It fulfills “fairness” requirements and three natural conditions for responsibility measures: agency, avoidance and causal relevance. We apply the method to study how much decisions matter in a stylized greenhouse gas emissions process in which a decision maker repeatedly faces two options: start a “green” transition to a decarbonized society or further delay such a transition. We account for the fact that climate decisions are rarely implemented with certainty and that their consequences on the climate and on the global economy are uncertain. We discover that a “moral” approach towards decision making — doing the right thing even though the probability of success becomes increasingly small — is rational over a wide range of uncertainties.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of minimizing a composite convex function with two different access methods: an oracle , for which we can evaluate the value and gradient, and a structured function , which we access only by solving a convex optimization problem. We are motivated by two associated technological developments. For the oracle, systems like PyTorch or TensorFlow can automatically and efficiently compute gradients, given a computation graph description. For the structured function, systems like CVXPY accept a high level domain specific language description of the problem, and automatically translate it to a standard form for efficient solution. We develop a method that makes minimal assumptions about the two functions, does not require the tuning of algorithm parameters, and works well in practice across a variety of problems. Our algorithm combines a number of well-known ideas, including a low-rank quasi-Newton approximation of curvature, piecewise affine lower bounds from bundle-type methods, and two types of damping to ensure stability. We illustrate the method on stochastic optimization, utility maximization, and risk-averse programming problems, showing that our method is more efficient than standard solvers when the oracle function contains much data.},

  abstract  = {We present a study on validation of the National Institute for Environmental Studies Transport Model (NIES TM) by comparing to observed vertical profiles of atmospheric CO_2. The model uses a hybrid sigma-isentropic ( σ − θ ) vertical coordinate that employs both terrain-following and isentropic parts switched smoothly in the stratosphere. The model transport is driven by reanalyzed meteorological fields and designed to simulate seasonal and diurnal cycles, synoptic variations, and spatial distributions of atmospheric chemical constituents in the troposphere. The model simulations were run for combination of biosphere, fossil fuel, air-ocean exchange, biomass burning and inverse correction fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO_2) by GOSAT Level 4 product. We compared the NIES TM simulated fluxes with data from the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) Merged 10-s Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Aerosol Data, including HIPPO-1, HIPPO-2 and HIPPO-3 from 128.0°E to 84.0°W, and 87.0°N to 67.2°S. The simulation results were compared with CO_2 observations made in January and November, 2009, and March and April, 2010. The analysis attests that the model is sufficient to simulate vertical profiles with errors within 1–2 ppmv, except for the lower stratosphere in the northern hemisphere high latitudes.},

We video recorded staff movements during a set of surgical procedures. Then we divided the OR into multiple zones and analyzed the frequency and duration of movement from origin to destination through zones. This data was abstracted into a generalized, agent-based, discrete event simulation model to study how OR size and OR equipment layout affected surgical staff movement and total number of surgical team contacts during a procedure. A full factorial experiment with seven input factors – OR size, OR shape, operating table orientation, circulating nurse (CN) workstation location, team size, number of doors, and procedure type – was conducted. Results were analyzed using multiple linear regression with surgical team contacts as the dependent variable. The OR size, the CN workstation location, and team size significantly affected surgical team contacts. Also, two- and three-way interactions between staff, procedure type, table orientation, and CN workstation location significantly affected contacts. We discuss implications of these findings for OR managers and for future research about designing future ORs.},

The evacuation tests are organized in accordance with different core components related to evacuation modelling, namely Population, Pre-evacuation, Movement, Route/destination selection, Flow constraints, Events, Wildfire spread and Trigger buffers. A reporting template has also been developed to facilitate the application of the verification testing protocol. An example application of the testing protocol has been performed using an open wildfire evacuation modelling platform called WUI-NITY and its associated trigger buffer model k-PERIL. The verification testing protocol is deemed to improve the credibility of wildfire evacuation model results and stimulate future modelling efforts in this domain.},

  abstract  = {Rivers originating in the Tibetan Plateau are crucial to the population in Asia. However, research about quantifying seasonal catchment memory of these rivers is still limited. Here, we propose a model able to accurately estimate terrestrial water storage change (TWSC), and characterize catchment memory processes and durations using the memory curve and the influence/domination time, respectively. By investigating eight representative basins of the region, we find that the seasonal catchment memory in precipitation-dominated basins is mainly controlled by precipitation, and that in non-precipitation-dominated basins is strongly influenced by temperature. We further uncover that in precipitation-dominated basins, longer influence time corresponds to longer domination time, with the influence/domination time of approximately six/four months during monsoon season. In addition, the long-term catchment memory is observed in non-precipitation-dominated basins. Quantifying catchment memory can identify efficient lead times for seasonal streamflow forecasts and water resource management. This study investigates the seasonal catchment memory of rivers in the Tibetan Plateau, with the help of a water storage change model. Understanding catchment memory can aid in hydrological forecasts and water resource management},

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was employed to design a research model, and a mixed-mode methodology was employed. Quantitative data from survey questionnaires was used to gather data from practitioners in enterprises within Norway and Ireland that currently adopt Enterprise Architecture (EA) in a smart city project to empirically validate the developed EAF. Additionally, the developed EAF layers were validated through a qualitative focus group workshop with participants that utilize the developed EAF to provide digital services in smart cities. The findings suggest that the developed EAF can aid enterprises that provided digital services in identifying and assessing their digitalization initiatives and how EA benefits can be realized. Drawing on the TAM, the developed research model presents factors that influence practitioner’s adoption of EA towards the digitalization of urban environments. More importantly, this study provides empirically validated research on EAF adoption which is scarce.},

  abstract  = {This study aimed to investigates the precipitation and temperature trends over ten districts of Jimma zone in the twenty-first century using observed and model simulation data sets. The precipitation and temperature trends are analyzed for the reference (1981–2010) and two future periods, namely, mid-century (2031–2060), and end-century (2071–2100) using Innovative Trend Analysis. For future period, we analyzed the ensemble mean of precipitation and temperature based on data from four high resolution models, namely, High-Resolution Hamburg Climate Model 5, Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO22T), Climate Limited-Area Modeling Community (CCLM4), and the Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric Model (RCA4). Based on the analysis, the annual, summer and autumn rainfall trend during the reference period are − 4.079 mm/year, 2.147 mm/year, and − 1.639 mm/year, respectively. The winter rainfall reveals a negative trend (− 0.135 mm/year) during the reference period. However, the winter rainfall shows a positive trend (0.465 mm/year and 0.067 mm/year) towards the end-century period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. On the contrary, the autumn rainfall showed consistent decreasing trend during the two future periods. The maximum increasing trend (1.376 mm/year) in annual rainfall was obtained during the mid-century period under RCP4.5 scenario, whereas the maximum annual decreasing rainfall trend was obtained during the mid-century period under RCP8.5 scenario (− 0.649 mm/year). The minimum temperature showed significant increasing trend throughout the study periods. However, the maximum temperature showed decreasing trend during annual and winter in the mid-century period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The highest increasing trend of the minimum temperature was during winter and autumn, while the highest increasing trend of the maximum temperature was during the summer and autumn seasons. The result further indicate that the minimum temperature increment was faster as compared to the maximum temperature. The study can be used as a first-hand information to develop efficient adaptation policies and mitigation measures that aids to combat the adverse impact of climate change.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on identifying the convection heat transfer coefficients of the friction stir welding (FSW) temperature field from the temperature measuring data. Firstly, the numerical model of the FSW temperature field is constructed by utilizing the Lagrangian formulation. Then a novel inversion method combined with the surrogate model is proposed. The surrogate model based on proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis function (RBF) is applied to approximate the input-output relationship of the numerical model. To improve the calculation efficiency and accuracy of the inversion method, an iterative updating method of the surrogate model combined with parallel computing technology is adopted. Subsequently, the effect of the type of RBF and the measurement position of the thermocouple on the calculation accuracy of the inversion analysis method are analyzed. The conclusions indicate that all the RBFs used in this paper are suitable for constructing the surrogate model of the temperature field. With the thermocouple measuring point close to the weld center, the maximum RMSE calculated by the numerical model decreases from 10.8 °C to 7.0 °C, but the maximum relative error of the peak temperature changes slightly, about 7.5},

This oscillation has an amplitude of   6 Sv and a period of   150 years and significantly impacts the atmosphere. We find that it is a self-sustained low-frequency internal variability, driven by the accumulation of salinity anomalies in the Arctic and their release into the North Atlantic, affecting the water column stability and the deep convection. Sea ice plays a major role in creating the salinity anomaly in the Arctic, while the anomalous Arctic oceanic circulation, which drives the exchange of liquid freshwater between the Arctic and the open ocean, is the main responsible for its southward propagation. Interestingly, EC-Earth3 simulations with increased greenhouse concentrations, and therefore under a warmer climate, do not exhibit these strong AMOC fluctuations. We hypothesize that in a quasi-equilibrium climate with a global air surface temperature 4.5° higher than the pre-industrial period, the low amount of sea ice in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic is no longer able to trigger the mechanism.},

  abstract  = {The accurate prediction of the stability of open-pit mine slopes is usually one of the difficult problems faced by mining engineers and researchers, which is caused by the indeterminacy and uncertainty contained in the influence factors of stability of open-pit mine slopes. The single-valued neutrosophic number (SVNN) is very suitable for representing the information of truth, falsity, and indeterminacy in inconsistent and indeterminate situations. This paper proposes a method combining SVNN with Gaussian process regression (SVNN-GPR) to evaluate the open-pit mine slopes stability in uncertain environment. At first, the proposed method expresses the uncertain influence factors/indices (dip of potential failure plane, cohesion, friction angle, etc.) and the stability state of open-pit mine slopes as SVNNs. Then, the SVNN-GPR is established to obtain the latent complicated relationship between SVNN influence factors and slope stability. Finally, we use the score values of the SVNN output of the proposed method to predict the stability of each slope. To test the performance of the proposed method, we collected 286 slope cases from Zhejiang Province, China. The practical application results reflect that the SVNN-GPR method based on the exponential covariance function and isotropic distance measure has best training and testing results, and the training accuracy reaches 98.0},

  abstract  = {Malfunctioning of islanding detection algorithms leads to system instability, failure of reclosing, and damage to load-side equipment. It also threatens security personnel. Therefore, islanding detection is an essential task for the proper functioning of the distribution system. In this paper, an islanding detection technique is presented for a grid-connected distributed power generation system. The proposed islanding detection technique is based on the change in superimposed positive sequence apparent power (CSPSAP). The CSPSAP-based islanding detection technique discriminates islanding and non-islanding events. The accessibility of positive sequence components makes the technique suitable for islanding detection for a wide range of active and reactive power mismatches. It works effectively in zero power mismatch conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified for islanding events in cases of distributed generation disconnection with the inclusion of noise, various irradiances, and unbalanced load. Even the proposed technique proves its efficacy under various non-islanding events such as capacitor switching, different fault cases, and load switching. The impact of the proposed technique is also validated in cases of islanding and non-islanding under weak grid systems. The proposed islanding detection technique is fast due to the utilization of local measured parameters at the point of common coupling and does not have power quality degradation issues. Effects of the false detection zone and non-detection zone are also discussed with regard to the proposed technique. The proposed technique is also validated on the real-time platform of the OPAL-RT. MATLAB 2018a software is considered to model and simulate a microgrid.},

  abstract  = {Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) are widely used, with about 1.8 billion users worldwide in 2020. For designing and building CUI, dialogue designers have to decide on how the CUI communicates with users and what dialogue strategies to pursue (e.g. reactive vs. proactive). Dialogue strategies can be evaluated in user tests by comparing user perceptions and reactions to different dialogue strategies. Simulating CUI and running them online, for example on crowdsourcing websites, is an attractive avenue to collecting user perceptions and reactions, as they can be gathered time- and cost-effectively. However, developing and deploying a CUI on a crowd sourcing platform can be laborious and requires technical proficiency from researchers. We present Chatbot Language (CBL) as a framework to quickly develop and deploy CUI on crowd sourcing platforms, without requiring a technical background. CBL is a library with specialized CUI functionality, which is based on the high-level language JavaScript. In addition, CBL provides scripts that use the API of the crowd sourcing platform Mechanical Turk (MT) in order to (a) create MT Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) and (b) retrieve the results of those HITs. We used CBL to run experiments on MT and present a sample workflow as well as an example experiment. CBL is freely available and we discuss how CBL can be used now and may be further developed in the future.},

  abstract  = {Abstract A mathematical model is constructed for the evolution of spherical perturbations in a cosmological one-component statistical system of completely degenerate scalar-charged fermions with a scalar Higgs coupling. A complete system of self-consistent equations for the evolution of small spherical perturbations is constructed. Singular parts in perturbation modes corresponding to a point-like mass and scalar charge are singled out. We obtain systems of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the mass and charge of a singular source and systems of partial differential equations for the evolution of nonsingular parts of perturbations. The coefficients of partial differential equations are described by solutions of evolutionary equations for mass and charge. The problem of spatially localized perturbations for solutions that are polynomial in the radial coordinate is reduced to a recurrent system of ordinary linear differential equations for the coefficients of these polynomials. The properties of solutions are studied in the case of cubic polynomials; in particular, it is shown that the radii of localization of gravitational and scalar perturbations coincide and evolve in proportion to the scale factor. The evolution of perturbations is modeled numerically, which in particular confirms the exponential growth of the central mass of the perturbation, and also reveals the oscillatory nature of the evolution of the scalar charge.},

This is true particularly for programs such as GPU applications and compiler tuning, both of which have discrete and often nonlinear interactions between parameters and performance. After assessing a few alternative algorithmic configurations, we present two hybrid derivative-free optimization (DFO) approaches to maximize the performance of an algorithm. We demonstrate how we use our method to solve problems with up to 50 hyperparameters.

The evolution of cross-border trade flows and dependency relationships, as well as trade organization patterns of manufactured products, equipment and materials for manufacturing, are investigated by constructing a global semiconductor trade relationship matrix and using the Gini coefficient and trade dependency index. It was found that: (1) the global semiconductor trade is highly spatially unbalanced, with materials and equipment trade in particular highly concentrated in a few countries on both the supply and demand sides; (2) China has replaced the US as the largest global semiconductor trade player and has shaped the regionalized system of manufactured goods and materials trade with East and Southeast Asian economies, but its equipment trade is highly dependent on Europe and the US; (3) the semiconductor production model has promoted the regionalization of the east and southeast Asia region in the trade of manufactured products and materials, and developed economies such as the US, the EU, Japan, and South Korea have maintained their monopolistic advantage in the trade of semiconductor equipment by building exclusive innovation networks and establishing trade barriers. The monopolistic nature of the semiconductor equipment trade and the regionalization of manufactured goods and materials have formed the characteristics of the global semiconductor trade and are likely to be further strengthened in future trade.},

  abstract  = {Although agile software development (ASD) has been adopted in the industry, requirements approaches for ASD still neglect non-functional requirements. Privacy has become a concern due to new user demands and data protection laws. Hence, privacy needs to be properly specified, but agile requirements engineering techniques do not explicitly represent privacy requirements and, therefore, are not able to proper analyze such requirements. In this context, Privacy Criteria Method (PCM), an approach to specify privacy in requirements activities, was proposed to produce more complete and detailed privacy requirements. By considering PCM a promising approach to be used in ASD and the importance of empirical evaluation of new methods, we have as objectives: 1 evaluate the ability of PCM to support systems analysts in specifying privacy requirements when used in conjunction with some agile specification methods; and 2 show our lessons learned in conducting empirical research based on an mix-method approach defined to empirically evaluate the suitability of a requirements specification in specifying privacy requirements. Mixed-method approach is a controlled experiment as a quantitative evaluation and a feasibility study (questionnaire and task analysis based) study as a qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The requirements specifications following PCM allow to represent privacy aspects, such as user’s personal data and the privacy mechanism that can be used to mitigate a privacy risk scenario. We also observed that some extra time is necessary to specify privacy requirements with PCM, but it does not imply a greater perceived effort. Specifications produced with PCM are of good quality and more privacy detailed. Additionally, we attest to the importance of conducting empirical research to evaluate new methods. PCM assists in specifying more complete and detailed in relation to traditional techniques used in ASD, which facilitates communication between the requirements analysts and developers.},

  abstract  = {For uncertain structures with the coexisting random and interval inputs, effectively estimating the lower and upper bounds of failure probability is always a challenge. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two-stage adaptive radial-based importance sampling (TARBIS) method, where two optimal spheres are sought successively in two stages to estimate the bounds of failure probability. Then, by replacing the true limit state function using the Kriging model, a Kriging-assisted TARBIS (K-TARBIS) is further developed to improve the computational efficiency. In the first stage, the training points mostly contributing to the estimation of two bounds of failure probability are identified by a system reliability theory-based U ( SYSU ) learning function to update the Kriging model. In the second stage, the Kriging model is updated only on sample points contributing to the estimation of the upper bound of failure probability. Throughout the active learning process, the Kriging model is sequentially updated in a series of small sub-candidate sample pools of TARBIS, which greatly reduces the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through four representative examples.},

  abstract  = {Most biomedical knowledge is published as text, making it challenging to analyse using traditional statistical methods. In contrast, machine-interpretable data primarily comes from structured property databases, which represent only a fraction of the knowledge present in the biomedical literature. Crucial insights and inferences can be drawn from these publications by the scientific community. We trained language models on literature from different time periods to evaluate their ranking of prospective gene-disease associations and protein–protein interactions. Using 28 distinct historical text corpora of abstracts published between 1995 and 2022, we trained independent Word2Vec models to prioritise associations that were likely to be reported in future years. This study demonstrates that biomedical knowledge can be encoded as word embeddings without the need for human labelling or supervision. Language models effectively capture drug discovery concepts such as clinical tractability, disease associations, and biochemical pathways. Additionally, these models can prioritise hypotheses years before their initial reporting. Our findings underscore the potential for extracting yet-to-be-discovered relationships through data-driven approaches, leading to generalised biomedical literature mining for potential therapeutic drug targets. The Publication-Wide Association Study (PWAS) enables the prioritisation of under-explored targets and provides a scalable system for accelerating early-stage target ranking, irrespective of the specific disease of interest.},

  abstract  = {A maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) reduces the drug-sensitive cell population, though it may result in the competitive release of drug resistance. Alternative treatment strategies such as adaptive therapy (AT) or dose modulation aim to impose competitive stress on drug-resistant cell populations by maintaining a sufficient number of drug-sensitive cells. However, given the heterogeneous treatment response and tolerable tumor burden level of individual patients, determining an effective dose that can fine-tune competitive stress remains challenging. This study presents a mathematical model-driven approach that determines the plausible existence of an effective dose window (EDW) as a range of doses that conserve sufficient sensitive cells while maintaining the tumor volume below a threshold tolerable tumor volume (TTV). We use a mathematical model that explains intratumor cell competition. Analyzing the model, we derive an EDW determined by TTV and the competitive strength. By applying a fixed endpoint optimal control model, we determine the minimal dose to contain cancer at a TTV. As a proof of concept, we study the existence of EDW for a small cohort of melanoma patients by fitting the model to longitudinal tumor response data. We performed identifiability analysis, and for the patients with uniquely identifiable parameters, we deduced patient-specific EDW and minimal dose. The tumor volume for a patient could be theoretically contained at the TTV either using continuous dose or AT strategy with doses belonging to EDW. Further, we conclude that the lower bound of the EDW approximates the minimum effective dose (MED) for containing tumor volume at the TTV.},

  abstract  = {We investigated temperature records associated with seafloor pressure observations at eight stations that experienced the 2011 M _w 9 Tohoku earthquake near its epicenter. The temperature data were based on the temperature measured inside the pressure transducer. We proposed a method to estimate ambient water temperature from the internal temperature using an equation of heat conduction. The estimated seafloor water temperature showed remarkable anomalies, especially increases several hours after the M _w 9 earthquake. A station of P03 (sea depth of 1.1 km) showed an abrupt temperature increase of + 0.19 °C that occurred   3 h after the earthquake, which lasted for several hours. At stations of GJT3 (sea depth of 3.3 km) and TJT1 (sea depth of 5.8 km), there were abrupt temperature anomalies of + 0.20 °C and + 0.10 °C that began to occur 3–4 h after the earthquake. These anomalies both decayed to their original levels over a few tens of days. During the decay processes, only TJT1 showed several intermittent temperature rises. A water temperature anomaly within + 0.03 °C was found up to   500 m above TJT1 2 weeks after the earthquake. There was no significant anomaly at the other five stations. Processes to cause these seafloor temperature anomalies were discussed. The temperature anomaly of P03 was reasonably caused by a tsunami-generated turbidity current, as also suggested by a previous study. Meanwhile, we proposed a scenario that the abrupt temperature anomalies of GJT3/TJT1 and the intermittent anomalies of TJT1 were caused by warm water discharges from the subseafloor. The pathways of the warm water were probably composed of the branch normal fault between GJT3 and TJT1, the reverse fault near TJT1, the backstop interface, and perhaps reverse faults at the frontal prism. The proposed scenario was almost compatible with other studies based on epicentral observations. We estimated the heat properties of the initial temperature anomalies of GJT3/TJT1. The estimated heat source might be explained by that most of the geothermal fluids trapped in those fault pathways were discharged to the seafloor immediately after the earthquake. The onsets of the subsequent intermittent anomalies of TJT1 were possibly activated by low or falling ocean tidal loading.},

  abstract  = {Key message By calibrating and validating a forest growth model for seven species in Germany and coupling it with a wind damage simulator, we specifically estimated the impact of wind damage on the net present value of Norway spruce and European beech in mixture and monoculture. Under risk, the net present value of spruce managements saw the sharpest declines, although the highest end net present value was still obtained through a heavily thinned spruce monoculture. Context Wind damage is one of the most important risks to Central European forests, and adaptation measures are essential. Aim Adaptive management strategies should simultaneously account for forest production and wind risk. We simulated the effect of adaptive measures on wind-risk in German forests. Methods A process-based forest growth model, “3-PG Mix”, was recalibrated and coupled with the storm damage risk model “Lothar”. We investigated the effect of thinning regimes on wind risk in monoculture and mixed species stands. The net present value of the simulated regimes was calculated and compared (risk vs. no risk). Results Spruce regimes achieved the highest net present values when risk was not considered. Considering risk in spruce and beech mixtures and monoculture, all regimes reached values below 3000 € ha^−1 by year 120. The exception was a heavily thinned spruce monoculture at 4507 € ha^−1, being the most profitable regime under risk. Conclusion We conclude, on the basis of this modelling study, that heavy thinning reduced storm risk and maintained a higher net present value in spruce. Species mixture of beech and spruce saw net present values levels remain more constant under risk, while beech monoculture increased.},

Here we investigate whether concepts and approaches from mathematical modelling can provide sociology of quantification with nuanced tools to ensure the methodological soundness, normative adequacy and fairness of numbers. We suggest that methodological adequacy can be upheld by techniques in the field of sensitivity analysis, while normative adequacy and fairness are targeted by the different dimensions of sensitivity auditing. We also investigate in which ways modelling can inform other instances of quantification as to promote political agency.},

  abstract  = {Re-design of microwave passive components for the assumed operating frequencies or substrate parameters is an important yet a tedious process. It requires simultaneous tuning of relevant circuit variables, often over broad ranges thereof, to ensure satisfactory performance of the system. If the operating conditions at the available design are distant from the intended ones, local optimization is typically insufficient, whereas global search entails excessive computational expenses. The problem is aggravated for miniaturized components, typically featuring large numbers of geometry parameters. Furthermore, owing to their tightly-arranged layouts, compact structures exhibit considerable cross-coupling effects. In order to reliably evaluate electrical characteristics under such conditions full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis is mandatory. Needless to say, EM-driven design over broad ranges of operating frequencies is an arduous and costly endeavor. In this paper, we introduce a novel procedure for rapid and reliable re-design of microwave passives. Our methodology involves concurrent scaling of geometry parameters interleaved with local (gradient-based) tuning. The scaling stage allows for low-cost relocation of the operating frequencies of the circuit, whereas the optimization stage ensures continuous (iteration-wise) alignment of the performance figures with their target values. The presented framework is validated using several miniaturized microstrip couplers, re-designed over extended ranges of the center frequencies. For all considered structures, satisfactory designs are successfully identified despite the initial designs being distant from the targets, whereas local tuning turns out to be demonstrably inferior. Apart from its efficacy, one of the most important advantages of the proposed framework is its simplicity, and the lack of problem-dependent control parameters.},

  abstract  = {Currently, several platforms offer solutions for the management and control of fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), addressing a wide range of scenarios, each with its own particular set of objectives. Some of these solutions are mission planning platforms for broader usage, without aiming to solve a single scenario. However, these often either do not support multi-UAV collaboration or generate a static flight trajectory, which does not facilitate the coordination of a fleet of several UAVs in a mission that may need to adapt to the current environment. Through the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) - EasyMission - for UAV mission definition and control, we introduce a mission planning framework that makes it possible to describe mission plans that also enable the user to define adjustments and constraints that may have to be taken into account in real-time according to sensor readings or other events. This framework enables inexperienced users to design missions with low or moderate complexity levels, while still being a useful tool for advanced users due to its versatility in addressing multiple scenarios through a single platform. We show how the mission framework is able to easily define differentiated mission examples with distinct purposes and scenarios, and with real-time decisions and constraints.},

  abstract  = {Heterogeneous computing is the major driving factor in designing new energy-efficient high-performance computing systems. Despite the broad adoption of GPUs and other specialized architectures, the interest in spatial architectures like field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has grown. While combining high performance, low power consumption and high adaptability constitute an advantage, these devices still suffer from a weak software ecosystem, which forces application developers to use tools requiring deep knowledge of the underlying system, often leaving legacy code (e.g., Fortran applications) unsupported. By realizing this, we describe a methodology for porting Fortran (legacy) code on modern FPGA architectures, with the target of preserving performance/power ratios. Aimed as an experience report, we considered an industrial computational fluid dynamics application to demonstrate that our methodology produces synthesizable OpenCL codes targeting Intel Arria10 and Stratix10 devices. Although performance gain is not far beyond that of the original CPU code (we obtained a relative speedup of 
$$\times$$
 ×  0.59 and 
$$\times$$
 ×  0.63, respectively, for a single optimized main kernel, while only on the Stratix10 we achieved 
$$\times$$

This study developed an FE model of the cutting force using ABAQUS and a mathematical model of the cutting force using MATLAB. The FE model was developed based on the Johnson–Cook plastic deformation and the Johnson–Cook damage model. The analytical prediction was developed based on the fluctuated undeformed axial chip thickness and the influence of the longitudinal vibration on the undeformed chip thickness. According to this comparative study, the analytical prediction of the cutting force coded in MATLAB has remarkable similarity with the FE simulation model cutting force. The experimental cutting forces were also carried out to validate both the FE simulation model and the mathematical model. According to the comparison results in the LVAM, the FE simulation model has higher quantitative error than that in the mathematical model, with the highest error in the mathematical model being about 7.146},

  abstract  = {The cubic-polynomial nonlinearity with N -shaped curve plays a crucial role in generating abundant electrical activities for the original FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model. The pioneer FHN neuron model is efficient in theoretical analysis and numerical simulation for these abundant electrical activities, but analog multipliers are indispensable in hardware implementation since the involvement of cubic-polynomial nonlinearity. Analog multiplier goes against the circuit integration of FHN neuron model due to its huge implementation costs. To avoid the involvement of analog multiplier in hardware implementation, a nonlinear function possessing N -shaped curve and multiplier-free implementation is presented in this paper. To confirm the availability of this nonlinear function in generating electrical activities, numerical simulations and hardware experiments are successfully executed on an improved two-dimensional (2D) FHN neuron model with externally applied stimulus. The results demonstrate that the improved FHN neuron model can generate rich electrical activities of periodic spiking behavior, chaotic behavior, and quasi-periodic behavior. Analog circuit implementation without any multiplier and its hardware experiment show the availability of the proposed nonlinear function, which is appropriate for analog circuit implementation of FHN neuron-based neuromorphic intelligence.},

In this paper, we present SPBench , a framework for benchmarking stream processing applications. It aims to support users with a set of real-world stream processing applications, which are made accessible through an Application Programming Interface (API) and executable via Command Line Interface (CLI) to create custom benchmarks. We tested SPBench by implementing parallel benchmarks with Intel Threading Building Blocks ( TBB ), FastFlow , and SPar . This evaluation provided useful insights and revealed the feasibility of the proposed framework in terms of usage, customization, and performance analysis. SPBench demonstrated to be a high-level, reusable, extensible, and easy of use abstraction to build parallel stream processing benchmarks on multi-core architectures.},

  abstract  = {Soil moisture and meteorological variables are strongly related to each other through different fluxes, constituting a complex network of interactions and feedbacks. Therefore, a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture and its relationship with meteorological variables acquires a particular interest, especially under climate change conditions. Based on the gap in studies addressing this topic in Argentina, this study aimed to evaluate soil moisture content (SMC) and water deficit (DEF) annual trends between 1990 and 2019 and the contribution of different meteorological variables to those trends. To this end, simulations of SMCand DEF were performed by using a hydrological balance model, driven by meteorological observations of 51 sites distributed throughout Argentina. Since precipitation (PP) and potential evapotranspiration (PE) modulate the simulated soil moisture, annual PP and PE trends were also evaluated to assess the importance of these variables on the observed soil moisture changes. Furthermore, the regional contribution of the meteorological variables to the PE trends was assessed by means of a detrended method. Trends detected in SMC and DEF suggest an increase towards drier conditions in some areas of the country. Changes in PE were the main responsible for changes in SMC and DEF and were more relevant than changes in PP. In sites located in the center and east of the country, maximum and mean temperatures had a greater impact on PE. In sites located in the west of the country, changes in PE were mainly controlled by increases in wind speed and decreases in humidity. Examining the spatio-temporal variability of soil water and the meteorological variables that influence soil water is indispensable to assess climate-induced changes and propose feasible climate change adaptation strategies.},

  abstract  = {Accurate climate projections help policymakers mitigate the negative effects of climatic changes and prioritize environmental issues based on scientific evidences. These projections rely heavily on the outputs of GCMs (General Circulation Models), but the large number of GCMs and their different outputs in each region confuses researchers in their selection. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of a CMIP6 (Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) multi-model ensemble for Pr (precipitation) data over NE (Northern Europe). First of all, we evaluated the overall performance of 12 CMIP6 models from GCMs in 30 years of 1985–2014. Furthermore, future projections were analyzed between 2071 and 2100 using SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Then, simulations were statistically improved using an ensemble method to correct the systematic error of the CMIP6 models and then the capacity of postprocessed data to reproduce historical trends of climate events was investigated. Finally, the possible spatio-temporal changes of future Pr data were explored in Tana River Basin. The results of this study show that different CMIP6 models do not have the same accuracy in estimating Pr in the study area. However, the ensemble method can be effective in increasing the accuracy of the projections. The results of this study projected a change in the monthly Pr data over Tana River Basin by 2.46},

  abstract  = {Compared to the field of human fMRI, knowledge about functional networks in dogs is scarce. In this paper, we present the first anatomically-defined ROI (region of interest) based functional network map of the companion dog brain. We scanned 33 awake dogs in a “task-free condition”. Our trained subjects, similarly to humans, remain willingly motionless during scanning. Our goal is to provide a reference map with a current best estimate for the organisation of the cerebral cortex as measured by functional connectivity. The findings extend a previous spatial ICA (independent component analysis) study (Szabo et al. in Sci Rep 9(1):1.25. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51752-2 , 2019 ), with the current study including (1) more subjects and (2) improved scanning protocol to avoid asymmetric lateral distortions. In dogs, similarly to humans (Sacca et al. in J Neurosci Methods. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109084 , 2021 ), ageing resulted in increasing framewise displacement (i.e. head motion) in the scanner. Despite the inherently different approaches between model-free ICA and model-based ROI, the resulting functional networks show a remarkable similarity. However, in the present study, we did not detect a designated auditory network. Instead, we identified two highly connected, lateralised multi-region networks extending to non-homotropic regions (Sylvian L, Sylvian R), including the respective auditory regions, together with the associative and sensorimotor cortices and the insular cortex. The attention and control networks were not split into two fully separated, dedicated networks. Overall, in dogs, fronto-parietal networks and hubs were less dominant than in humans, with the cingulate gyrus playing a central role. The current manuscript provides the first attempt to map whole-brain functional networks in dogs via a model-based approach.},

  abstract  = {Model transformations are central to model-driven software development. Applications of model transformations include creating models, handling model co-evolution, model merging, and understanding model evolution. In the past, various (semi-)automatic approaches to derive model transformations from meta-models or from examples have been proposed. These approaches require time-consuming handcrafting or the recording of concrete examples, or they are unable to derive complex transformations. We propose a novel unsupervised approach, called Ockham , which is able to learn edit operations from model histories in model repositories. Ockham is based on the idea that meaningful domain-specific edit operations are the ones that compress the model differences. It employs frequent subgraph mining to discover frequent structures in model difference graphs. We evaluate our approach in two controlled experiments and one real-world case study of a large-scale industrial model-driven architecture project in the railway domain. We found that our approach is able to discover frequent edit operations that have actually been applied before. Furthermore, Ockham is able to extract edit operations that are meaningful—in the sense of explaining model differences through the edit operations they comprise—to practitioners in an industrial setting. We also discuss use cases (i.e., semantic lifting of model differences and change profiles) for the discovered edit operations in this industrial setting. We find that the edit operations discovered by Ockham can be used to better understand and simulate the evolution of models.},

  abstract  = {There is a growing awareness of the importance of human values in software systems. However, limited tools are available to support the integration of human values during software development. Most of these tools are focused on concepts related to specific, well-known human values (e.g., privacy, security) in software engineering. This paper aims to (partially) address this gap by developing a human values dashboard. We conducted a multi-stage study to design, implement and evaluate a human values dashboard. First, an exploratory study was conducted by interviewing 15 software practitioners to investigate the possibility of using a human values dashboard to help address human values in software development, its potential benefits, and required features. Second, we experimented with four Machine Learning approaches to detect the presence of human values in issue discussions. We used the best approach to develop a human values dashboard for software development. The dashboard displays whether any human values are present in each issue discussion. Finally, we interviewed ten different practitioners to investigate the usefulness of the dashboard in practice. This study found that the human values dashboard could help raise awareness, focus attention, and prioritise issues based on the presence of values. This study also identified two potential challenges to the adoption of the dashboard. First, the possible incorrect issues description that can mislead the automated values identification in the dashboard. Second, the lack of willingness of a company to adopt the dashboard.},

  abstract  = {Multi-fidelity metamodeling methods have been widely utilized in the field of complex engineering design to trade off modeling efficiency against model accuracy. To better integrate the information from multi-fidelity models with various correlation and further enhance the universality of multi-fidelity modeling for complex design problems, a general multi-fidelity metamodeling framework namely output scaling multi-fidelity (OS-MF) method is proposed in this paper. The OS-MF metamodeling framework starts with generating high-fidelity and low-fidelity samples by optimal and inherited Latin hypercube sampling methods respectively to fill the parameter space as uniformly as possible. Subsequently, the low-fidelity metamodel is constructed according to Kriging method. For the purpose of approximating the relation between the low-fidelity and high-fidelity outputs, support vector regression is introduced to conveniently generate a single-dimensional output mapping model. Finally, the weighting factors of the above two sub-metamodels and hyperparameters of scaling function are evaluated through the optimization of Kriging maximum likelihood equation. Six numerical examples with different output correlation and two engineering examples are adopted to demonstrate the universality and effectiveness of the OS-MF approach. The proposed method provides an efficient tool for multi-fidelity modeling under various correlation between low-fidelity and high-fidelity outputs.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing tolerances and uncertainties concerning material parameters, e.g., operating conditions or substrate permittivity are detrimental to characteristics of microwave components. The knowledge of relations between acceptable parameter deviations (not leading to violation of design specifications) and the nominal performance (not considering uncertainties), and is therefore indispensable. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization technique of microwave components with tolerance analysis. The goal is to identify a set of trade-off designs: nominal performance versus robustness (quantified by the maximum input tolerance values that allow for achieving 100-percent fabrication yield). Our approach exploits knowledge-driven regression predictors rendered using characteristic points (features) of the component’s response for a rapid evaluation of statistical performance figures, along with trust-region algorithm to enable low execution cost as well as convergence. The proposed methodology is verified with the use of three microstrip circuits, a broadband filter, and two branch-line couplers (a single- and a dual-band one). It is demonstrated that a Pareto set w.r.t. nominal performance and robustness objectives can be produced using only 40 to 60 EM simulations of the respective structure (per design). Reliability of the proposed algorithm is corroborated with the use of EM-based Monte Carlo simulation.},

  abstract  = {Through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI) has attracted a great deal of attention in several sensitive applications, including rescue missions and military operations. Notwithstanding its broad range of applications, TWRI suffers from path-loss because distant targets experience more attenuation of signal power than those closer to the transceiver. This challenge may lead to missed targets with important information necessary for analysis and informed decision making. Responding to the challenge, we have developed a signal model with an effective path-loss compensator incorporating a free space exponent. Furthermore, multipath exploitation and compressive sensing techniques were employed to develop an effective algorithm for isolating residual clutter that may corrupt real targets. The proposed signal model integrates contributions from the front wall, multipath returns, and path-loss. Compared with the state-of-the-art model under the same experimental conditions, simulation results show that the proposed model achieves improved signal-to-clutter ratio, relative clutter peak, and probability of detection by 13.1},

Here, considering the regulation of miR-17-92 in an E2F/Myc genetic circuit, we propose a toy model with coloured noise to focus on the effects of the noise/correlation strength (NS/CS) and the auto/cross-correlation time (AT/CT) on cell phenotype transition and energy cost. The results indicate that increasing AT/CT always slows down the bimodal regulation of NS/CS while extending AT of multiplicative noise amplifies this effect to shift the bimodal regime; the changing trend of the mean first passage time (MFPT) also confirms the regulatory function of noises, i.e., CT attenuates cancer spread induced by increasing CS. Moreover, by reconstructing the effective topology network, we can validate that there is an optimal switching path existed by regulating NS/CS and AT/CT according to the principle of minimum energy consumption, which is nearly independent of CT in the phase plane of CS to CT. The overall analysis indicates that E2F/Myc genetic circuit would regulate NS/CS and AT/CT of noises to achieve phenotype diversity.},

Particularly, the coupling effect of clearance joints and uncertain parameters can further deteriorate the performance of parallel mechanisms. Therefore, the dynamic characteristics and reliability analysis of parallel mechanism with clearance joints and uncertain parameters need to be studied. Combining the strengths of metamodeling and adaptive sequential sampling techniques, an efficient research framework for analyzing the dynamic reliability of spatially parallel mechanisms with clearance joints and uncertain parameters is developed. It can quantify the propagation of parameter uncertainties in dynamical systems and perform dynamic reliability assessment accurately and in real time. Clearance size and driving speed are described as random uncertain parameters, and the dynamic response reliability model of 4-UPS/RPS spatial parallel mechanism with clearance joints and uncertain parameters has been developed by meta-modeling method. The metamodel is updated adaptively by using an active learning function. Effects of clearance size and driving speed on dynamic characteristics and reliability of the mechanism system are evaluated and analyzed. This study can not only be used to optimize the design parameters of parallel mechanisms, but also can provide reference for dynamic reliability modeling and analysis of other mechanisms.},

Two essential factors that influence the determination of the baselines are the data sources of projections and the applied calibration methods. We propose a general, Bayesian approach that can be employed to build a baseline for any recursive-dynamic CGE model. We use metamodeling techniques to transform the calibration problem into a tractable optimization problem while simultaneously reducing the computational costs. This transformation allows us to derive the exogenous model parameters that are needed to match the projections. We demonstrate how to apply the approach using a simple CGE and supply the full code. Additionally, we apply our method to a multi-region, multi-sector model and show that calibrated parameters matter as policy implications derived from simulations differ significantly between them.},

The project concept includes the development of an instrumental computational environment that supports all stages of a large-scale machine experiment: geometric and functional modeling, generating of adaptive unstructured grids of various types and orders, approximation of initial equations, solution of emerging algebraic problems, postprocessing of the obtained results, optimization methods for inverse tasks, and machine learning and decision-making on the results of calculations. The effective functionality of the instrumented computing environment is based on high-performance computing and intelligent big data tools. The architecture of the instrumental computational environment provides for automated expansion of the composition of implemented models and applied algorithms, adaptation to the evolution of supercomputer platforms, user-friendly interfaces and active reuse of external software products, and coordinated participation of different groups of developers, which together should provide a long life cycle and demand for the created ecosystem by a wide range of users from different professional fields.},

  abstract  = {Many patients suffering from oral and maxillofacial tumors cannot open their mouths wide after mandibular reconstruction surgery. Musculoskeletal multibody modeling could be a valuable tool for predicting patient-specific jaw opening functions in the preoperative stage. In this study, a flexible multibody dynamics modeling framework of the human mandibular musculoskeletal system is proposed for surgical planning. In the model, the mandibular muscle bundles are discretized by a flexible cable element combining a typical Hill-type musculotendon model with distributed mass. The mandibular kinematics, together with the electromyographic activities of masticatory muscles, were measured in a patient with a unilateral mandibular tumor. Using the obtained experimental data, a forward–inverse dynamics procedure was proposed to realize the decoupled calculation of synergistic head movement and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dynamics. The surgical planning simulation was driven by the measured activation patterns of the masticatory muscles and the calculated patterns of the jaw opening and pterygoid muscles. The muscle biomechanical parameters in the postoperative model were changed according to the medical imaging measurement of five patients before and after surgical interventions. As validation of the proposed surgical planning method, the predicted maximum jaw gape and mandibular deviations were compared with postoperative measurements. Numerical results further revealed the bistable characteristic of the TMJs together with the alternations of mandibular movement functions caused by muscle-release surgery. The proposed multibody simulation framework provides a novel method for understanding patient-specific pathology of suffering from trismus and assisting in designing treatments and rehabilitation strategies.},

  abstract  = {Purpose The rising of the sharing economy (SE) has lowered the barrier of purchase price to accessing many different products, thus changing the consumer decision paradigm. This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the life cycle impacts of SE systems in the context of this new consumer decision-making process. The paper proposes a methodological framework to integrate consumer preferences into the Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (dynamic-LCA) of SE systems. Methods In the proposed consumer preference integrated dynamic-LCA (C-DLCA) methodological framework, system dynamics (SD) is used to combine consumer preference and the principal method, dynamic-LCA, which follows the ISO 14040 LCA framework. Choice-based conjoint analysis (CBCA) is chosen as the stated preference tool to measure consumer preference based on SE alternatives, attributes and attribute levels. CBCA integrates discrete choice experiments (DCE) and conjoint analysis features. Random utility theory is selected to interpret the CBCA results by employing multinomial logistics as the estimation procedure to derive the utilities. Derived utilities are connected in iterative modelling in the SD and LCA. Dynamic-LCA results are determined based on dynamic process inventory and DCE outcomes and then interpreted aligned with the SD policy scenarios. Results and discussion The C-DLCA framework is applied to assess the GHG changes of the transition to car-based shared mobility in roundtrips to work in the USA. Carpooling and ridesourcing are selected as the shared mobility alternatives based on different occupancy behaviours. Powertrain system and body style are employed as the fleet technology attributes and the latter as an endogenous variable. Dynamic-LCA results are generated considering the high battery electrical vehicle (BEV) adoption as the policy scenario, and results are measured against a service-based functional unit, passenger-kilometre. The model outcomes show a significant reduction in aggregated personal mobility-related dynamic-GHG emissions by transitioning to car-based shared mobility. In contrast to the use phase GHG emissions, the production phase emissions show an increase. The results highlight the importance of integrating consumer preference and temporality in the SE environmental assessments. Conclusions The proposed C-DLCA framework is the first approach to combine consumer preferences, SD and LCA in a single formulation. The structured and practical integration of conjoint analysis, SD and LCA methods added some standardisation to the dynamic-LCAs of the SE systems, and the applicability is demonstrated. The C-DLCA framework is a fundamental structure to connect consumer preferences and temporal effects in LCAs that is expandable based on research scope.},

  abstract  = {Transition in a delayed tumor growth model subjected to non-Gaussian colored noise is investigated. The lifetime of residing in the excited region, and the likelihood of first escaping to the nonexcited region, are characterized via mean first exit time (MFET) and first escape probability (FEP). A shorter MFET or higher FEP, signifying a higher probability of transition and weaker basin stability, favors tumor control in terms of treatment time and cure rate. Stochastic basin of attraction (SBA), introduced for further understanding of basin stability, allows to depict the effectiveness of treatments. Additionally, the average level of MFET and FEP (i.e., AMFET and AFEP) is utilized to examine the whole escape behaviors. The results reveal that (i) enhancing the non-Gaussian noise fluctuation significantly reduces MFET, while time delay modulates MFET in a double-faced manner. Consequently, AMFET acts a non-monotonic dependence on delay under different noise intensities. Comprehensive analysis suggests that a stronger fluctuation combined with a smaller delay is suitable for inducing transition within a shorter residence time. (ii) The larger noise intensity and deviation parameter raise FEP and lessen the size of SBA, thus facilitating transition and weakening basin stability, which means better treatment effectiveness. However, time delay behaves oppositely, suggesting that treatments with excessive delay are less effective and should be avoided in clinical practice. Therefore, to achieve better therapeutic effects in a short treatment time, reinforcing the fluctuation of immune rate caused by microenvironmental factors and shortening the reaction time of human bodies to treatments are recommended.},

  abstract  = {Crop production in East Africa (i.e., Sudan and Ethiopia), where economy relies largely on rainfed agriculture, is facing significant challenges due to climate change, population growth, and the slow adoption rate of agricultural technology. However, a lack of consensus exists on how near-term climate change may affect food crop productivity in the region through changes in temperature and precipitation. Here, we empirically estimate optimal-growing temperature and precipitation for a select group of food crops using historical observations. We then project climate change impacts on crop yields based on a non-parametric empirical crop model using, as input, results from high-resolution (20 km) regional climate model driven by CMIP5/CMIP6 global climate models. Our projections consistently show increases in growing season temperature and precipitation during 2021–2050 under RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, relative to 1976–2000. However, the projected climate change will exert dramatically different impacts on the agricultural sectors across the region. That is, the significant warming would likely cause overall negative impacts on agriculture in Sudan and mixed impacts on agriculture in Ethiopia. Meanwhile, the weak wetting trend may marginally affect crop growth in East Africa. The negative impacts of climate change can be mitigated at least partially by an accelerating rate of adoption of agricultural technology (use of fertilizers, better seeds, etc.) and probably by horizontal expansion of croplands where precipitation is projected to increase. Our results suggest that East Africa will need to take proactive adaptation measures to mitigate the projected food production challenges.},

  abstract  = {It is known that the Hadley circulation (HC) is responsible for the typical wet climate of the tropics and the dry climate of the subtropics. Previous studies have shown that the HC exhibits a poleward expansion of   0.5–1° latitude per decade with significant regional and seasonal variability. Owing to its pivotal role in controlling the climate over tropics and subtropics, it is important to predict the evolution of HC in a future warming scenario from the perspective of formulation of adaptation strategies. In this regard, the current study employs the climate model simulations from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology-Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) archived in the latest Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) to identify the long-term changes and future projections in the width of the ascending and descending branches of the HC, after validating it against the latest generation ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that the model is able to capture the observed changes in the total width of the HC and its ascending regions. Analysis of trends in the future projection of the width of the HC ascending and descending regions brings out results that are consistent with earlier reports using multi-model simulations archived in CMIP6. The future projections of HC intensity show weakening tendencies in both NH and SH. The trends in the model’s future projection of zonal mean precipitation under two high forcing scenarios show hemispherical asymmetry with SH exhibiting relatively strong trends in both ascending and descending regions of the HC. The results are discussed in the light of the present understanding on HC dynamics. The significance of the present study lies in evaluating IITM-ESM, which is the first model from India to participate in CMIP, using ERA5 reanalysis and discussing the future projections of HC dynamics and its implications on long-term trends in precipitation under high forcing scenarios.},

We point out that the major difference between the model results and the tide gauge data may be due to the vertical land movements (VLMs) at the tide gauge stations, despite the JMA’s assumption that the VLMs are relatively small there.

The peak is created by coastal trapped waves (CTWs), which are excited when positive sea level anomalies produced by change in wind stress, propagate westward as baroclinic Rossby waves and reach Japan. From idealized experiments, we find that the first EOF mode is well reproduced by the CTWs excited east of Hokkaido.},

  abstract  = {Branch architecture is a key determinant of plant performance owing to its role in a light interception by photosynthetic tissues. However, under stressed conditions, excess light may be harmful to the photosynthetic apparatus, and plants often present structural mechanisms to avoid photoinhibition. Three-dimensional models were constructed of the aerial parts in different locations within the crown of three co-occurring tree species ( Quercus ilex , Q. suber and Q. faginea ) growing in a Mediterranean environment. We hypothesized that the species with the shorter leaf life span would exhibit higher leaf display efficiency (silhouette to total leaf area, STAR), maximizing light interception and photosynthesis in the short term. In addition, more exposed positions within a canopy should develop more structural avoidance mechanisms to minimize excessive radiation. Significant differences were detected in architectural traits at both the intra- and interspecific level. Architectural traits promoting greater self-shading were more frequent in the species with longer leaf longevity and in the canopy locations experiencing higher temperatures at the times of maximum sunlight. However, these trends were in part counteracted by the changes in individual leaf area, which tended to be larger in the species with shorter leaf longevity and in the less exposed canopy locations. We conclude that the variation in architectural traits occurs mainly as a means to avoid the excessive self-shading of branches with the largest leaf size.},

  abstract  = {The sunspot cycle is the magnetic cycle of the Sun produced by the dynamo process. A central idea of the solar dynamo is that the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic fields of the Sun sustain each other. We discuss the relevant observational data both for sunspots (which are manifestations of the toroidal field) and for the poloidal field of the Sun. We point out how the differential rotation of the Sun stretches out the poloidal field to produce the toroidal field primarily at the bottom of the convection zone, from where parts of this toroidal field may rise due to magnetic buoyancy to produce sunspots. In the flux transport dynamo model, the decay of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs gives rise to the poloidal field by the Babcock–Leighton mechanism. In this type of model, the meridional circulation of the Sun, which is poleward at the solar surface and equatorward at the bottom of the convection zone, plays a crucial role in the transport of magnetic fluxes. We finally point out that various stochastic fluctuations associated with the dynamo process may play a key role in producing the irregularities of the sunspot cycle.},

  abstract  = {Background Heme proteins, such as hemoglobin, horseradish peroxidase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme, are highly versatile and have widespread applications in the fields of food, healthcare, medical and biological analysis. As a cofactor, heme availability plays a pivotal role in proper folding and function of heme proteins. However, the functional production of heme proteins is usually challenging mainly due to the insufficient supply of intracellular heme. Results Here, a versatile high-heme-producing Escherichia coli chassis was constructed for the efficient production of various high-value heme proteins. Initially, a heme-producing Komagataella phaffii strain was developed by reinforcing the C4 pathway-based heme synthetic route. Nevertheless, the analytical results revealed that most of the red compounds generated by the engineered K. phaffii strain were intermediates of heme synthesis which were unable to activate heme proteins. Subsequently, E. coli strain was selected as the host to develop heme-producing chassis. To fine-tune the C5 pathway-based heme synthetic route in E. coli , fifty-two recombinant strains harboring different combinations of heme synthesis genes were constructed. A high-heme-producing mutant Ec -M13 was obtained with negligible accumulation of intermediates. Then, the functional expression of three types of heme proteins including one dye-decolorizing peroxidase (Dyp), six oxygen-transport proteins (hemoglobin, myoglobin and leghemoglobin) and three CYP153A subfamily CYP enzymes was evaluated in Ec -M13. As expected, the assembly efficiencies of heme-bound Dyp and oxygen-transport proteins expressed in Ec -M13 were increased by 42.3–107.0},

  abstract  = {Machine learning (ML) has powerful nonlinear processing and multivariate learning capabilities, so it has been widely utilised in the fatigue field. However, most ML methods are inexplicable black-box models that are difficult to apply in engineering practice. Symbolic regression (SR) is an interpretable machine learning method for determining the optimal fitting equation for datasets. In this study, domain knowledge-guided SR was used to determine a new fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate model. Three terms of the variable subtree of Δ K , R -ratio, and Δ K _th were obtained by analysing eight traditional semi-empirical FCG rate models. Based on the FCG rate test data from other literature, the SR model was constructed using Al-7055-T7511. It was subsequently extended to other alloys (Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al, Ti-6Al-4V, Cr-Mo-V, LC9cs, Al-6013-T651, and Al-2324-T3) using multiple linear regression. Compared with the three semi-empirical FCG rate models, the SR model yielded higher prediction accuracy. This result demonstrates the potential of domain knowledge-guided SR for building the FCG rate model.},

A key driving factor behind rapid Arctic climate change is black carbon, the atmospheric aerosol that most efficiently absorbs sunlight. Our knowledge about black carbon in the Arctic is scarce, mainly limited to long-term measurements of a few ground stations and snap-shots by aircraft observations. Here, we combine observations from aircraft campaigns performed over nine years, and present vertically resolved average black carbon properties. A factor of four higher black carbon mass concentration (21.6 ng m^−3 average, 14.3 ng m^−3 median) was found in spring, compared to summer (4.7 ng m^−3 average, 3.9 ng m^−3 median). In spring, much higher inter-annual and geographic variability prevailed compared to the stable situation in summer. The shape of the black carbon size distributions remained constant between seasons with an average mass mean diameter of 202 nm in spring and 210 nm in summer. Comparison between observations and concentrations simulated by a global model shows notable discrepancies, highlighting the need for further model developments and intensified measurements.},

  abstract  = {Indigo is an economically important dye, especially for the textile industry and the dyeing of denim fabrics for jeans and garments. Around 80,000 tonnes of indigo are chemically produced each year with the use of non-renewable petrochemicals and the use and generation of toxic compounds. As many microorganisms and their enzymes are able to synthesise indigo after the expression of specific oxygenases and hydroxylases, microbial fermentation could offer a more sustainable and environmentally friendly manufacturing platform. Although multiple small-scale studies have been performed, several existing research gaps still hinder the effective translation of these biochemical approaches. No article has evaluated the feasibility and relevance of the current understanding and development of indigo biocatalysis for real-life industrial applications. There is no record of either established or practically tested large-scale bioprocess for the biosynthesis of indigo. To address this, upstream and downstream processing considerations were carried out for indigo biosynthesis. 5 classes of potential biocatalysts were identified, and 2 possible bioprocess flowsheets were designed that facilitate generating either a pre-reduced dye solution or a dry powder product. Furthermore, considering the publicly available data on the development of relevant technology and common bioprocess facilities, possible platform and process values were estimated, including titre, DSP yield, potential plant capacities, fermenter size and batch schedule. This allowed us to project the realistic annual output of a potential indigo biosynthesis platform as 540 tonnes. This was interpreted as an industrially relevant quantity, sufficient to provide an annual dye supply to a single industrial-size denim dyeing plant. The conducted sensitivity analysis showed that this anticipated output is most sensitive to changes in the reaction titer, which can bring a 27.8},

  abstract  = {Regressions created from experimental or simulated data enable the construction of metamodels, widely used in a variety of engineering applications. Many engineering problems involve multi-parametric physics whose corresponding multi-parametric solutions can be viewed as a sort of computational vademecum that, once computed offline, can be then used in a variety of real-time engineering applications including optimization, inverse analysis, uncertainty propagation or simulation based control. Sometimes, these multi-parametric problems can be solved by using advanced model order reduction—MOR-techniques. However, solving these multi-parametric problems can be very costly. In that case, one possibility consists in solving the problem for a sample of the parametric values and creating a regression from all the computed solutions. The solution for any choice of the parameters is then inferred from the prediction of the regression model. However, addressing high-dimensionality at the low data limit, ensuring accuracy and avoiding overfitting constitutes a difficult challenge. The present paper aims at proposing and discussing different advanced regressions based on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) enabling the just referred features. In particular, new PGD strategies are developed adding different regularizations to the s -PGD method. In addition, the ANOVA-based PGD is proposed to ally them.},

  abstract  = {Background Apis cerana is widely distributed in China and, prior to the introduction of western honeybees, was the only bee species kept in China. During the long-term natural evolutionary process, many unique phenotypic variations have occurred among A. cerana populations in different geographical regions under varied climates. Understanding the molecular genetic basis and the effects of climate change on the adaptive evolution of A. cerana can promote A. cerana conservation in face of climate change and allow for the effective utilization of its genetic resources. Result To investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic variations and the impact of climate change on adaptive evolution, A. cerana workers from 100 colonies located at similar geographical latitudes or longitudes were analyzed. Our results revealed an important relationship between climate types and the genetic variation of A. cerana in China, and a greater influence of latitude compared with longitude was observed. Upon selection and morphometry analyses combination for populations under different climate types, we identified a key gene RAPTOR, which was deeply involved in developmental processes and influenced the body size. Conclusion The selection of RAPTOR at the genomic level during adaptive evolution could allow A. cerana to actively regulate its metabolism, thereby fine-tuning body sizes in response to harsh conditions caused by climate change, such as food shortages and extreme temperatures, which may partially elucidate the size differences of A. cerana populations. This study provides crucial support for the molecular genetic basis of the expansion and evolution of naturally distributed honeybee populations.},

  abstract  = {Ascariasis is the most prevalent zoonotic helminthic disease worldwide, and is responsible for nutritional deficiencies, particularly hindering the physical and neurological development of children. The appearance of anthelmintic resistance in Ascaris is a risk for the target of eliminating ascariasis as a public health problem by 2030 set by the World Health Organisation. The development of a vaccine could be key to achieving this target. Here we have applied an in silico approach to design a multi-epitope polypeptide that contains T-cell and B-cell epitopes of reported novel potential vaccination targets, alongside epitopes from established vaccination candidates. An artificial toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) adjuvant (RS09) was added to improve immunogenicity. The constructed peptide was found to be non-allergic, non-toxic, with adequate antigenic and physicochemical characteristics, such as solubility and potential expression in Escherichia coli . A tertiary structure of the polypeptide was used to predict the presence of discontinuous B-cell epitopes and to confirm the molecular binding stability with TLR2 and TLR4 molecules. Immune simulations predicted an increase in B-cell and T-cell immune response after injection. This polypeptide can now be validated experimentally and compared to other vaccine candidates to assess its possible impact in human health.},

  abstract  = {The use of prototypes in requirements engineering has widely known benefits since they actively involve the stakeholders in the development process. Web Augmentation techniques make it possible to build prototypes relying on existing web applications. Thus, high fidelity mockups can be quickly generated. One of the most critical activities is dividing requirements into tasks and managing them through the development process. This paper proposes an approach that includes high fidelity mockups into the Task-oriented Development approach. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: (i) end-users specifies requirements, (ii) a product owner verifies and prioritizes the requirements, (iii) tasks are defined and included in a kanban board, (iv) developers should provide the functionality, and (v) the product owner should approved the functionality. The main contribution of this approach is to integrate the requirements specified through web augmentation mockups, into the development environment via a task-oriented development approach. Thus, developers will have a rich context that facilitates the understanding of the requirements. At the same time, the management of the development process will have benefits because of the traceability between tasks and requirements. This paper describes the approach proposed, called “WAMRI”, and an application of its usage, as well as a tool to support the application.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic urban link travel speed estimation (DU-LSE) problem has been studied extensively with approaches ranging from model to data driven since it benefits multiple applications in transport mobility, especially in dense cities. However, with drawbacks such as heavy assumption in model-driven and not being capable for big city network in data-driven, there has not been a consensus on the most effective method. This study aims to develop a Sequential Three Step framework to solve the DU-LSE problem using only the passively collected taxi trip data. The framework makes use of two deep learning models namely Traffic Graph Convolution (TGCN) and its recurrent variant TGCN_lstm to capture both spatial and temporal correlation between road segments. The proposed framework has three advantages over similar approaches: (1) it uses only the affordable taxi data and overcomes the data’s incompleteness both in spatial (full GPS trajectory is not available) and temporal (incomplete historic time-series) domain, (2) it is specifically designed to preserve the directionality nature of traffic flow, and (3) it is capable for large networks. The model results and validations suggest the framework can achieve high enough accuracy and will provide valuable mobility data for cities especially those without traffic sensing infrastructure already in place.},

  volume    = {16},
  abstract  = {Insect outbreaks are a common multicausal population phenomenon that is characterised by a fast growth of the population, followed by an equally sudden collapse in a relatively short period in the manner of an excitable system. If the outbreaking insect is herbivorous or attacks trees or plants as a part of its life cycle, this phenomenon causes a major impact on the plant’s population. As a consequence, outbreaks are a major cause of vegetation loss and tree mortality in ecosystems. Among the several causes of outbreaks, climatic/environmental variation is one of the most important. For example, droughts can weaken plant defences making them more susceptible to insect herbivore attacks. As the climatic-driven effects on plant populations are correlated to time and space, not only the type of variability but also its magnitude, are of key importance for the appearance of this phenomenon. In theoretical studies, noise colour is usually used as a proxy to represent the variability of forcing external variables, such as climate. In this study, we conducted a series of simulations using a spatially explicit model to analyse the effect of combining several types of spatial and temporal environmental noise colours (red, pink, white, blue, violet, and grey) on the frequency of outbreaks. We found that the frequency of outbreaks increased with the autocorrelation of noise. The combination of spatial and temporal white noise showed a low-risk scenario, while pink noise had a much higher frequency of this phenomenon. However, the combination of spatial grey noise (a noise composed of both low and high frequencies), with temporal low-frequency noise, resulted in all simulations causing severe outbreaks. We suggest two explanations for this. On one hand, the presence of high-frequency noise gave the herbivore the ability to percolate through refugees caused by the low-frequency noise; and, on the other hand, low-frequency temporal noise gave the herbivore time to kill all simulated host plants.},

Ein funktionsorientierter Entwicklungsprozess mit Methoden des Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) verspricht, technische Lösungen über lösungsneutrale Funktionsarchitekturen zu identifizieren. Da jede Funktion typischerweise durch mehrere, alternative Lösungen realisiert werden kann, explodiert die kombinatorische Anzahl möglicher Gesamtsystemlösungen. Bestehende MBSE-Ansätze unterstützen sowohl die Erstellung funktionaler Architekturen als auch die Verifikation von Gesamtsystemlösungen. Die Evaluierung verschiedener Lösungskombinationen erfordert nach dem derzeitigen Stand der Forschung jedoch eine wiederholte und zeitaufwändige Modellierung, die zu einer heuristischen Auswahl potentiell suboptimaler Lösungen führen kann. In diesem Beitrag wird eine Methode zur systematischen und funktionsorientierten Erstellung und modellbasierten Bewertung von Lösungskombinationen vorgestellt. Alternative Lösungen werden auf Basis einer funktionalen Architektur strukturiert, so dass jede mögliche Lösungskombination unter Berücksichtigung physikalischer Wechselwirkungen und der Effizienz mit minimalem Aufwand gebildet und simuliert werden kann. Basierend auf den Simulationsergebnissen können Lösungskombinationen anhand der Anforderungen verifiziert und bewertet werden, um die beste Lösungskombination zu finden. Die erarbeitete Methode erweitert einen bestehenden MBSE-Ansatz und wird am Beispiel einer elektrischen Kühlmittelpumpe erläutert. Increasing complexity and shorter innovation cycles require a rethink in the development of mechatronic products. A function-oriented development process using model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods promises to identify technical solutions via solution-neutral functional architectures. Since each function can typically be realized by multiple, alternative solutions the combinatorial number of overall system solutions explodes. Existing MBSE approaches enable to establish functional architectures as well as support the verification of solutions. However, evaluating different solution combinations with the current state of research involves repetitive and time-consuming modeling which leads to a heuristic selection of potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we present a method for the systematic and function-oriented composition and model-based evaluation of solution combinations. Alternative solutions are structured based on a functional architecture, so that each possible solution combination can be composed and simulated with a minimum of effort, considering physical interactions and the efficiency. Based on simulation results, solution combinations can be verified against requirements and evaluated striving for the best solution combination. The elaborated method extends an existing MBSE approach and is illustrated by the running example of an electrical coolant pump of a passenger vehicle.},

  abstract  = {Within maintenance management activities, engineers need to select maintenance strategies so to carry out the technical maintenance actions. A single equipment is composed of several components with different failure modes. There should be a maintenance strategy for each of them; while some of the components can be run-to-failure applying corrective maintenance, some others cannot afford a failure, and preventive or predictive strategies should be implemented. Selecting and assessing maintenance strategies is a complex task for which information from many sources should be retrieved. Information from a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis, a cost–benefit-risk analysis, Computational Maintenance Management Systems, is often used by engineers to select and assess maintenance strategies. A selected strategy is often not evaluated over time to check its effectiveness. The strategy may need adjustments or substituted by a more efficient one, for example, a condition-based strategy substituting a time-based one. To facilitate maintenance strategies selection and assessment, the current study proposes an Ontology model for Maintenance Strategy Selection and Assessment (OMSSA). OMSSA serves as a formal terminology framework in maintenance strategies that can be used to develop smart computational agents that can help in the decision-making process for selecting and assessing maintenance strategies. To facilitate its future reuse and integration with other ontologies in the industrial domain, OMSSA builds following the state-of-the-art in ontology development by using a top-level domain-neutral ontology, the Basic Formal Ontology.},

  abstract  = {Process recommendation is an essential technique to help process modeler effectively and efficiently model a manufacturing process from scratch. However, the current process recommendation methods suffer from the following problems: (1) To extract all the execution paths from a manufacturing process, the behavior-based methods may occur a state space explosion problem when unfolding a process with multiple parallel patterns, resulting in low efficiency. (2) Current structure-based methods are inefficient since too many expensive computations of the graph edit distance are involved. (3) Most of the existing methods manually design their process similarity metrics with several features, which can only be applied in specific situations. (4) Few works provide visualization tools for process modeling assistance. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a context-aware recommendation system for improving manufacturing process modeling. First, the independent paths and P,Q-grams are efficiently extracted from the manufacturing processes in the repository to represent their typical behavior and structure. Then, the process recommendation problem is transformed into the word prediction problem in natural language processing, where the serialization of an independent path/P,Q-gram and a node in it are separately regarded as a sentence and a word. The Word2vec model is introduced to automatically learn the relationships among nodes from independent paths and P,Q-grams and generate the vectors with hundreds of context-aware features for nodes in the repository. After that, the top- k similar nodes are recommended for the target node in the process fragment under construction based on the k -nearest neighbors algorithm. Finally, a visualization tool is provided for process modelers to efficiently design a new manufacturing process. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can perform similar or even better than the baseline methods in terms of recommending quality.},

  abstract  = {Die unter dem Begriff Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) zusammengefassten akustischen und strukturdynamischen Eigenschaften von Fahrzeugen sind ein entscheidendes Kriterium bei der Produktentwicklung. Um zeit- und kostenintensive Iterationen mit physischen Prototypen zu reduzieren, haben NVH-Simulationsmodelle in den Entwicklungsalltag Einzug erhalten. In frühen Entwicklungsphasen werden viele Parameter von NVH-Modellen, wie z. B. Material- und Kontakteigenschaften, entweder auf der Grundlage empirischer Werte angenommen oder müssen gemessen werden. In beiden Fällen ist der Wert dieser Parameter mit Unsicherheiten behaftet. Somit ist auch die Ausgangsgröße von NVH-System-Simulationsmodellen, wie bspw. Körper- oder Luftschall, Unsicherheiten unterworfen, die quantifiziert werden müssen. Die Anwendung moderner Methoden der Unsicherheitsanalyse auf NVH-Simulationsmodelle unter Berücksichtigung aller unsicheren Eingangsparameter ist jedoch aufgrund der hohen Rechenzeit ineffizient. Daher wird in diesem Beitrag eine Methode der gekoppelten Sensitivitäts- (SA) und Unsicherheitsanalyse (UA) vorgestellt, die eine effiziente Unsicherheitsberechnung für NVH-Simulationen ermöglicht. Bei dieser Methode werden zunächst die einflussreichsten Parameter mit Hilfe einer SA bestimmt, um die Anzahl der Eingabeparameter zu reduzieren. Abhängig von der Anzahl der Parameter und der Berechnungszeit des NVH-Simulationsmodells wird entweder die Morris SA oder eine EFAST SA gewählt. Abschließend wird eine Fuzzy-UA durchgeführt, die die Unsicherheit der Ausgabe der NVH-Simulation quantifiziert und ihre möglichen Bereiche angibt. Das Verfahren wird auf das NVH-Modell zur Vorhersage des Luftschalls eines elektrifizierten Antriebsstrangs mit 53 unsicheren Eingangsparametern angewandt. The acoustic and structural dynamic properties of vehicles—often referred to as Noise, Vibration, Harshness (NVH)—form a crucial criterion during product development. To reduce iterations with physical prototypes, NVH simulation models are well established. In early development phases, many parameters of NVH models, such as material and contact properties, are either assumed based on empirical values or have to be measured. In both cases, the value of these parameters is uncertain. Thus, the output of NVH system simulation models such as structure borne or air borne sound is also uncertain and must be quantified. However, applying state-of-the-art uncertainty analysis methods to NVH simulation models considering all uncertain input parameters is inefficient due to their high computation time. Therefore, this paper presents a method of coupled sensitivity (SA) and uncertainty analysis (UA), which enables the efficient uncertainty calculation for NVH simulations. In this method, firstly the most influential parameters are determined using a SA to reduce the number of input parameters. Depending on the number of parameters and the computation time of the NVH simulation model, either the Morris SA or an EFAST SA is chosen. Finally, a fuzzy UA is performed, which quantifies the uncertainty of the output of the NVH simulation and provides its possible ranges. The procedure is applied to the NVH model for predicting air borne sound of an electric drive with 53 uncertain input parameters.},

Digital business markets encompass eminent features like increased transparency, enhanced customer relationship, flexible business targets, customer participation, etc. It aids in enhancing traditional business quality by bridging the relationship between the suppliers and the customers. The massive development of internet technology in recent years has largely contributed to the emergence of digital business. The digitization of the business world helps small and medium enterprises create a new digital network, which allows overcoming large enterprises' dominance. Since small and medium enterprises play a major role in determining a country's economy, the digital market's emergence and development are very important. The self-organizing capability of the digital market is the main advantage for newly emerging enterprises. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in customers' migration from offline shopping to the online market. These changing business models mandate the need for policies and control mechanisms. Using these policies, digital business projects are developed using an open environment using which the small and medium enterprises can interact with each other. These policies and control mechanisms outline the rules to be followed to avoid the current digital market issues. These policies must be designed to improve and ensure the welfare of future digital business systems. Thus, this paper aims to explore the policies associated with regulating and promoting the digital business economy.},

  abstract  = {Environmental contamination due to pest control in general, and mosquito control in particular, is an important issue expected to increase with climate change. We use a validated model for population dynamics of mosquitoes and historical environmental data to explore performance of larvicidal, adulticidal, and combined treatments. Results show that depending on treatment timing, larvicidal treatments can induce very good results, or have negative outcomes that increase overall mosquito population. Combined larvicidal and adulticidal treatments, however, exhibit much lesser dependence on timing, and therefore give the greatest chance of positive outcomes if environmental conditions are not known. Based on the results, we argue for adaptive mosquito management, in which weather data and forecasts are used to drive a model that identifies best intervals for insecticide use. Such an approach can have considerably better results than static, calendar-driven management and, therefore, considerably reduce environmental contamination. Adaptive management could consider larvicidal treatment because it gives good results if the timing is correct. Static management should, however, combine larvicidal and adulticidal treatments for the greatest chance of success.},

  abstract  = {Erfolgreiche Produkte erfüllen die Erwartungen der Kunden und übertreffen sie im besten Fall. Um erfolgreiche Produkte zu entwickeln, müssen die Kundenerwartungen in Anforderungen umgesetzt werden. Mit der zunehmenden Funktionalität von Produkten in den letzten Jahren sind auch die Erwartungen der Kunden an ihre Interaktion mit dem Produkt und dessen Verhalten in unterschiedlichen Umgebungsbedingungen umfangreicher geworden. Aktuelle Ansätze des Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) ermöglichen es, komplexe mechatronische Produkte nahtlos von den Anforderungen zu den Funktionen und Lösungen bis auf Parameterebene zu entwickeln. Es fehlt jedoch an Ansätzen, die komplexe Kundenerwartungen systematisch in funktionale und gestalterische Anforderungen als Ausgangspunkt für die weitere Entwicklung übersetzen. In diesem Beitrag stellen wir eine Methode und ein entsprechendes Metamodell vor, das es erlaubt, die Abhängigkeiten zwischen verschiedenen Stakeholdern und deren Erwartungen sowie unterschiedlichen Umweltbedingungen und Randbedingungen systematisch zu formalisieren. Aus diesen Abhängigkeiten werden Betriebszustände abgeleitet, die eine Menge gleichzeitig gültiger Stakeholder-Erwartungen mit den entsprechenden Einschränkungen darstellen. Aus diesen Betriebszuständen werden systematisch funktionale und gestalterische Anforderungen abgeleitet, die die Grundlage für den modellbasierten Entwurf des zu entwickelnden Systems bilden. Das Metamodell ist kompatibel zu der etablierten Modellierungssprache SysML, so dass bestehende Ansätze zur funktionsorientierten modellbasierten Systementwicklung direkt von diesen formal modellierten Anforderungen profitieren können. Diese Veröffentlichung zeigt das Potenzial für eine systematische und formale Übersetzung von Kundenerwartungen in Betriebszustände sowie Anforderungen auf und ermöglicht so eine zielgerichtete, kundenzentrierte und funktionsorientierte Entwicklung mechatronischer Systeme. Die Methode wurde in einem interdisziplinären, industriellen Projekt am Beispiel des Thermomanagementsystems eines batterieelektrischen Fahrzeugs angewendet. Successful products at least precisely meet the customers’ expectations and, in the best case, exceed them. To develop successful products, customer expectations must be translated into requirements. With the increasing functionalities of products in recent years, the customers’ expectations regarding product interaction and its behavior in different environmental conditions have also become more extensive. Current approaches of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) enable developing complex mechatronic products seamlessly from requirements to functions and solutions on a parameter level. However, there is a lack of approaches that systematically translate complex customer expectations into functional and design requirements as a starting point for further development. In this contribution we present a method and a corresponding meta-model that allows to systematically formalize the dependencies of different stakeholders and their expectations as well as different environmental conditions and constraints. From these dependencies, operating states are elicited that represent a set of simultaneously valid stakeholder expectations with their corresponding constraints. From these operating states, functional and design requirements are systematically derived as a basis for the model-based design of the system under development. Our meta-model is compatible to the established modeling language SysML, thus, existing approaches for the function-oriented model-based system development can benefit directly from these formally modeled requirements. Our publication signposts the potential for systematic and formal translation of customer expectations into operating states as well as requirements and thus enables a targeted, customer-centric and function-oriented development of mechatronic systems. We applied our method in an interdisciplinary, industrial project using the example of a thermal management system of a battery electric vehicle.},

  abstract  = {The computation of the steady-stateresponse of large finite element discretized systems subject to periodic excitations is unfeasible because of excessive run time and memory requirements. One could in principle resort to reduced order models stemming from the high fidelity counterparts, which typically require a solution time orders of magnitude smaller. However, when many simulations are required, as in the case of parametric studies, the overall effort could be still significant and the analysis process could be severely hindered. In this work, we propose a sensitivity approach to assess the influence of model parameters on the nonlinear dynamic response. As opposed to the costly evaluation of reduced order solutions over a range of excitation frequencies and model parameters, the sensitivities of a nominal response allow one to approximate the dynamic response by a simple evaluation of an expansion in the directions spanning the parameter space. Special care must be taken on the closure equation that needs to be appended to the system of equations stemming from the harmonic balance method. We discuss the limitations of the current constant frequency approach and propose an improvement. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach on a micro-electro-mechanical system affected by parameterized manufacturing defects. Leveraging from a previous contribution, the nonlinear response and the sensitivities are obtained from a reduced order model which is analytical in the defect parameters. Our procedure is able to deliver accurate probability density functions of quantities of interest (e.g. nonlinear resonance peaks, triple solution bandwidth, etc) against statistical distributions of manufacturing defects at negligible computational cost.},

  volume    = {87},
  abstract  = {With the coming installation of hundreds of GW of offshore wind power, penetration of the inherent power fluctuations into the electricity grid will become significant. Therefore, the use of wind farms as power reserve providers to support the regulation of the grid’s voltage and frequency through delivering a desired power is expected to increase. As a result, wind turbines will not be necessarily delivering the maximum available power anymore – known as curtailed or derated operation – and will have to be able to deal with time-variant power demand. For this purpose, power setpoints from the grid are dispatched at the farm-level and then tracked at the turbine-level under the constraint of available power in the wind (known as active power control). The idea of this work is taking advantage of the additional degree of freedom lying in the power dispatch between turbines when operating in curtailed conditions. As failure of power train system components is frequent, costly and predictable, we seek to introduce power train degradation into the farm control objectives. To this end, a data-driven model of drivetrain fatigue damage as function of wind conditions and derating factor adapted to the farm active power control objective function is developed based on the pre-analysis of single-turbine simulations and degradation calculations, where the increased turbulence intensity due to wind farm wake effect is also considered. The proposed analytical power train degradation model is computationally efficient, can reflect the fatigue damage of individual gears and bearings in the overall power train life function and in contrast with high-fidelity models can be easily adjusted for different drivetrain configurations. A case study on the TotalControl reference wind power plant is demonstrated. Mit der bevorstehenden Installation von Hunderten von Gigawatt Offshore-Windenergie werden die inhärenten Leistungsschwankungen im Stromnetz erheblich zunehmen. Daher wird erwartet, dass Windparks zunehmend als Leistungsreserve eingesetzt werden, um die Regulierung der Netzspannung und -frequenz durch die Lieferung einer gewünschten Leistung zu unterstützen. Infolgedessen werden Windturbinen nicht mehr unbedingt die maximal verfügbare Leistung liefern können – bekannt als “curtailed” oder “derated” Betrieb – und müssen in der Lage sein, mit zeitlich schwankendem Leistungsbedarf umzugehen. Zu diesem Zweck werden Leistungssollwerte aus dem Netz auf der Parkebene vorgegeben und dann auf der Turbinenebene unter der Bedingung der verfügbaren Windleistung nachgeführt (sogenannte aktive Leistungsregelung oder “active power control”). Die Idee dieser Arbeit ist es, den zusätzlichen Freiheitsgrad zu nutzen, der in der Leistungsverteilung zwischen den Turbinen liegt, wenn diese unter eingeschränkten Bedingungen betrieben werden. Da Ausfälle von Komponenten des Antriebsstrangs häufig, kostspielig und vorhersehbar sind, versuchen wir, die Verschlechterung des Antriebsstrangs in die Steuerungsziele des Parks einzubeziehen. Zu diesem Zweck wird ein datengesteuertes Modell der Ermüdungsschäden des Antriebsstrangs als Funktion der Windbedingungen und des Abminderungsfaktors entwickelt, das an die Zielfunktion der Leistungsregelung des Parks angepasst ist und auf der Voranalyse von Simulationen und Degradationsberechnungen für eine einzelne Turbine basiert, wobei auch die erhöhte Turbulenzintensität aufgrund des Windpark-Wake-Effekts berücksichtigt wird. Das vorgeschlagene analytische Degradationsmodell für den Antriebsstrang ist rechnerisch effizient, kann die Ermüdungsschäden einzelner Zahnräder und Lager in der Gesamtlebensdauerfunktion des Antriebsstrangs widerspiegeln und lässt sich im Gegensatz zu High-Fidelity-Modellen leicht an unterschiedliche Antriebsstrangkonfigurationen anpassen. Eine Fallstudie an der TotalControl-Referenz-Windkraftanlage wird demonstriert.},

  abstract  = {Scaled experimentation is an important approach for the investigation of complex systems but for centuries has been impeded by the want of a scaling theory that can accommodate scale effects. The present definition of a scale effect is founded on the violation of an invariance principle arising out of dimensional analysis, i.e. dimensionless equations do not change with scale. However, apart from all but the most rudimentary of systems, most dimensionless governing equations invariably do change with scale, thus providing a very severe constraint on the reach of scaled experimentation. This paper introduces the theory of scaling that in principle applies to all physics and quantifies either implicitly or explicitly all scale dependencies. It is shown here how the route offered by dimensional analysis is nothing more than a particular similitude condition among a countable infinite number of alternative possibilities provided by the new theory. The theory of scaling is founded on a metaphysical concept where space is scaled and the mathematical consequences of this are reflected in the governing equations in transport form. The theory is trialled for known problems in continuum mechanics, electromagnetism and heat transfer to illustrate the breath of the approach and additionally demonstrate the advantages offered by additional forms of similitude.},

This research presents a novel approach for automatic and semiautomatic shoe patina growing in the footwear industry using a new co-creative method based on cooperative robotics. The system automates the process in pursuit of operator time-saving without reducing the work finishing quality. For this purpose, the use of a collaborative robot with a built-in constant contact force control and a collaborative tool are used in this research. The use of both tools in complementarity with the knowledge of the craftsman leads the robot end-effector adaptation to the inherent curved surfaces over the shoe. Besides, some orientation corrections are applied based on the CAD model for the task to be accurately accomplished.

In partial load range, speed and torque are controlled via the generator torque but the rotor torque determines the power coefficient of the turbine. High uncertainties for the uncalibrated low-speed shaft torque measurement and varying drivetrain efficiencies which depend on the speed, load and temperature lead to a torque control error that reduces the power coefficient of the wind turbine. In this paper the rotor torque control error and the impact on the power coefficient of wind turbines is quantified. For this purpose, the variation of drivetrain efficiency is analyzed. An efficiency model for the wind turbine drivetrain is build and validated on the test bench. Then, the influence of the drivetrain speed, torque loads, non-torque loads, and temperature on the efficiency is quantified. Finally, the influence of the rotor torque control error on the power coefficient was simulated with an aerodynamic model. The results show that of all examined influences only torque and temperature significantly impacting the efficiency leading to rotor torque control errors that reduce the power coefficient and consequently increase the levelized cost of energy. Improved efficiency measurement on WT test benches or drivetrain efficiency modelling can reduce the rotor torque control error and therefore decrease the LCOE. Die Senkung der Stromgestehungskosten (levelized cost of energy – LCOE) ist das Hauptziel bei der Entwicklung von Windenergieanlagen (WEA). Entsprechend wird die Anlagenregelung dahingehend optimiert, dass eine hohe Energieausbeute und ein hoher Leistungsbeiwert erreicht wird. Hierzu wird im Teillastbereich der Betriebspunkt durch Triebstrangdrehzahl und Drehmoment, über das Gegenmoment am Generator geregelt. Bestimmend für den Leistungsbeiwert ist jedoch der Betriebspunkt (Drehzahl und Drehmoment) am Rotor, der durch den Wirkungsgrad des Triebstranges vom Generatorbetriebspunkt abweicht. Direkte Messungen des Rotordrehmoments weisen hierbei hohe Unsicherheiten durch fehlende Möglichkeiten zur Kalibrierung auf. Auch die Berechnung des Rotordrehmoments aus dem Generatormoment führt auf Grund des variierenden Wirkungsgrades in Abhängigkeit von Drehzahl, Last und Temperatur zu Ungenauigkeiten. Ungenauigkeiten bei der Bestimmung des Rotordrehmomentes verursachen einen Fehler bei der Regelung der Anlage. In diesem Beitrag wird daher der Fehler bei der Bestimmung des Rotordrehmomentes sowie dessen Auswirkung auf den Leistungskoeffizienten von WEA quantifiziert. Zu diesem Zweck werden zunächst die Unsicherheiten bei der Bestimmung des Antriebsstrangwirkungsgrads analysiert. Anschließend wurde ein Wirkungsgradmodell für den Antriebsstrang einer WEA erstellt und auf dem Systemprüfstand validiert. Auf Basis des Modells und der Prüfstandsversuche kann der Einfluss von Drehzahl, Drehmoment, nicht-torsionaler Lasten und Temperatur auf den Wirkungsgrad quantifiziert werden. Abschließend wird der Einfluss des Fehlers in der Regelung der Rotordrehmoments auf den Leistungskoeffizienten mit einem aerodynamischen Modell simuliert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Drehmoment und die Temperatur einen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Wirkungsgrad und damit die Bestimmung des Rotordrehmomentes haben. Der Fehler bei der Drehmomentregelung des Rotors führt dabei zu einer Verringerung des Leistungskoeffizienten und folglich zu einer Erhöhung der LCOE. Verbesserte kalibrierte Wirkungsgradmessungen auf WEA-Systemprüfständen oder eine betriebspunktabhängige Modellierung des Antriebsstrangwirkungsgrads können den Fehler bei der Regelung des Rotordrehmoments verringern und somit die LCOE senken.},

  abstract  = {This study proposes a vehicle localization method that fuses aerial maps and LiDAR measurements in urban canyon environments. The building outlines from an aerial image can be used as appropriate features for matching with the LiDAR data for localization. However, distortions caused by scaled orthographic projection of aerial maps are commonly observed in the images of metropolitan areas, which may significantly degrade the matching and resulting localization performance. In this study, a novel method for correcting such distortions is proposed and used for the vehicle localization by matching the corrected map and LiDAR measurements. Instance and semantic segmentation algorithms were used to distinguish individual buildings and generate corrected outlines of the buildings. A particle filter is applied to determine the pose of the vehicle based on the mutual information between the map and LiDAR measurements. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified using a dataset obtained in urban areas.},

  abstract  = {Cities are drivers of the global economy, containing products and industries that emit many chemicals. Here, we use the Multimedia Urban Model (MUM) to estimate atmospheric emissions and fate of organophosphate esters (OPEs) from 19 global mega or major cities, finding that they collectively emitted  81,000 kg yr^−1 of ∑_10OPEs in 2018. Typically, polar “mobile” compounds tend to partition to and be advected by water, while non-polar “bioaccumulative” chemicals do not. Depending on the built environment and climate of the city considered, the same compound behaves like either a mobile or a bioaccumulative chemical. Cities with large impervious surface areas, such as Kolkata, mobilize even bioaccumulative contaminants to aquatic ecosystems. By contrast, cities with large areas of vegetation fix and transform contaminants, reducing loadings to aquatic ecosystems. Our results therefore suggest that urban design choices could support policies aimed at reducing chemical releases to the broader environment without increasing exposure for urban residents. The authors show how city design and climate both influence the release of chemicals to the world, and suggest that we can help reduce impacts on people and ecosystems by reducing emissions and using green space to trap and degrade chemicals.},

  abstract  = {Transcriptional and translational control are key determinants of gene expression, however, to what extent these two processes can be collectively coordinated is still poorly understood. Here, we use Nanopore long-read sequencing and cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE-seq) to document the landscape of 5′ and 3′ untranslated region (UTR) isoforms and transcription start sites of epidermal stem cells, wild-type keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinomas. Focusing on squamous cell carcinomas, we show that a small cohort of genes with alternative 5′UTR isoforms exhibit overall increased translational efficiencies and are enriched in ribosomal proteins and splicing factors. By combining polysome fractionations and CAGE-seq, we further characterize two of these UTR isoform genes with identical coding sequences and demonstrate that the underlying transcription start site heterogeneity frequently results in 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) motif switches to drive mTORC1-dependent translation of the mRNA. Genome-wide, we show that highly translated squamous cell carcinoma transcripts switch towards increased use of 5′TOP and PRTE motifs, have generally shorter 5′UTRs and expose decreased RNA secondary structures. Notably, we found that the two 5′TOP motif-containing, but not the TOP-less, RPL21 transcript isoforms strongly correlated with overall survival in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Our findings warrant isoform-specific analyses in human cancer datasets and suggest that switching between 5′UTR isoforms is an elegant and simple way to alter protein synthesis rates, set their sensitivity to the mTORC1-dependent nutrient-sensing pathway and direct the translational potential of an mRNA by the precise 5′UTR sequence.},

  abstract  = {Statically indeterminate symmetric (SIS) flexure structures are symmetric structures with “clamped-clamped” boundary conditions. The static indeterminacy and topological symmetry significantly attenuate the parasitic motions associated with statically determinate flexure structures. Hence, SIS flexure structures feature decoupled linear and angular motions, improved motion accuracy, high stiffness, and high stability. Although SIS flexure structures have been more frequently utilized as prismatic joints, they can also be utilized as revolute joints. This study systematically investigates the characteristics of SIS flexure structures. Based on the unified compliance models of a single flexure hinge, analytical compliance models of two fundamental types of SIS flexure structures are established. In 1-degree-of-freedom or planar applications, multiple SIS-based structures can also be integrated into various configurations to transmit linear or angular motions. Corresponding stiffness models are also established. The characteristics and possible applications of the SIS flexure structures are computationally investigated through case studies. Ultimately, several SIS prototypes are manufactured, and the modeling accuracy of the established stiffness models is experimentally verified. 1. SIS flexure structures can reduce parasitic motions and improve motion accuracy. 2. Compliance model of two SIS flexure structure are proposed. 3. Characteristics of SIS flexure structures and potential applications are analyzed.},

  abstract  = {Key message The non-linear seemingly unrelated regression mixed-effects model (NSURMEM) and generalized additive model (GAM) were applied for the first time in crown width (CW) additive models of larch ( Larix gmelinii Rupr.), birch ( Betula platyphylla Suk.), and poplar ( Populus davidiana Dode). The crown radii in four directions (CR) exhibited different growth trends and responded differently to tree size and competition variables. In the absence of calibration, GAM was more accurate than NSURMEM for CR and CW predictions. Context Crown radii in four directions (CR) and crown width (CW) are fundamental indicators used to describe tree crowns. The complexity of the CR growth in four directions of different tree species in natural forests is often ignored. There is logical additivity among CR and CW that is also often overlooked. Furthermore, the existing methods applied to CW additive models have some drawbacks. Aims We aim to: (i) evaluate the utility of two new methods in developing CW additive models for larch ( Larix gmelinii Rupr . ), birch ( Betula platyphylla Suk.), and poplar ( Populus davidiana Dode) in natural secondary forests of Northeastern China; and (ii) explore the growth patterns of CR in four directions to gain important ecological insights. Methods The non-linear seemingly unrelated regression mixed-effects model (NSURMEM) and generalized additive model (GAM) were used to develop CW additive models and to explore crown growth patterns. The predictive ability of the additive models was evaluated using leave-one-plot-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results At a fair level without calibration, GAM provided slightly better results than NSURMEM. The response of the four CR to tree size and competition variables is different and may be non-uniform due to complex stand conditions and tree growth strategies. Conclusion The newly provided methods applied to additive models are available for external datasets. GAM is recommended in the absence of calibration. This study has important implications for the understanding of natural forest dynamics and decision-making for critical stand management.},

  abstract  = {Context Execution logs capture the run-time behavior of software systems. To assist developers in their maintenance tasks, many studies have proposed tools to analyze execution information from logs. However, it is as yet unknown how industry developers use logs in embedded software engineering. Objective In this study, we aim to understand how developers use logs in an embedded software engineering context. Specifically, we would like to gain insights into the type of logs developers analyze, the purposes for which developers analyze logs, the information developers need from logs and their expectation on tool support. Method In order to achieve the aim, we conducted these interview studies. First, we interviewed 25 software developers from ASML, which is a leading company in developing lithography machines. This exploratory case study provides the preliminary findings. Next, we validated and refined our findings by conducting a replication study. We involved 14 interviewees from four companies who have different software engineering roles in their daily work. Results As the result of our first study, we compile a preliminary taxonomy which consists of four types of logs used by developers in practice, 18 purposes of using logs, 13 types of information developers search in logs, 13 challenges faced by developers in log analysis and three suggestions for tool support provided by developers. This taxonomy is refined in the replication study with three additional purposes, one additional information need, four additional challenges and three additional suggestions of tool support. In addition, with these two studies, we observed that text-based editors and self-made scripts are commonly used when it comes to tooling in log analysis practice. As indicated by the interviewees, the development of automatic analysis tools is hindered by the quality of the logs, which further suggests several challenges in log instrumentation and management. Conclusions Based on our study, we provide suggestions for practitioners on logging practices. We provide implications for tool builders on how to further improve tools based on existing techniques. Finally, we suggest some research directions and studies for researchers to further study software logging.},

  abstract  = {The nanometer silica grains that were detected by Cassini in Saturn’s E-ring can be explained by hydrothermal activity on Enceladus’ seafloor and upward transport through the ocean, according to analytical modeling of convection and particle entrainment in Enceladus’ ocean. Observations from Cassini have identified nanometer-sized silica grains in Saturn’s E-ring although their origin is unclear. Tidal deformation within Enceladus’ silicate core has been predicted to generate hot hydrothermal fluids that rise from the core-ocean boundary and traverse the subsurface ocean. This raises the possibility that the particles observed by Cassini could have been produced by hydrothermal alteration and ejected via the south polar plumes. Here, we use an analytical model to quantify potential for particle entrainment in Enceladus’ ocean. We use scaling relations to characterize ocean convection and define a parameter space that enables particle entrainment. We find that both the core-ocean heat fluxes and the transport timescale necessary to drive oceanic convection and entrain particles of the observed sizes are consistent with observations and predictions from existing thermal models. We conclude that hydrothermal alteration at Enceladus’ seafloor could indeed be the source of silica particles in Saturn’s E-ring.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the impact of kernel functions on the accuracy of bi-fidelity Gaussian process regressions (GPR) for engineering applications. The potential of composite kernel learning (CKL) and model selection is also studied, aiming to ease the process of manual kernel selection. Using the autoregressive Gaussian process as the base model, this paper studies four kernel functions and their combinations: Gaussian, Matern-3/2, Matern-5/2, and Cubic. Experiments on four engineering test problems show that the best kernel is problem dependent and sometimes might be counter-intuitive, even when a large amount of low-fidelity data already aids the model. In this regard, using CKL or automatic kernel selection via cross validation and maximum likelihood can reduce the tendency to select a poor-performing kernel. In addition, the CKL technique can create a slightly more accurate model than the best-performing individual kernel. The main drawback of CKL is its significantly expensive computational cost. The results also show that, given a sufficient amount of samples, tuning the regression term is important to improve the accuracy and robustness of bi-fidelity GPR, while decreasing the importance of the proper kernel selection.},

  abstract  = {To investigate the effect of water on the mechanical properties and acoustic emission (AE) characteristics of coal in the failure and deformation processes. Coal samples of different content were subjected to uniaxial compression tests and AE signals were monitored. The characteristics of the AE signals were further analyzed using fractal analysis. The results show that saturated coal samples have substantially reduced mechanical properties such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), dissipation energy, peak stress, and elastic modulus. Under loading, stress–strain curves are characterized by five distinct stages: (1) compaction; (2) linear elastic; (3) crack stable propagation; (4) crack accelerating propagation; and (5) post-peak and residual stages. Using phase-space theory, a novel Grassberger Procaccia (GP) algorithm was utilized to find the AE fractal characteristics of coal samples in different stages. It is significant to note that AE energy does not exhibit fractal characteristics in either the first or second stages. Contrary to the first two stages, the third stage showed obvious fractal characteristics. Fractal analysis of AE time sequences indicates that fractal dimension values change as stress increases, indicating the initiation of complex microcracks in coal. In the fourth stage, the fractal dimension rapidly declines as the strength reaches its limit, indicating the occurrence of macrocracks. However, fractal dimensions continued to decrease further or increased slightly in the fifth stage. Consequently, the coal begins to collapse, potentially resulting in a disaster and failure. It is, therefore, possible to accurately predict coal and rock dynamic failures and microcrack mechanisms by observing the subsequent sudden drop in the correlation dimension of the AE signals in response to different stages of loading.},

Furthermore, most of the works are focused on a very particular place or application and we strive to attain a more general model, resorting to data from different countries. In particular, we compare Great Britain and Israel, two highly different scenarios in terms of vaccination plans and social structure.

  abstract  = {In the model-driven security domain, access control systems provide an application for handling access of persons through controlled gates. A gate, such as a door, can have a lock mechanism for securing the area from unauthorized access. Most commercial solutions for access control management offer pre-packaged software systems where customization of the authorization logic is either not allowed or subject to payment. Moreover, cross-platform development is a barrier for solution providers due to the high cost of development and maintenance that it implies. To overcome these limitations and further optimize the entire access control systems development process, we propose a model-driven approach that supports automatic code generation to enable communication between an IoT infrastructure and platforms for Facility Access Management. Specifically, the approach combines the benefits of Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Tinkerforge (i.e., an open-source hardware platform) with model-driven techniques. This allows the approach to exploit both behavioral and structural models for the modeling and the consequent code generation of part of the authorization mechanism, thus providing complete coverage of the code generated for the whole system. We implemented and evaluated our approach in a real-world case study within the premises of a fitness center with an IoT infrastructure consisting of several heterogeneous sensors by showing its practical applicability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting abstraction and automation concerning traditional code-centric development through code generation features. Consequently, our approach makes the whole development process less time-consuming and error-prone, thus reducing the system’s time to market.},

  abstract  = {Model-driven engineering has been widely applied in software development, aiming to facilitate the coordination among various stakeholders. Such a methodology allows for a more efficient and effective development process. Nevertheless, modeling is a strenuous activity that requires proper knowledge of components, attributes, and logic to reach the level of abstraction required by the application domain. In particular, metamodels play an important role in several paradigms, and specifying wrong entities or attributes in metamodels can negatively impact on the quality of the produced artifacts as well as other elements of the whole process. During the metamodeling phase, modelers can benefit from assistance to avoid mistakes, e.g., getting recommendations like metaclasses and structural features relevant to the metamodel being defined. However, suitable machinery is needed to mine data from repositories of existing modeling artifacts and compute recommendations. In this work, we propose MemoRec, a novel approach that makes use of a collaborative filtering strategy to recommend valuable entities related to the metamodel under construction. Our approach can provide suggestions related to both metaclasses and structured features that should be added in the metamodel under definition. We assess the quality of the work with respect to different metrics, i.e., success rate, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate that MemoRec is capable of suggesting relevant items given a partial metamodel and supporting modelers in their task.},

  abstract  = {Models have evolved from mere pictures supporting human understanding and communication to sophisticated knowledge structures processable by machines and establish value through their processing capabilities. This entails an inevitable need for computer-understandable modeling languages and causes formalization to be a crucial part in the lifecycle of engineering a modeling method. An appropriate formalism must be a means for providing a structural definition to enable a theoretical investigation of conceptual modeling languages and a unique, unambiguous way of specifying the syntax and semantics of an arbitrary modeling language. For this purpose, it must be generic and open to capturing any domain and any functionality. This paper provides a pervasive description of the formalism MetaMorph based on logic and model theory—an approach fulfilling the requirements above for modeling method engineering. The evaluation of the formalism is presented following three streams of work: First, two evaluative case studies illustrate the applicability of MetaMorph formalism concept by concept on the modeling language ProVis from the domain of stochastic education and the well-known Entity-Relationship language. ProVis as well as ER comprise only a few objects and relation types but with high interconnection and expressive power and are therefore considered interesting specimens for formalization. Second, a comprehensive juxtaposition of MetaMorph to three other formalization approaches based on different foundational theories is outlined concept by concept to underpin the formalism design. Third, an empirical evaluation has been performed, assessing the usability and adequacy of the formalism within a classroom assessment. The results allow for conclusions on the completeness, intuitiveness, and complexity as well as on interdependencies with engineers’ skills.},

  abstract  = {There are many repair alternatives for resolving model inconsistencies, each involving one or more model changes. Enumerating them all could overwhelm the developer because the number of possible repairs can grow exponentially. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the immediate cause of an inconsistency. By focusing on the cause, we can generate a repair tree with a subset of repair actions focusing on fixing this cause. This strategy identifies model elements that must be repaired, as opposed to additional model elements that may or may not have to be repaired later. Furthermore, our approach can provide an ownership-based filter for filtering repairs that modify model elements not owned by a developer. This filtering can further reduce the repair possibilities, aiding the developer when choosing repairs to be performed. We evaluated our approach on 24 UML models and four Java systems, using 17 UML consistency rules and 14 Java consistency rules. The evaluation data contained 39,683 inconsistencies, showing our approach’s usability as the repair trees sizes ranged from five to nine on average per model. Also, these repair trees were generated in 0.3 seconds on average, showing our approach’s scalability. Based on the results, we discuss the correctness and minimalism with regard to the cause of the inconsistency. Lastly, we evaluated the filtering mechanism, showing that it is possible to further reduce the number of repairs generated by focusing on ownership.},

  abstract  = {As the complexity of the cyber-physical systems (CPSs) increase, system modeling and simulation tend to be performed on different platforms where collaborative modeling activities are performed on distributed clients, while the simulations of systems are carried out in specific simulation environments, such as high-performance computing (HPC). However, there is a great gap between system models usually designed in system modeling language (SysML) and simulation code, and the existing model transformation-based simulation methods and tools mainly focus on either discrete or continuous models, ignoring the fact that the simulation of hybrid models is quite important in designing complex systems. To this end, a model transformation approach is proposed to simulate hybrid SysML models under a discrete event system specification (DEVS) framework. In this approach, to depict hybrid models, simulation-related meta-models with discrete and continuous features are extracted from SysML views without additional extension. Following the meta object facility (MOF), DEVS meta-models are constructed based on the formal definition of DEVS models, including discrete, hybrid and coupled models. Moreover, a series of concrete mapping rules is defined to transform the discrete and continuous behaviors based on the existing state machine mechanism and constraints of SysML, separately. Such an approach may facilitate a SysML system engineer to use a DEVS-based simulator to validate system models without the necessity of understanding DEVS theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a defense system case.},

  abstract  = {Designing secure and reliable systems is a difficult task. Threat modeling is a process that supports the secure design of systems by easing the understanding of the system’s complexity, as well as identifying and modeling potential threats. These threat models can serve as input for attack simulations, which are used to analyze the behavior of attackers within the system. To ensure the correct functionality of these attack simulations, automated tests are designed that check if an attacker can reach a certain point in the threat model. Currently, there is no way for developers to estimate the degree to which their tests cover the attack simulations and, thus, they cannot determine the quality of their tests. To resolve this shortcoming, we analyze structural testing methods from the software engineering domain and transfer them to the threat modeling domain by following an action design research approach. Further, we develop a first prototype, which is able to assess the test coverage in an automated way and provide a first approach to achieve full coverage. This will enable threat modeler to determine the quality of their tests and, simultaneously, increase the quality of the threat models.},

  abstract  = {Linked to climate change, drivers such as increased temperatures and decreased water availability affect forest health in complex ways by simultaneously weakening tree vitality and promoting insect pest activity. One major beneficiary of climate-induced changes is the European spruce bark beetle ( Ips typographus ). To improve the mechanistic understanding of climate change impacts on long-term beetle infestation risks, individual-based simulation models (IBM) such as the bark beetle dispersion model IPS-SPREADS have been proven as effective tools. However, the computational costs of IBMs limit their spatial scale of application. While these tools are best suitable to simulate bark beetle dynamics on the plot level, upscaling the process to larger areas is challenging. The larger spatial scale is, nevertheless, often required to support the selection of adequate management intervention. Here, we introduce a novel two-step approach to address this challenge: (1) we use the IPS-SPREADS model to simulate the bark beetle dispersal at a local scale by dividing the research area into 250 × 250 m grid cells; and (2) we then apply a metamodel framework to upscale the results to the landscape level. The metamodel is based on Markov chains derived from the infestation probabilities of IPS-SPREADS results and extended by considering neighbor interaction and spruce dieback of each focal cell. We validated the metamodel by comparing its predictions with infestations observed in 2017 and 2018 in the Saxon Switzerland national park, Germany, and tested sanitation felling as a measure to prevent potential further outbreaks in the region. Validation showed an improvement in predictions by introducing the model extension of beetle spreading from one cell to another. The metamodel forecasts indicated an increase in the risk of infestation for adjacent forest areas. In case of a beetle mass outbreak, sanitation felling intensities of 80 percent and above seem to mitigate further outbreak progression.},

  abstract  = {In 2015, an improved version of the misuse case modeling notation designed using the Physics of Notations (PoN) framework was proposed. Empirical data support that the new notation is more cognitively effective than the original notation. The new notation makes use of color, in particular, red and green, meaning that red–green colorblind community will not be able to view the notation as designed and intended. The cognitive effectiveness of the red–green deficient (RGD) version of the new notation in comparison to the original notation is unknown. The PoN outlines a number of principles that can be satisfied with or without the use of color, but would the deficiency of color may be so inhibiting that the cognitive effectiveness superiority of the PoN-enabled misuse case notation becomes diminished? Perhaps the original use case notation would be more cognitively effective for red–green colorblind users. An empirical study using 84 IT (Information Technology) professionals is conducted to assess the cognitive effectiveness of the RGD version of the PoN-enabled misuse case notation in comparison to the original misuse case notation. The experiment data are analyzed for any statistically significant findings. The quantitative and qualitative results of the experiment indicate that the RGD version of PoN-enabled misuse case notation maintains its cognitive effectiveness superiority over the original notation. The results also show that the subjects are divided in their opinions with respect to the aesthetic appeal of the two notations. Adhering to the complete set of principles outlined in the PoN has allowed the new notation to maintain its cognitive effectiveness superiority over the original notation despite a curtailed color perspective.},

  abstract  = {For failure probability analysis of complex structures, the Monte Carlo method (MC) needs a large number of samples and it is more inefficient in the case of small failure probability. Based on the Subset Simulation (SS) and Subset Simulation Significant Sampling (SSIS), this paper analyzes the static and dynamic reliability of main girder of cable-stayed bridge and realizes the efficient solution of the failure probability of complex cable-stayed bridge. According to SS, MC sampling is performed on random variables. Finally, the critical values of intermediate failure events are solved and automatically stratified, and then the failure probability of each failure mode is obtained by counting the number of samples in the failure domain. According to SSIS method, SS method is optimized by introducing important sampling density function, which can make the sample points to fall in the structural failure areas as many as possible. The failure probability of main girder of cable-stayed bridge can be calculated more efficiently. Meanwhile, ANSYS-PDS template technique is used to perform the reliability and sensitivity analysis of main girder of cable-stayed bridge. The failure probabilities obtained are very close to the results of SS. The example analysis shows that for the reliability analysis of cable-stayed bridges, the sample size of SS and SSIS is 0.3},

  abstract  = {The execution context of the cloud composite services is dynamically and rapidly changing. In the cloud environment, the service demands can increase/decrease in a restrained time interval. Due to this fact, cloud composite services have to evolve continuously by scaling up/down their capacity to handle new demands. Scaling up consists in making a component larger or faster to handle a greater load. Scaling down is the reverse of Scaling up and it is the situation of reducing component capacity when the load decreases. Dynamic adaptation mechanisms must be in place to take into account the evolution of the execution context and environment. In this paper, we propose a new Event-B formal model to manage the dynamic reconfiguration of composite services in the cloud context. The proposed approach sets up the required reconfiguration mechanisms and takes into account the coordination between the different cloud computing levels: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The proposed model contains four abstraction levels and implements the scaling mechanisms at each abstraction level. The model consistency has been proved thanks to the Event-B dedicated tools.},

It is shown that the average wave height mainly decreases when sea currents are considered. These changes are insignificant relative to the average values of wave heights. The greatest negative changes are typical for the western, central, and northeast parts of the Black Sea. Here, currents reduce the average annual wave heights down to – 7.5 cm. A slight increase in the average wave height is typical for the southern, southeast parts, and the northwest shelf of the sea. Currents have the greatest influence on the wave parameters during winter and the least during late spring and summer. The validation shows that currents increase the correlation coefficient when wave heights are > 2 m, but this increase is insignificant, over 0.05. In general, the quality of wave simulation in the Black Sea does not improve by supplementing currents in the model used in this study.},

  abstract  = {Several impacts of climate change are becoming evident and will be more and more apparent in the future. The threats and challenges posed by weather patterns variations can change according to the variables of interest, geography, and socio-economic contexts. At the moment, we are compelled to assess their impacts, so as to identify priorities and devise effective countermeasures. A major concern is that of geo-hydrological risks, including the potential effects of landslide evolution in unstable areas. Based on available data on the relationship between soil–atmosphere interaction and mobility of a slow active earthflow in Southern Italy, the paper tries to correlate the expected future precipitation potential evapotranspiration balance and the water level fluctuations that govern landslide mobility. The investigation is carried out in the framework of the bottom-up approach known as decision scaling, which lets us evaluate landslide dynamics sensitivity to the variations in soil water budget by means of a simple abacus. Such a tool will make it possible to obtain fast updates on assessing landslide trends when new generations of climate projections become available.},

  abstract  = {The ambient temperature and the time delay of signal transmission are very important influences on the synchronization behavior of neuronal networks. In this paper, a neuronal network with the power-law degree distribution is constructed using a Hodgkin–Huxley model containing a temperature modulation factor and noise, and neurons at each node of the scale-free network are interconnected by electrical and chemical synapses, respectively. In scale-free networks with different ambient temperatures, the absence of time delay causes the synchronization of networks connected by both synaptic types to increase with coupling strength at lower temperatures, while the opposite is shown for networks connected by chemical synapses at higher temperatures. Networks connected by both synaptic types show multiple synchronization transitions when there is the time delay. Surprisingly, there is a temperature threshold for scale-free networks connected by chemical synapses, beyond which synchronization becomes very poor. By introducing the coefficient of variation and the mean inter-spikes intervals, it is found that the emergence of temperature thresholds for networks connected by chemical synapses is caused by a further increase in the difference in firing frequency of neurons due to increasing temperature. Finally, the generality of the results and mechanisms studied in scale-free networks is verified by investigating the effects of different network scales on synchronization.},

  abstract  = {Building a document-level classifier for COVID-19 on radiology reports could help assist providers in their daily clinical routine, as well as create large numbers of labels for computer vision models. We have developed such a classifier by fine-tuning a BERT-like model initialized from RadBERT, its continuous pre-training on radiology reports that can be used on all radiology-related tasks. RadBERT outperforms all biomedical pre-trainings on this COVID-19 task ( P <0.01) and helps our fine-tuned model achieve an 88.9 macro-averaged F1-score, when evaluated on both X-ray and CT reports. To build this model, we rely on a multi-institutional dataset re-sampled and enriched with concurrent lung diseases, helping the model to resist to distribution shifts. In addition, we explore a variety of fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization techniques that accelerate fine-tuning convergence, stabilize performance, and improve accuracy, especially when data or computational resources are limited. Finally, we provide a set of visualization tools and explainability methods to better understand the performance of the model, and support its practical use in the clinical setting. Our approach offers a ready-to-use COVID-19 classifier and can be applied similarly to other radiology report classification tasks.},

The limit strains at various states of stress were further obtained by Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) experiments, and the fracture limits at different stress triaxialities were determined using the tensile test specimens with various notch sizes. Both of the used damage models predicted the fracture behavior very close to that of the experiments for the left side of the FLD.

  abstract  = {A macro-continuum model of the traffic flow is derived from a micro-car-following model that considers both the upslope and downslope by using the transformation relationship between macro- and micro-variables. The perturbation propagation characteristics and stability conditions of the macroscopic continuum equation are discussed. For uniform flow in the initial equilibrium state, the stability conditions reveal that as the slope angle increased under the action of a small disturbance, the upslope stability increases and downslope stability decreases. Moreover, under a large disturbance, the global stability analysis is carried out by using the wavefront expansion technique for uniform flow in the initial equilibrium state. For the initial nonuniform flow, nonlinear bifurcation analysis such as Hopf bifurcation and saddle–node bifurcation is carried out at the equilibrium point. Subcritical Hopf bifurcation exists when the traffic flow state changes; thus, the limit cycle formed by the Hopf bifurcation is unstable. And the existence condition of saddle-node bifurcation is obtained. Simulation results verify the stability conditions of the model and determine the critical density range. The numerical simulation results show the existence of Hopf bifurcation in phase space, and the spiral saddle point of saddle-node bifurcation varies with the slope angle. Furthermore, the impact of the angle of both the upslope and downslope on the evolution of density waves is investigated.},

In this study, genetic programming (GP), grammatical evolution (GE), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithms are employed to develop a relation in dimensionless form for predicting sediment pick-up rate in open channel flow based on two experimental datasets. Dimensionless Froude number, particle diameter, and depth-averaged turbulent kinetic energy are input variables for prediction. Prediction performance is evaluated with performance indices (root mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of correlation), visual comparisons (scatter, dot, and Bland–Altman plots), and uncertainty indicators (Tsallis and Renyi entropies). Three mathematical expressions for sediment pick-up rate prediction are obtained, with GE producing the most accurate results.},

  abstract  = {Soil moisture is one of the essential climate variables with a potential impact on local climate variability. Despite the importance of soil moisture, studies on soil moisture characteristics in Ethiopia are less documented. In this study, the spatiotemporal variability of Ethiopian soil moisture (SM) has been characterized, and its local and remote influential driving factors are investigated. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and K_Means clustering algorithm have been employed to classify the large domain into homogeneous zones. Complex maximum covariance analysis (CMCA) is applied to evaluate the covariability between SM and selected local and remote variables such as rainfall (RF), evapotranspiration (ET), and sea surface temperature (SST). Inter-comparison among SM datasets highlight that the FLDAS dataset better depicts the country’s SM spatial and temporal distribution (i.e., a correlation coefficient 
$$r=0.95$$
 r = 0.95 , 
$$rmsd=0.04{\mathrm{m}}^{3}{\mathrm{m}}^{-3}$$
 r m s d = 0.04 m 3 m - 3 with observations). Results also indicate that regions located in northeastern Ethiopia are drier irrespective of the season (JJAS, MAM, and OND) considered. In contrast, the western part of the country consistently depicted a wetter condition in all seasons. During summer (JJAS), the soil moisture variability is characterized by a strong east–west spatial contrast. The highest and lowest soil moisture values were observed across the country’s central western and eastern parts, respectively. Furthermore, analyses indicate that interannual variability of SM is dictated substantially by RF, though the impact on some regions is weaker. It is also found that ET likely drives the SM in the eastern part of Ethiopia due to a higher atmospheric moisture demand that ultimately invokes changes in surface humidity and rainfall. A composite analysis based on the extreme five wettest and driest SM years revealed a similar spatial distribution of wet SM with positive anomalies of RF across the country and ET over the southern regions. Remote SSTs are also found to have a significant influence on SM distribution. In particular, equatorial central Pacific and western Indian oceans SST anomalies are predominant factors for spatiotemporal SM variations over the country. Major global oceanic indices: Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Pacific warm pool (PACWARMPOOL), and Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO) are found to be closely associated with the SM anomalies in various parts of the country. The associationship between these remote SST anomalies and local soil moisture is via large-scale atmospheric circulations that are linked to regional factors such as precipitation and temperature anomalies.},

  abstract  = {Aim Major depressive disorder is considered one of the most frequent diseases in the general population, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represents the subset with more significant clinical and social impact. Large, robust phase III studies have shown safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray plus SSRI/SNRI antidepressants (ADs) compared with SSRI/SNRI plus placebo nasal spray in patients with TRD. The main aim of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing esketamine plus ADs with ADs alone in TRD patients, from the societal perspective in Italy. A secondary analysis focused on the National Healthcare Service (NHS) perspective. Methods A Markov multistate model has been developed to estimate quality-adjusted life years and economic outcomes of both treatment strategies over 5 years considering the initiation of esketamine in the different treatment lines, from 3 to 5 (3L–5L). The model has been populated with data from literature and real-world evidence. The analysis from the societal perspective considered direct healthcare costs and patients’ productivity losses. In addition to the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) has been calculated as (incremental benefit × WTP) − incremental cost and by applying a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 50,000€/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses have been performed to assess the robustness of the model results. Results From the societal perspective, the ICUR ranged between 16,314€ and 22,133€ per QALY according to the different treatment lines, while it was over the threshold of 100,000€/QALY for the NHS perspective. The INMB was positive and ranged from 2259€ to 2744€ across treatment lines in the societal perspective; the INMB begins to occur earlier when moving towards subsequent lines of treatment (3.9 years for 3L, 3.6 years for 4L and 3.5 years for 5L). The analyses showed also that the advantage in terms of INMB is maintained for a wide range of societal preferences expressed by WTP thresholds, and in particular for values above 22,200€, 16,400€ and 17,100€ for 3L, 4L and 5L, respectively. Conclusion The study showed that esketamine may be a cost-effective opportunity from the societal perspective for the management of patients with treatment-resistant depression. In the future, data collected from observational studies or registries, which can include the collection of productivity losses and also costs sustained by the patients, will be able to provide further evidence in order to improve the reliability of the model results.},

  abstract  = {Currently, the global situation of COVID-19 is aggravating, pressingly calling for efficient control and prevention measures. Understanding the spreading pattern of COVID-19 has been widely recognized as a vital step for implementing non-pharmaceutical measures. Previous studies explained the differences in contagion rates due to the urban socio-political measures, while fine-grained geographic urban spreading pattern still remains an open issue. Here, we fill this gap by leveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808 anonymous confirmed cases) in nine cities in China. We find a general spreading pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a power-law-like model and the spreading centroid human mobility is time-invariant. Moreover, we reveal that long average traveling distance results in a high growth rate of spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases in the fine-grained geographic model. With such insight, we adopt the Kendall model to simulate the urban spreading of COVID-19 which can well fit the real spreading process. Our results unveil the underlying mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban evolution of COVID-19, and can be used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented by many governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of COVID-19.},

  abstract  = {The state of Campeche, Mexico, harbors one of the largest green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) rookeries of the Wider Caribbean Region. Since the 1970s, harvesting of this population was common practice, but it has since ceased, and the population is rebounding as a consequence. In this rookery, during the past 37 years (1984–2020), the positive relationship between the annual number of nesting females and the number of hatchlings they produce has revealed a long-term population signal that we postulate could be related to environmental factors. To investigate this relationship more deeply, we adopt a stock-recruitment (SR) approach, which is commonly used in fisheries. Regression analysis methods for the SR relationship, including a dynamic version of the model that incorporates the effect of sea surface temperature, show that the number of recruits produced and the number of hatchlings per unit nester were significantly and inversely correlated with a 26-year cycle of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) with a three year lag. A possible explanation for this finding is that environmental conditions during warming periods of the 26-year AMO cycle may negatively affect hatchling production by altering the nest moisture content during the incubation period, and increasing embryonic mortality, while the annual female abundance at nesting beaches may decrease due to trophic effects. The time series of abundance corresponding to other population units of green turtles as well as other species of sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico present a similar behavior to that evaluated here, suggesting a basin-wide environmental effect.},

Like how birds have wings to fly and legs to perch, these bio-inspired aerial robots use independent perching modules. However, modular design not only increases the weight of the robot but also its size, reducing the areas that the robot can access. To mitigate these problems, we take inspiration from gliding and tree-dwelling mammals such as sugar gliders and sloths. We noted how gliding mammals morph their whole limb to transit between flight and perch, and how sloths optimized their physiology to encourage energy-efficient perching. These insights are applied to design a quadrotor robot that transitions between morphologies to fly and perch with a single-direction tendon drive. The robot’s bi-stable arm is rigid in flight but will conform to its target in 0.97 s when perching, holding its grasp with minimal energy use. We achieved a

  abstract  = {This research paper presents a step by step conceptual design and life prediction approach for the design, modeling and simulation of head shaft of a belt bucket elevator, to be used for conveying grains to a height of 33.5 m and at the rate of 200 tons/h. output. For this elevator system, the force and torque acting on the head shaft as well as the bending moment were calculated. Furthermore, the diameter of each cross section of the shaft was determined taking into consideration the geometric and fatigue stress concentration factors, due to shoulders which contribute significantly to most fatigue failures of shafts. The stress induced on the shaft by the force and the factor of safety for each cross section of the shaft was calculated using the DE-Goodman criterion. The model of the shaft was created from the calculated diameters and subjected to static and fatigue analysis using SolidWorks FEA. The results were validated by comparing the values from the FEA and the calculated values for stress and factor of safety of the critical section of the shaft, which showed an equivalent value. The FEA gave a fatigue load factor greater than one, which signifies that the shaft will not go into failure mode within the infinite life cycle of the shaft. The value of the fatigue strength obtained from FEA was higher than the value for the maximum von misses stress of the shaft, this result shows that the head shaft will sustain the loading stresses over a finite life prediction. This research is significant because the stress induced forces on the head shaft from each component of the elevator system were properly identified and analyzed so as to obtain precise results for life prediction.},

  abstract  = {Lack of sufficient and reliable gauged hydrological data over the Red River basin (RRB)—one of the largest river basins in the world, has been a challenge to water resource planning and management in Vietnam. To address this critical issue, this study mainly aimed to apply the VIC hydrological model to simulate surface runoff at the basin scale over the RRB during the period 2005–2014. The surface runoff coefficient estimated from the VIC model output was analyzed in relation to precipitation pattern and watershed factors in three regions (the Northeast, Northwest, and Red River Delta (RRD) region) of the RRB to investigate key factors influencing the spatial and temporal variations of surface runoff coefficients. The results showed that the spatiotemporal variation of surface runoff coefficient was strongly impacted by precipitation pattern, which was indicated by the increased surface runoff coefficients associated with both the increased precipitation amount and precipitation intensity for all regions in the RRB, most obviously in the wet season. In addition, the combined effects of various watershed factors (terrain elevation, land use and land cover, soil type, and soil moisture) in different regions of the RRB also largely contributed to the spatiotemporal variation of surface runoff coefficient. The highest surface runoff coefficients were found in the uppermost areas of the Northeast and Northwest regions and the middle areas of the Northwest region where the high terrain elevations over 1500 m and the dominance of savanna, shrubland, and deciduous broadleaf forest were identified as the key factors contributing to the variation of surface runoff coefficients. These findings could provide a better understanding on the spatial and temporal variations of surface runoff over the RRB toward supporting governmental agencies in making policies and decisions for soil and water resources conservation.},

Finally, the SL-CARMA process has much better fitting to the periodically correlated process in comparison to the retrieved Lévy-driven CARMA models by applying periodic sample from the Apnea-ECG database and the percent log returns of Dow Jones Industrial Average indices by mean absolute error criteria and Diebold–Mariano test.},

  abstract  = {Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation used for improving cognitive functions via delivering weak electrical stimulation with a certain frequency. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of tACS protocols on cognitive functions in healthy young adults. We identified 56 qualified studies that compared cognitive functions between tACS and sham control groups, as indicated by cognitive performances and cognition-related reaction time. Moderator variable analyses specified effect size according to (a) timing of tACS, (b) frequency band of simulation, (c) targeted brain region, and (b) cognitive domain, respectively. Random-effects model meta-analysis revealed small positive effects of tACS protocols on cognitive performances. The moderator variable analyses found significant effects for online-tACS with theta frequency band, online-tACS with gamma frequency band, and offline-tACS with theta frequency band. Moreover, cognitive performances were improved in online- and offline-tACS with theta frequency band on either prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical regions, and further both online- and offline-tACS with theta frequency band enhanced executive function. Online-tACS with gamma frequency band on posterior parietal cortex was effective for improving cognitive performances, and the cognitive improvements appeared in executive function and perceptual-motor function. These findings suggested that tACS protocols with specific timing and frequency band may effectively improve cognitive performances.},

  abstract  = {Since the early 2000s, Model-driven engineering has aimed to accomplish executable UML models. With fUML and PSCS, the Object Management Group (OMG) published standardized specifications of precise semantics for certain parts of UML in the form of metamodels, which form an execution environment. A certain characteristic of these environments is that static information about a model is analyzed and evaluated during runtime. With composite structures being a concept for describing structural properties of a model, the majority of execution semantics specified by PSCS concern analysis and processing of such static information about the model’s fine-grained structure. Thus, the PSCS specification appears suitable for a generative realization approach. Using Model-To-Text-Transformation to generate source code, which serves as an input for the actual execution environment, the runtime level of model executions can be relieved by outsourcing analysis and processing of static information to the level of code generation. By inserting this preprocessing step, the performance of the actual model execution at runtime can be improved. This paper introduces an implementation of the PSCS specification for C++ based on code generation using Model-to-Text-Transformation. This also includes a generative approach to realize an extension mechanism of the fUML and PSCS execution environments by introducing user-defined semantic execution strategies. The proposed PSCS implementation was developed as a part of the MDE4CPP project. Moreover, this paper presents a set of test models validating the correct functionality of the implementation as well as a performance benchmark. Finally, analysis results of an application example for the presented realization are evaluated and discussed.},

By that, we intend to shed light on the mutual benefits of RPA and MDSE and encourage researchers and practitioners to explore the synergies of the two fields.

Traditional approaches often fall short, prompting a shift towards Model-Driven Development (MDD) strategies utilising executable models. Executable models simplify the design process by directly translating high-level, human-readable models into executable code, eliminating manual transcoding errors. However, the challenge of verifying these models in an automated manner remains largely unsolved. The contribution of this paper is a model-driven software engineering methodology utilising logic-labelled finite-state machines (LLFSMs) that enable the automated generation of executable FPGA code from high-level, human-readable models as well as associated Kripke structures for the verification (through model-checking) of high-level executable models running on FPGA platforms. We present a method that utilises the semantics of logic-labelled finite state machines on an FPGA to significantly reduce the size of the created Kripke structures compared with existing LLFSM approaches.},

There’s a growing interest in making Robotic Process Automation more intelligent by embedding richer explicit knowledge in robotic reasoning and User Experience procedural knowledge can become a key enabler for this. The paper reports on a Design Science Research project introducing Knowledge Graphs to connect User Experience processes with contextual resources from enterprise repositories in order to feed procedural bots. This paper addresses a need to manage procedural knowledge pertaining to the User Experience that must be mimicked in RPA projects. It does this by capturing and exploiting semantic links of front-end usage processes across a semantic repository of such processes. This is deployed as a demonstrator that introduces an intermediary navigation layer over an RDF graph persisted from an RPA-focused UX diagrammatic language that operates very close to the business domain. The demonstrator highlights the benefits of a semantic graph view on User Experience and the associated context. It simulates the robotic process of realizing a task where UI elements, external files and programs need to be called during process execution therefore they must be traceable from User Experience steps. Linking the visual appearance of GUI elements and file/data resources as knowledge for procedural execution turns this into a domain-specific process modeling and management approach.},

However, when heterogeneous and independent DSLs are used to define these models, there is a need to explicitly compose their semantics. While the composition of static semantics of DSLs is straightforward, the coordination of their execution semantics is still challenging. This issue is generally called inter-DSL collaboration. In this paper, we propose a formal Model Driven Engineering (MDE) framework built on the Meeduse language workbench that we extend with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Meeduse allows to instrument DSLs with formal semantics using the B method. BPMN provides an easy-to-use notation to define the coordination of execution semantics of these DSLs. A transformation of BPMN models into Communication Sequential Process (CSP) formal language enables the possibility for animation and verification. Our approach is successfully demonstrated by modeling the collaboration of two DSLs from a real case study.},

This paper proposes a holistic approach based on MDE for modeling and formally verifying the high-level architectures of such systems, in particular railway systems. The approach contains a three-step process. The first one consists in proposing a high-level architecture modeling using SysML. It produces graphical models of system components, represents and documents the system in a simple way to be discussed with stakeholders and allows them to verify if this architecture corresponds to their expected requirements. We have selected diagrams that facilitate SysML high-level architecture design, namely package, block-definition, state-transition and sequence diagrams. The second step consists in transforming SysML models to Event-B formal models. The input meta-models are those of SysML, the output one is the Event-B meta-model. All of them have been adapted to our objectives. The last step is the verification of Event-B formal specifications using provers, model-checkers and animators. Formal specifications are specifically recommended for complex critical systems with high level of integrity to verify their correctness, accuracy and to allow a complete check of the entire system states and properties. We illustrate this approach on a case study of emerging standard of the ATO system running over ERTMS where compliance with the normative documents will ensure the achievement of a number of safety objectives while providing a graphical representation understandable by domain experts.},

Through a formal definition of both dimension checking and UoM conversion we are able to categorise the various options with regards to the stage at which they can be undertaken, their useability, and their coverage of potential errors.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing processes in sheet metal forming industry are subject to process-related variations, which can adversely influence the manufacturing costs and the quality of products. For example, during sheet metal forming of car body components, variations in material characteristics of the semi-finished product and in process parameters can lead to variations in the springback behavior of the sheet metal parts and therefore restrict the tolerances that can be realized with sufficient process reliability. In the assembly process, the springback variations of the individual sheet metal parts can also affect the dimensional accuracy of the joined sheet metal assembly and therefore the quality of the car body. In the course of digitizing the process chains in car body manufacturing, one of the objectives is to visualize such springback variations occurring after forming and joining processes of the individual sheet metal parts as well as of the sheet metal assembly at an early stage of development. On the one hand, this allows sheet metal parts and parameters with highest influence on the assembly to be identified and robustly designed, resulting in time and cost savings in hardware phase. On the other hand, tolerances for “less-important” parts of the assembly could be opened up, which may lead to additional cost and time reduction during die manufacturing. Against this background, the present paper provides an approach for modelling the manufacturing process chain of a forming and joining process considering variations in process parameters and material characteristics using finite-element-method and method of metamodeling. Here, metamodeling is used to predict the process behavior and thus reduce the required simulation effort. Based on the metamodels, Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out in order to perform variation and tolerance analysis.},

  abstract  = {Digital phenotyping applications use sensor data from personal digital devices (e.g., smartphones, smart bands) to quantify moment-to-moment human phenotype at the individual in-situ level. Ensuring the quality and distribution of the data used is essential requirement in the domain of these applications. Context Quality (QoC) refers to the Information Quality (QoI) used and the Quality of Service (QoS) level of information distribution. QoI is measured by parameters that define how reliable the information is. On the other hand, QoS is provided by specifying the quality of service for distributing context data. Some aspects can degrade the QoC of the application, such as information from sensors being imprecise, wireless communication technologies used in the acquisition and distribution of information, scalability problems can cause information delay, and intermittent connection due to user mobility can result in data loss. Therefore, this study conceives a process for incorporating QoC requirements and a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to specify these requirements in digital phenotyping applications. A case study was carried out where the scenario of an application for monitoring workers’ health was considered. It was possible to prove the expressiveness and simplicity of the proposed language when using it to define the instances of the application classes responsible for the acquisition and distribution of context information.},

  abstract  = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of closely related software systems which capitalizes on the variability and reusability of the software products and can be formalised by a feature model. Feature model evolution plans (FMEP) capture the current SPL as well as the planned evolution of the SPL to ensure successful long-term development. As business requirements often change, FMEPs should support intermediate update. This modification may cause paradoxes in an FMEP, e.g., a node left without a parent, making the plan impossible to realise. Current tools exist to validate FMEPs, but require analysing the entire plan even when a modification affects only small parts of it. Hence, there is a need for a method that detects such paradoxes in a more efficient way. In this paper, we present an interval based feature model (IBFM), a representation for FMEPs, that allows local reasoning to validates only the parts of the plan affected by changes. We define operations for updating the FMEPs and the preconditions under which they preserve soundness, i.e., absence of paradoxes, and show the correctness of the method.},

In a set of simulation components, either publicly available or from internal repositories, it is difficult for simulation developers to find simulation components that can be reused in a new context. They have to understand the structure and the behaviour of a component to determine, whether it fits for the new context. To address this problem, we introduce our toolchain that allows simulation developers to specify the structure and behaviour of a simulation component. We utilise a state-of-the-art graph database and an SMT theorem prover to compare a simulation components. This allows simulation developers to compare and search for simulation components that can be reused instead of being redeveloped.},

Additionally, since the process of validating the indication system using the proposed complex is inextricably linked with the process of developing onboard software, the software and hardware of the prototyping bench can be used as a technical tool for training the crew to work with the IMF of the aircraft being developed, which further reduces aircraft operating costs.},

  abstract  = {In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), source code can be automatically generated from models such as a class diagram and statecharts. However, even under the assumption that a model is correctly translated into executable code, there is no guarantee that the models correctly capture the user requirements. The validity of a model can be asserted by means of model execution or testing the (prototype) application generated from the model. The completeness of such validation effort can be expressed in terms of model coverage of the executed scenarios. TesCaV is a Model-Based Testing (MBT) tool that provides users feedback by visualizing which test cases have been performed and which ones not yet. This allows TesCaV to be used in an educational setting as its feedback about the manual test cases can be alleviated to let students understand how to adequately test a software system. However, it remains unclear what the best way is to provide this feedback in terms of providing the user maximal information with minimal cognitive load. This research evaluates several proposed visualizations created according to information visualization principles, and makes a ranking based on a questionnaire distributed to 45 participants.},

Specifically, for a domain-specific victim model, the corresponding corpus is used to construct a domain-specific word embedding space, which is utilized as the augmented perturbation space. Besides, we use beam search to augment the search range to further improve the attack ability. Experiment results, involving multiple victim models, datasets, and baselines, reflect that our attack method realized significant improvements on domain-specific model attack.},

Common approaches include Domain-specific languages (DSLs) which provide familiar APIs to domain experts, code generation frameworks that automate the generation of fast and portable code, and runtime systems that manage threads for concurrency and parallelism. In this paper, we present the Halide code generation framework for Phylanx distributed array processing platform. This extension enables compile-time optimization of Phylanx primitives for target architectures. To accomplish this, (1) we implemented new Phylanx primitives using Halide, and (2) partially exported Halide’s thread pool API to carry out parallelism on HPX (Phylanx’s runtime) threads. (3) showcased HPX performance analysis tools made available to Halide applications. The evaluation of the work has been done in two steps. First, we compare the performance of Halide applications running on its native runtime with that of the new HPX backend to verify there is no cost associated with using HPX threads. Next, we compare performances of a number of original implementations of Phylanx primitives against the new ones in Halide to verify performance and portability benefits of Halide in the context of Phylanx.},

Some approaches have met success through the use of template meta-programming in C++. However, their reliance upon C++ makes these approaches inaccessible to non C++ codes. In this paper, we describe a language agnostic methodology using macros that not only mimics the behavior of templates as applied in the abstractions, but also allows the use of code components as building blocks to explore implementation variants.

  abstract  = {Single source of truth (SSOT) is a key element in the realization of digital engineering or model-based system engineering. During today’s aircraft development, huge number of models are built and simulated for different design purposes at different development stages. This brings a crucial challenge for achieving and maintaining model consistency. The single source of truth is a solution to meet model consistency challenge. It emphasizes on building an authoritative data source and all other models shall refer back to it, so that no inconsistent duplicate exists and model consistency is ensured. In this paper, an ontology based single source of truth construction approach is proposed. Ontology is brought out to provide a generic and language-independent description framework for aircraft and SSOT can be built based on this ontology. Then, with the model transformation mechanism introduced, which defines the matching relations between ontology and models, the reference ontology can be transformed into different kinds of aircraft design models and also support the transformation between different models. To confirm the usability of this approach, a practice of this approach on a fix wing unmanned aircraft system (UAS) development is introduced According to the practice, the ontology based single source of truth construction approach initially confirms its feasibility and usability.},

  abstract  = {This study aims at improving the performance of scoring student responses in science education automatically. BERT-based language models have shown significant superiority over traditional NLP models in various language-related tasks. However, science writing of students, including argumentation and explanation, is domain-specific. In addition, the language used by students is different from the language in journals and Wikipedia, which are training sources of BERT and its existing variants. All these suggest that a domain-specific model pre-trained using science education data may improve model performance. However, the ideal type of data to contextualize pre-trained language model and improve the performance in automatically scoring student written responses remains unclear. Therefore, we employ different data in this study to contextualize both BERT and SciBERT models and compare their performance on automatic scoring of assessment tasks for scientific argumentation. We use three datasets to pre-train the model: 1) journal articles in science education, 2) a large dataset of students’ written responses (sample size over 50,000), and 3) a small dataset of students’ written responses of scientific argumentation tasks. Our experimental results show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and responses improve language model performance on a wide variety of downstream tasks. Our study confirms the effectiveness of continual pre-training on domain-specific data in the education domain and demonstrates a generalizable strategy for automating science education tasks with high accuracy. We plan to release our data and SciEdBERT models for public use and community engagement.},

  abstract  = {As the level of autonomous driving (AD) functions advances, various events and problems have occurred in many unexpected or unseen situations. Hence, the design of AD systems requires a validation and verification process to guarantee robust operability. A Simulation-Driven Verification and Validation is based on practical test scenarios in a simulation environment. This approach is a cost-effective way to verify the system requirement at the design level and validate the performance of AD functions at the vehicle testing level by utilizing practical test scenarios in simulation. The practical test scenarios are provided by European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) and they contain harsh conditions. It is also possible to derive numerical values optimized for AD function safety from the simulation results. The performance of AD functions can be robust and enhanced by applying optimized values to the system design. Verification and validation were conducted in a simulation environment through real-field scenarios. Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) - Vulnerable Road User (VRU) test scenarios, representative Euro NCAP test scenarios, were implemented. We created the Euro NCAP AEB-VRU test scenario to design an effective AEB function. We used RoadRunner to build the test road and used ScenarioRunner to render the test scenario written by the Association for Standardization of Automation and Measuring Systems (ASAM) OpenSCENARIO format according to Euro NCAP test requirements. The result of AEB-VRU has been investigated under normal conditions and harsh environments as well. This work shows that we can extend the safety of the AEB function by changing the vehicle speed according to situation perception, which indicates the possibility of utilization of a simulator for autonomous vehicle system design. In addition, suitability assessments of the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) metrics were presented. RSS is a mathematical model proposed by Intel and Mobileye to provide an Automated Driving Safety Framework. One concern for adapting RSS in real road autonomous driving is that the RSS model may provide too conservative safety distances to nearby cars than necessary in real-world driving. As the result of the RSS simulation, the trade-off between safety margin and traffic flow was shown. If the safe distance is excessively secured, the traffic flow may be slower, and it causes inefficiency in vehicle flow. RSS can cause traffic flow disturbances, demonstrating the need for social acceptance when autonomous vehicles become commonly used in real-world environments.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, mapping of application software components’ ontologies semantically emerged as a big research challenge in automotive application domain that manipulates several cross-enterprise synergy knowledge application frameworks. The same knowledge formalized by different experts in different vehicle application frameworks leads to heterogeneous representations of components’ interface data. Consequently, this causes the most daunting impediment in semantic interoperability between the service components in cooperative automotive systems. From a modeling perspective, in the absence of standardized domain-based unified modeling techniques, the orchestration and resolution of semantic data interoperability between various vehicle application frameworks’ components’ interface models remain a challenge. However, this challenge could be addressed using ontological metamodeling by specifying semantic associations between components’ interface model concepts based on the domain knowledge. Apart from the semantic mapping of interface ontological metamodels, this work also defines quality metrics to determine the degree of semantic alignment achieved between the various interface ontologies. Additionally, to reduce development time and cost towards semantic interoperability, this work proposes a semi-automated plugin tool for the applicability of the evaluated quality metrics to semantic mapping of real-world components’ interface models.},

  abstract  = {Despite technological advances, today there are still many treatments that have not been addressed by remote monitoring due to the absence of reliable monitoring devices and/or Health Monitoring Systems (HMS). In addition, there are situations where the deficiency of data due to the lack of a real scenario or device makes it impossible to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, this problem could be solved with simulation, being a fundamental mechanism for predicting and forecasting not-existing scenarios. In this paper, we proposed the use of Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) to model complex HMS scenarios. We have integrated a simulation module based on Matlab Simulink, into the MoSTHealth framework, so that the digital twins (DTs) modelled by the framework are elements of the DES scenario that the medical expert can easily parameterize through a mobile interface. A case study has been defined on the use of a wearable device (under development) that collects relevant hormone levels in real time, during infertility treatment. The DES simulation demonstrates an increase in the number of patients seen by one physician by 88,8},

As a shared-memory parallel programming model, OpenMP has the responsibility of orchestrating the suspension and progression of asynchronous operations occurring on a compute node, such as MPI communications or CUDA/HIP streams. Yet, specifications only come with the task detach(event) API to suspend tasks until an asynchronous operation is completed, which presents a few drawbacks. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of an extension on the taskwait construct to suspend a task until an asynchronous event completion. It aims to reduce runtime costs induced by the current solution, and to provide a standard API to automate portable task suspension solutions. The results show twice less overheads compared to the existing task detach clause.},

However, data collection and analysis of human behaviour are challenging and time-consuming. A potential solution consists in creating digital twins of the individuals to replicate the typical behaviours for advanced data analytics. The Assistive Technology Group (ATG) at Politecnico di Milano has developed NeeMAS (NEEd-based Multi-Agent Simulator), a novel simulator that effectively simulates human behaviour with physiological and social needs, cognitive decay, and behavioural drifts due to ageing or disease onset such as apathy or depression. NeeMAS simulates a senior care facility with several individuals, spending part of their time in their rooms and in part sharing common indoor and outdoor spaces interacting with other people. Experimental results show the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed approach for the generation of typical human behaviours and their drifts.},

Due to the huge amount of used icons, it is of high importance not only to organize the icons into SVG sprites but also to be properly visualized. In this regard, the current article deals with the problem of automation of the process of visualizing the SVG sprites. A three-stage approach based on JavaScript algorithms able to organize and visualize multiple SVG sprites with different numbers of icons is proposed. The conducted tests approve the applicability of the proposed approach for visualizing SVG sprites with different numbers of items.},

  abstract  = {Background: Goal models are usually used during the early phases of requirement elicitation, since they help to understand the motivations underlying the system to be developed. Goal-oriented analysis techniques help analysts reason and make decisions regarding the analyzed goal model. Aims: In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of two goal-oriented analysis techniques: i) VeGAn, which we proposed in a previous work, and which follows a value-driven approach and a fuzzy logic approach and ii) GRL-Quant, which follows a value-neutral approach and a quantitative approach. Method: We conducted an experiment with a population of 64 Computer Science undergraduate students. The participants were asked to analyze a goal model with one of the techniques and to answer a questionnaire to assess their perceptions. The techniques were compared with respect to the accuracy of goal model element prioritization, the participants’ prioritization time, and their perceptions of the quality of the analysis results (perceived satisfaction), ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use. Results: The results of the experiment show that both techniques are very similar since no significant differences could be found in most of the variables analyzed. However, the participants perceived the results of VeGAn more satisfactorily than those of GRL-Quant, although the prioritization accuracy of GRL-Quant was better for one particular system. Conclusions: This paper provides new insights have emerged from this study, and also opportunities to improve both techniques. The experiment provides preliminary results on the usefulness of both goal-oriented analysis techniques, but further research is required in order to strengthen these results.},

Starting from an informal description in natural language, we show how to devise intuitive specifications for such scenario in a formal language. We then make use of a prototype software tool to formally assess whether such specifications would indeed replicate the expected collective behaviour of the colony as a whole.},

  abstract  = {Reliability based analysis of underground tunnel structures is quite important to address the effect of inevitable presence of uncertainties in the rock/soil-mass properties and the resultant loads. The performance function involved in reliability analysis of tunnel are implicit in nature. The brute force Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is the most direct and accurate approach of reliability analysis of such structures. However, it needs enormous time for repeated analysis of tunnels to evaluate the performance function. The surrogate model is quite appealing in such cases to replace the original complex functions to largely reduce the computational time. The Kriging model is highly effective in this regard, due to the interpolation characteristics and its ability to predict the uncertainty of prediction by means of Kriging variance. An efficient adaptive Kriging based MCS method that focuses on the improvement of Kriging prediction by spatial distribution of the sample points is explored. The proposed adaptive method selects the next best point on the basis of maximin distance criterion from the reduced space considering the prediction uncertainties of Kriging model. The application potential of the proposed approach is elucidated by considering reliability analysis of tunnel example problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the approach is studied by comparing the reliability results obtained by the proposed approach with the most accurate reliability estimates obtained by brute force MCS technique.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The possibilities of using model-oriented programming (MOP) for controlling a three-phase bridge transistor converter and converters based on its circuit as parts of electric drives by generating signals with pulse-width modulation are considered. The limitations of the use of the MOP are shown. The modernization of standard modeling tools and model structures is considered to increase functionality and expressiveness, depending on the specifics of the application, as well as for the rational allocation of microcontroller resources and timely updating of information in the management process. An illustration of the application of the research results in the development of a microprocessor control system of an electric drive is given. The expansion of its functionality and improvement of its characteristics are shown. The accessibility of model-oriented programming and modification of standard model tools for specific tasks for electrical engineers, who usually have a limited level of application of microprocessor technology and programming technologies, is emphasized. These materials can serve as a practical guide to model-oriented development.},

A controller tuning method is presented in this paper for enhancing the multi-axis motion performance of these hybrid robots. After modelling analytical expressions of P-PI (P—proportional control, I—integral control) controller parameters considering joint elasticity and the variation of equivalent inertia to motor versus configurations, a controller tuning method with the goal of minimizing the maximum response time difference between each actuated joint in the workspace is proposed. Simulation results on a TriMule-800 hybrid robot show that the trajectory accuracy of the end effector is remarkable improved.},

  abstract  = {Many domains of inquiry in psychology are concerned with rich and complex phenomena. At the same time, the field of psychology is grappling with how to improve research practices to address concerns with the scientific enterprise. In this Perspective, we argue that both of these challenges can be addressed by adopting a principle of methodological variety. According to this principle, developing a variety of methodological tools should be regarded as a scientific goal in itself, one that is critical for advancing scientific theory. To illustrate, we show how the study of language and communication requires varied methodologies, and that theory development proceeds, in part, by integrating disparate tools and designs. We argue that the importance of methodological variation and innovation runs deep, travelling alongside theory development to the core of the scientific enterprise. Finally, we highlight ongoing research agendas that might help to specify, quantify and model methodological variety and its implications. Philosophers of science have identified epistemological criteria for evaluating the promise of a scientific theory. In this Perspective, Dale et al. propose that a principle of methodological variety should be one of these criteria, and argue that psychologists should actively cultivate methodological variety to advance theory.},

Although this type of interconnection has been previously addressed in the literature, during the works to extend the Java Modeling Tools (JMT) for adding PN primitives to existing QN models, we found that a wider range of interpretations of the interconnections between the two formalisms is possible, including cases that cannot be immediately tracked back to states superposition and events synchronization, but that can be easily implemented in discrete event simulation. In this work we present and discuss some of the most interesting scenario identified, with their potential applications.},

In general, these declarative languages are better suited for flexible processes, i.e. processes which lead a lot of open decisions to the model executor and hence have got a relatively large amount of execution paths, whereas imperative languages are mainly used to formalize routine processes. Of course, the question arises whether a declarative or an imperative approach fits better for a specific application. In this paper we handle this issue and present a method based on automata theory, which supports the process modeler in making this decision. Furthermore, we present a comparison method which makes it possible to check given imperative and declarative process models for equality. We finally evaluate our approach by implementing a Java tool and calculating practical examples.},

Also, voices are being raised in favour of machine-consumable legislation and intelligent nudging, in order to increase legislative effectiveness, efficiency and transparency Transparency , thus enhancing compliance at a lower cost thanks to greater simplicity, lower error rate, clarity, accessibility and accountability Accountability . The traditional models of drafting and applying legislation were constructed to be used in a non-digital environment, especially because of the underlying hermeneutics process, although it may be interpreted and transformed in a more automatic and operational way in certain topics such as taxing or social security. Nevertheless, the cost required to understand and comply is often disproportionate comparing with the benefit of compliance. Therefore, there seems to be a language gap between production and consumption of legal rules. A (new) solution for this problem may lie in machine-consumable legislation Machine-consumable legislation , i.e. transforming legal text, concepts and rules (e.g. procedures, requirements and exemptions) into code that can be read, understood and interacted with by specific software. Also (legal) nudging can benefit from a more technological approach, by helping simplifying and making behaviour more automatic in the “right” direction. The digital world is already well aware of the power of nudging. It is time for the law and policy makers to grasp or at least look at similar instruments. The challenge to overcome the legal language and implementation disparity with technology in a digital era, which is still at an embryonic stage, despite its potential, presents several obstacles, from legal conservatism and a tendency towards inertia, to issues of legal certainty and the loss of humanism. Thus, this chapter intends, beyond a survey of the state of the art of rulemaking and nudging as code, to understand how it could work, its advantages and pitfalls, preferential areas of application, caution and limits Limits in its implementation.},

  abstract  = {Method Engineering emerged in the 90s as a discipline to design, construct and adapt methods, techniques and tools for the development of information systems. By executing a method step by step, users follow a systematic and well-defined way to attain the results which the method was created for. To support the creation of methods in a more guided and systematic way, a method framework can be used as a template, allowing one to benefit from the expertise of method engineers who regrouped their good practices in such frameworks. However, the creation and adoption of a method may be difficult if there is no tool to support these activities. In addition, method engineers may not have the programming skills to implement such a tool. In this context, we propose an approach inspired by the low-code paradigm for Method Engineering. The approach helps method engineers in creating new methods or adapting an already existing framework that integrates some construction rules for guidance. Our approach automatically provides tool support so that method experts can actually execute the method. This paper presents the approach through a proof of concept implementation, and a first empirical evaluation through semi-structured interviews.},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, several efforts have been achieved to integrate security in the Software Development Life-cycle (SDL). Analyzing software architecture in order to identify threats is an essential step in secure software development processes. However, performing this task manually can result in identifying false positives. It is thus time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, there is a need for automated tool support to perform this task. Existing efforts are limited to specific, predefined security properties or threats that are checked either manually or using limited toolsets. In this paper, we present a general and constructive model-based approach for threat analysis. We employ domain-specific modeling language techniques to develop a set of modeling languages that enable the specification of the software architecture structure. We used the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for the purposes of precise specification and verification of security threats as properties of a modeled system. To validate our work, we explore a set of representative threats in the context of SCADA systems.},

With the development of unmanned system, the unmanned unit will play an increasingly important role in the process of mission execution. The mission execution mode with the collaboration of different kinds of platforms can form an organic system through mutual support and complementary ability. Therefore, it is necessary to launch the research on the architecture design of multi-platform avionics systems for multi-platform collaboration so as to define the interface pattern among different platforms. Firstly, this paper proposes a multi-platform avionics integration method and architecture drawing lessons from the idea of system integration inside the single platform to support task integration for different missions, system function integration for different capabilities, and system resource integration for different aircraft platforms; Then, this paper proposes a collaborative simulation and verification method based on the scenario design tool and the system modeling tool. By constructing the consistency environment of scenario space–time domain and architecture logic domain, the rationality and accuracy of the simulation model are improved. Finally, the comparative analysis between the multi-platform architecture proposed in this paper and the traditional architecture is realized by analyzing the spatial and temporal data of the collaborative simulation model. The superiority of the proposed multi-platform avionics architecture is verified.},

The majority of prior work on these formal languages focuses on concrete instruction execution and validation tasks. We present a novel Haskell-based modelling approach which allows the creation of flexible and versatile architecture models based on free monads and a custom expression language. Contrary to existing work, our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the representation of memory and register values. This way, we can implement non-concrete software analysis techniques ( e.g. symbolic execution where values are SMT expressions) on top of our model as interpreters for this model. In contrast to prior work, our modelling approach is therefore explicitly focused on the creation of custom ISA interpreters. We employ our outlined approach to create an abstract model and a concrete interpreter for the RISC-V base instruction set. Based on this model, we demonstrate that custom interpreters can be implemented with minimal effort using dynamic information flow tracking as a case study.},

A segmentation based method is proposed in this paper. This network aims to solve the conflict between extracting background features and maintaining small target features. The multi-receptive field and multi-stage fusion network (MRMSNet) components a multi-receptive field module (MRM) and a multi-stage fusion module (MSM). MRM consists of two parts. It first uses multiply cascaded atrous convolution to extract multi-scale features, then exploits post-processing multi-scale features to obtain the background information. According to the characteristics of high-dimensional features and low-dimensional features, MSM performs cascaded fusion to improve the utilization of features. The results show that MRMSNet achieves better performance on SIRST datasets.},

  abstract  = {Event-B is a state-based correct-by-construction system design formal method relying on proof and refinement where system models are expressed using set theory and First Order Logic (FOL). Through the generation and discharging of proof obligations (POs), Event-B natively supports the establishment of properties such as safety invariant, convergence and refinement. Other properties, relevant to system verification, may be studied as well, but need to be explicitly formalised by the designer, or expressed in another formal method. This process compromises reusability and is error-prone, especially on larger systems. Recently, the reflexive EB4EB framework has been proposed for formalising Event-B concepts as first-class objects. It allows manipulating these concepts using FOL and set theory in Event-B. In this paper, we propose a rigorous methodology for extending the EB4EB framework, to support new system analysis mechanisms associated to properties that are not natively present in core Event-B. Thanks to the reflexive nature of this framework, new generic and reusable system properties and their associated POs are expressed once and for all, and for any refinement level. For specific systems, designers instantiate these properties and the associated POs are automatically generated and submitted to Event-B’s provers. This methodology is used to define three analyses: deadlock-freeness, invariant weakness analysis and reachability, all of which are demonstrated on a case study.},

Since there is no direct way to turn complex systems into executable code, various modeling techniques are used to cover different perspectives of a system with models. These models must then be turned into code correctly and consistently. But how to create, structure, and compose the various models throughout the development process? As a formal basis, Reisig proposes net modules, which inherit an associative calculus for composition. Practical modeling is addressed by the work of Fettke and Reisig with the HERAKLIT approach, which adopts especially the net modules as a basis. Based on this, we combined the HERAKLIT approach with our Paose approach and its multi-agent system elements. As our main result we present HERAKLIT Interaction Diagrams which we obtain by enriching HERAKLIT modules by Agent Interaction Diagrams.

  abstract  = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is often referred to as ‘the Third Pole’ and plays an essential role in the global climate. However, it remains challenging for most global and regional models to realistically simulate the characteristics of climate over the TP. In this study, two Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) experiments using spectral nudging with gray-zone (GZ9) and convection-permitting (CP3) resolution are conducted for summers from 2009 to 2018. The surface air temperature (T2m) and precipitation from the two simulations and the global reanalysis ERA5 are evaluated against in-situ observations. The results show that ERA5 has a general cold bias over southern TP, especially in maximum T2m (Tmax), and wet bias over whole TP. Both experiments can successfully capture the spatial pattern and daily variation of T2m and precipitation, though cold bias for temperature and dry bias for precipitation exist especially over the regions south of 35° N. Compared with ERA5, the added value of the two WRF experiments is mainly reflected in the reduced cold bias especially for Tmax with more improvement found in CP3 and the reduced wet bias. However, the ability of the convection-permitting WRF experiment in improving the simulation of precipitation seems limited when compared to the gray-zone WRF experiment, which may be related to the biases in physical parameterization and lack of representativeness of station observation. Further investigation into surface radiation budget reveals that the underestimation of net shortwave radiation contributes a lot to the cold bias of T2m over the southeastern TP in GZ9 which is improved in CP3. Compared with GZ9, CP3 shows that larger specific humidity at low-level (mid-high level) coexists with more precipitation (clouds) over the southern TP. This improvement is achieved by better depiction of topographic details, underlying surface and atmospheric processes, land–atmosphere interactions and so on, leading to stronger northward water vapor transport (WVT) in CP3, providing more water vapor for precipitation at surface and much wetter condition in the mid-high level.},

In our paper we apply the next techniques, we build the architecture of anomaly detection on Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). We use the UML tool sequence diagram by describing the business process of issuing virtual cards. We implement software tools: database, programming language, and datasets. We test the development on mobile technologies (iOS, Android). Our brief finding is concluded by decreasing the number of anomalies in the test case of issuing virtual cards. Our contribution to paper is that we build web services that can effectively solve the problems of big data queries. The novelty is based on our suggestion of application architecture of anomaly detection using a Machine learning module. We apply our architecture model in the process of issuing virtual cards.},

It (1) verifies the user implemented OpenVX applications, partitions them into task graphs and creates their meta-data (2) maps these tasks to physical nodes, creates a schedule, and clusters and places the nodes within a partition-based topology (3) creates the hardware architecture, including additional components required to generate a runtime-adaptive system. These components contain runtime configurable network adapters that can prevent deadlocks, a controller for direct memory access, and a manager that configures both and maintains the schedule. The architecture is designed for applications with high data rates and low synchronization overhead. The evaluation shows a low latency overhead of 0.006},

A conceptual analysis model was constructed by the simplified extraction of the strategic viewpoint, operational viewpoint and resource viewpoint in UAF, which emphasizes the construction of qualitative interdependencies. Then, the Choquet integral preference model with improved solving method was established to tackle the interdependency by quantifying the individual capability and all the sets of capabilities.

Evolving and maturing development tools based on high-level synthesis promise productivity improvements for this technology. However, up to now, FPGA designs for complex simulation workloads, like shallow water simulations based on discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, rely to a large degree on manual application-specific optimizations. In this work, we present a new approach to port shallow water simulations to FPGAs, based on a code-generation framework for high-level abstractions in combination with a template-based stencil processing library that provides FPGA-specific optimizations for a streaming execution model. The new implementation uses a structured grid representation suitable for stencil computations and is compared to an adaptation from an existing hand-optimized FPGA dataflow design supporting unstructured meshes. While there are many differences, for example in the numerical details and problem scalability to be discussed, we demonstrate that overall both approaches can yield meaningful results at competitive performance for the same target FPGA, thus demonstrating a new level of maturity for FPGA-accelerated scientific simulations.},

In this work, we analyze the overcrowding phenomenon considering an ED network, focusing on the so called Ambulance Diversion problem. A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is used to represent the ED network and the Simulation–Based Optimization (SBO) approach is adopted to study a first-aid network under different conditions. The aim is to optimize the performances of the entire network, in order to provide the best service to patients without carrying unsustainable resource costs. A real case study consisting of six big EDs in the Lazio region of Italy has been considered. The achieved results show which are the best diversion policies both in terms of patient waiting time and costs for the service providers. Our implementation of the SBO procedure is based on a novel approach adopted for the communication between the DES model and a Derivative-Free optimization algorithm.},

The flow field was resolved using the transition SST model with highly refined mesh. In the direction of the surface movement, a periodic element from a jet-bank design was chosen. Different nondimensional surface velocities were considered from zero (stationary surface) to two times of inlet jet velocity. It is observed that both the flow field and thermal performance of the jet is strongly affected by the surface motion. The initial symmetric distribution alters when the surface motion increases up to a particular degree of surface velocity, and the average heat transfer decreases. When surface motion exceeds this threshold, net heat transmission increases which leads to the more uniform and enhance heat transfer for high surface velocity cases.},

  abstract  = {Recently a lumped-parameter model of the cardiovascular system was proposed to simulate the hemodynamics response to partial hepatectomy and evaluate the risk of portal hypertension (PHT) due to this surgery. Model parameters are tuned based on each patient data. This work focuses on a global sensitivity analysis (SA) study of such model to better understand the main drivers of the clinical outputs of interest. The analysis suggests which parameters should be considered patient-specific and which can be assumed constant without losing in accuracy in the predictions. While performing the SA, model outputs need to be constrained to physiological ranges. An innovative approach exploits the features of the polynomial chaos expansion method to reduce the overall computational cost. The computed results give new insights on how to improve the calibration of some model parameters. Moreover the final parameter distributions enable the creation of a virtual population available for future works. Although this work is focused on partial hepatectomy, the pipeline can be applied to other cardiovascular hemodynamics models to gain insights for patient-specific parameterization and to define a physiologically relevant virtual population.},

  abstract  = {As Japan’s vision regarding Society 5.0 is unfolding, several digital architectures are (being) designed and constructed. Although Society 5.0 is extensively researched and its application is illustrated in several domains, little research is conducted regarding digital architectures under Society 5.0. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze digital architectures that are (being) designed and constructed under Society 5.0 from an enterprise architecture perspective. Extending the results of related studies, a systematic literature review is conducted to find out which enterprise architecture frameworks and principles are utilized to create digital architectures under Society 5.0. The initial search in three scientific databases resulted in a sample of 857 documents. After removing duplicates and screening based on abstracts, 116 documents have been analyzed. This revealed a variety of 37 digital architectures in different domains. The main finding is that the analyzed digital architectures mainly use conceptual and system representations, make little use of established enterprise architecture frameworks, are not based on explicit principles, and do not refer to a reference architecture for Society 5.0. This paper presents an enterprise architecture perspective on Society 5.0 and is considered of value for scholars and enterprise architects that are interested in digital architectures under Society 5.0. This study is limited to scientific databases and selected published articles. Empirical research is required to validate the findings. As the interest in Society 5.0 is increasing, it is recommended to develop reference architectures and guiding principles to support digital transformation processes. Future research can contribute to develop prescriptive design knowledge and supporting methods for designing, constructing, and evaluating digital architectures under Society 5.0.},

  abstract  = {Increasing industrial resilience is a big challenge for manufacturing enterprises that are continuously facing severe accidents causing injuries, casualties, and economic losses. Assessing industrial resilience requires the analysis of production processes in order to find possible safety flaws. Sociotechnical process management suffers often from misalignments of process descriptions according to formal organization documents or manager views (Work-As-Imagined) and actual work practices as performed by sharp-end operators (Work-As-Done). Furthermore, existing modelling approaches leveraging on techniques such as process mining from digital traces cannot be used to solve such misalignments as these traces are often hardly available. In this context, we propose a computational creativity approach for a semantics-driven transition from Work-As-Imagined to Work-As-Done process models based on the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM). In particular, through formalized semantics, it will be possible to use automatic reasoning for identification of criticalities and prioritization of normal work analyses. To this aim, we introduce some examples of rule patterns, inspired by typical data quality issues, which can be automatically applied to guide such a transition. An explorative case study on chemical cleaning for industrial process is presented to clarify the proposed approach.},

It is shrunk onto the rotor shaft at four essential shrink-fit locations as per the design requirements. The shrink-fit gaps must be optimized during the design cycle to ensure a predefined value of low-cycle fatigue. The use of high-fidelity finite element models to optimize the shrink-fit dimensions is a computationally expensive task, as it requires multiple iterations. In this paper, we use the multivariate distance matrix regression technique to identify dominant predictors (shrink-fit design parameters) associated with the shrink-fit stresses at different locations. Furthermore, identified predictors are then used to estimate a computationally inexpensive surrogate model for predicting stresses in the retaining ring. Our results suggest that the low-fidelity computationally inexpensive surrogate models of different complexities can accurately predict the pattern of the stresses at the chosen shrink-fit locations.},

  abstract  = {Researchers compose scientific workflows for complex scientific experiments and simulations by connecting tools and data in a pipeline. The usability of a scientific workflow management system (SWfMS) largely depends on the availability of necessary tools in the system and the simplicity of their usage. Scientific experiments are incredibly diverse and need a wide variety of tools. Due to an overwhelming number of available tools in the public domain, a SWfMS cannot preinstall all tools required for multifarious experiments. Hence an extensibility mechanism to integrate external tools is greatly important for the flexibility of SWfMS. Tools are independently developed by different development teams using their favorite or suitable programming languages and may run on different operating environments. The tool integration is challenging due to the myriad development languages used for tools and potentially varying operating environments of SWfMS and tools. The software tools may not be robust enough for workflow integration. The state-of-the-art SWfMSs such as Galaxy and KNIME are web-based and can simultaneously serve hundreds of users. The end-users may want to quickly integrate their code in a SWfMS as a tool and use it in a workflow model. But many tools require a system configuration change, which end-users are not authorized to do. The integrated tool must also fit the workflow pipeline with input and output datasets. End-users need an efficient user interface for tool integration by themselves. We created 50 workflows in image processing, bioinformatics, and software analytics domains using VizSciFlow SWfMS. We gathered the challenges we encountered while extending it by integrating tools for these workflows using its extensibility interface. In this paper, we describe the challenges and propose solutions with the help of two case studies we conducted by developing two real-world workflow products - CoGe’s SynMap workflow in the Bioinformatics domain and source code clone detection and validation in the Software Analytics domain.},

The second goal was to find out what methods and techniques Russian lecturers used to help students to overcome difficulties in studying non-linguistic disciplines. And the third goal was to find out respondents’ opinion of a graphic organizer used in the micro- and macroeconomics courses as an instrument of deeper comprehension of the theoretical content. The data was collected from students’ answers to the questionnaire. The study revealed a contradiction between the respondents’ belief in an adequate level of English proficiency and the significant language difficulties they encountered in their studies. Though some students observed improvements in academic skills, others continued experiencing serious problems in the use of English for academic studies. According to the respondents, the instructors helped them better understand disciplinary content. However, the comments demonstrated a limited range of techniques used by lecturers to support them in overcoming language and comprehension problems. A highly positive responses pertaining to the use of a graphic organizer in the economic theory stresses the importance of more diversified and carefully planned instructional support to ensure not only students’ higher academic achievements but also their acquisition of multilingual competences.},

Its concepts represent key aspects of the perceived or conceived world, including particular things (classes and individuals/instances), universal things (classes of classes), and assertions (expression classes) about both kinds of things and relations. Furthermore, ThingFO is placed at the top (foundational) level in the framework of a five-tier ontological architecture. Types of ontologies are placed in this architecture according to the level of generality/specificity. Therefore, depending on the goal and scope of a developed ontology, it can be placed in the architecture at the foundational, core, top-domain, low-domain, or instance layer. ThingFO is the single ontology at the top level, so ontologies at lower levels must reuse and specialize its concepts and relationships to ensure harmonization and interoperability. To show the applicability of ThingFO, this paper analyzes enriched concepts and specialized relationships for two core ontologies, particularly, for situation and process ontologies, where their concepts are in turn reused and extended by domain ontologies.},

  abstract  = {Automated rule checking (ARC), which is expected to promote the efficiency of the compliance checking process in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, is gaining increasing attention. Throwing light on the ARC application hotspots and forecasting its trends are useful to the related research and drive innovations. Therefore, this study takes the patents from the database of the Derwent Innovations Index database (DII) and China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) as data sources and then carried out a three-step analysis including (1) quantitative characteristics (i.e., annual distribution analysis) of patents, (2) identification of ARC topics using a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and, (3) SNA-based co-occurrence analysis of ARC topics. The results show that the research hotspots and trends of Chinese and English patents are different. The contributions of this study have three aspects: (1) an approach to a comprehensive analysis of patents by integrating multiple text mining methods (i.e., SNA and LDA) is introduced; (2) the application hotspots and development trends of ARC are reviewed based on patent analysis; and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of ARC is provided.},

  abstract  = {Construction progress tracking and monitoring is a complex process, crucial for the smooth execution of projects and delivery of a high-quality product to the client. However, these tasks remain primarily manual, time-consuming and error prone, and can lead to cost and time overruns. The objective of the present research is to develop a system based on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) point clouds and Internet of Things (IoT) integrated with Building Information Modelling (BIM) to track the construction progress and to allow project managers to make informed decisions based upon reliable feedback. This paper has three parts: (1) the development of a new, more precise classification of the technologies and data used in the progress monitoring process, categorising them as support, data collection or data processing technologies; (2) the proposition of a framework for automated data collection and information treatment, offering a holistic solution for progress tracking and monitoring; (3) the presentation of a pilot-project partially implementing the proposed framework using BIM, SLAM, beacon technology and an automated rover in a real context. Several data acquisitions on construction sites were used to assess the capacity of the system for real-time reconstruction and progress tracking. This automized method is compared to the traditional manual capture of progress tracking. The results are discussed, and future work is identified.},

Applications for CPS need to reason about the end of execution to verify the reclamation/release of physical resources, so our temporal logic is stated on finite traces. Lastly, Shelley infers the behavior from code using an inter-procedural and compositional analysis, thus supporting the usual object-oriented programming techniques employed in MicroPython code.

Based on the grey incremental model GM (1,1) method, this paper uses the population data from 2000 to 2022 to construct a population prediction model for Huizhou and predict the population in the next 15 years. The prediction results show that the urban population of Huizhou will still increase year by year from 2023 to 2037, which will have an impact on the sustainable development of the city. Finally, the countermeasures for population development in Huizhou are proposed for regional development.},

In this paper, we describe a method to accelerate tensor algebra a different way: by outsourcing operations to an optical microchip. We outline a numerical programming language developed to perform tensor algebra computations that is designed to leverage our optical hardware’s full potential. We introduce the language’s current grammar and go over the compiler design. We then show a new way to store sparse rank- n tensors in RAM that outperforms conventional array storage (used by C++, Java, etc.). This method is more memory-efficient than Compressed Sparse Fiber (CSF) format and is specifically tuned for our optical hardware. Finally, we show how the scalar-tensor product, rank- n Kronecker product, tensor dot product, Khatri-Rao product, face-splitting product, and vector cross product can be compiled into operations native to our optical microchip through various tensor decompositions.},

  abstract  = {Mastering Material Handling Systems is a crucial issue for numerous companies since the costs of material handling activities are far from being negligible. The demand for a sustainable industry and the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies for material handling are renewing the Material Handling System design concerns. Many questions arise on whether it is suitable or not to bring technologies such as Autonomous Mobile Robots or Real-Time Location Systems to the shop floors. In the presented study, various companies are questioned on their utilization of new technologies and on their processes to manage and modify their Material Handling System. It appears that practices in Material Handling System design and management are diversified and that no consensus exists on how to efficiently design these systems. A cross-analysis is performed to identify the differences and the common patterns between the literature and the field study. This work discusses the need to better understand the relation between the different aspects of Material Handling System design and presents key challenges to be addressed in the context of Industry 4.0. To address these challenges, research directions are proposed. They are composed of four main challenges area: Material Handling specifications, Material Handling Equipment selection, Material Handling Equipment deployment, and Material Handling System analysis.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {The performance of rockfall barriers have been traditionally assessed using standardized impact tests such as SEL and MEL (EOTA 2018 ); that quantify the barrier service and maximum energy levels, respectively. Unfortunately, these types of tests only provide information for very specific loading conditions, i.e. centered impacts, that fail to consider the way different loading conditions affect the barrier response. It has been shown that, given a certain block kinetic force, changes in the block size (Buzzi and Krummenacher 2014 ) and impact position (Zhao et al. 2020 ), can make the difference between withstand and failure. In recent years, numerical approaches such as Finite (FEM, Gentilini et al. 2013 ) and Discrete (DEM, Bertrand et al. 2012 ) Element Method have been used to overcome these limitations and investigate more complex loading conditions (Song et al. 2018 ). However, this type of analysis is still mostly limited to research institutions and universities as it requires a certain degree of computational power and technical expertise, which might not be available to the end user (i.e. engineering firms). Metamodels, also known as surrogate models, are a type of high-level models that aim to approximate the behavior of lower-level, higher fidelity models, reducing the computational burden. They have shown promising results in the scope of rockfall protection, where they have been used to predict failure modes under different loading conditions (Mentani et al. 2016 ; Toe et al. 2018 ). In this paper, we combine the efficiency of a meta-model built using a DEM barrier model with the predictive abilities of the block propagation code Hy-Stone (Lanfranconi et al. 2020 ) to provide site-specific results with increased computational efficiency and ease of use compared to the standard numerical approaches.},

Results for Power Coefficient (Cp) agreed with data from the literature and were associated with corresponding GRV and Co* values.

The study subject is the apparatus for information and analytical support for decision-making on the resource support of operations. It was concluded that the reason for the low indicators of the public protection values from fires in Russia and Kazakhstan is determined by the irrational resources provision for fire departments. The studies relevance aimed at the efficiency increasing of the Fire Fighting units’ resource supply is justified. An overview of research in the subject area has been made. The basic approach to solving the problem has been determined, which is based on the integrated use of the FTA method and the system approach with MSS system locations. The concept of “Area of acceptable values” has been offered. A computational procedure for calculating nodes and the root of the failure tree of the emergency response operation has been developed. The criteria system of the efficiency, reliability and quality of the operation plan has been developed, allowing to compare the solutions to the identified problems of non-compliance of the state of resources with the required one. The significant impact of the Arrival Time at Call Location factor on the Fire Fighting operation success is shown. The process choice for the practical implementation of theoretical studies is justified. The nodes and the root of the tree have been calculated. Solutions with the same reliability test values and different quality test values have been demonstrated.

In this paper, based on the existing powertrain design, a matching method for the power battery for an FSEC race car is proposed. The key parameters of the power battery are calculated and matched using this method. At last, a simulation model of the race car was built using Simulink and CarSim, and it was used to evaluate the performance and range of the race car.

Current research in this field focuses on algorithms to learn intervention policies that maximize the expected payoff of the interventions under certain statistical assumptions. In contrast, there has been limited attention on how to aid process stakeholders in understanding the outputs of these algorithms. In this research, we set to develop an interface to provide end users with relevant information to guide the decision on where and when to trigger interventions in a process. We draw upon an analysis of existing solutions and a review of the literature to elicit information items for a user interface for prescriptive process monitoring. Thereon, we develop a user interface concept and evaluate it with experts. The evaluation confirms the informational needs covered by the user interface concept. In addition, the evaluation shows that different end-user groups (operational users, tactical managers, and process analysts) can benefit from the information items included in the interface.},

  year      = {2023},
  month     = {jan},
  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is an approach that employs MRI to monitor changes in blood flow and tissue perfusion following the injection of a contrast agent. DCE-MRI may be used to calculate PharmacoKinetic (PK) maps and disclose specifics about the manner in which the body distributes and eliminates medications. These maps can be employed to improve drug dosage and treatment planning, as well as to comprehend the pharmacokinetics of medicines in various tissues. To improve the speed and accuracy of PK map estimation, a dictionary-based Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach based on the Tofts model has been proposed. The Tofts model is a widely used PK model that describes the transport and metabolism of a contrast agent in tissue. The dictionary-based PLS approach utilizes a pre-constructed dictionary of Tofts model parameters, which can be used to speed up the PK map estimation process. Instead of fitting the Tofts model to the DCE-MRI data from scratch, the algorithm uses the pre-constructed dictionary to identify the most likely set of parameters that best fit the data. This can significantly reduce the computational time required for PK map estimation, making it more practical for clinical use. These techniques were assessed using simulation model. The results show the PLS approach was able to estimate PK maps accurately for simulated. The low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) suggests that error will fall within the permissible range of tolerance. The computational time for the PLS approach was found to be significantly less than TM-TD and TM-FD approaches. As a result, the proposed TM-PLS approach, which is based on Tofts model, exhibits promising performance in terms of computational time, and errors that are moderately higher than the traditional curve fitting model for the determination of PK maps in DCE-MRI, which is a crucial parameter for the diagnosis and treatment planning.},

The number of vehicles on the road is increasing day by day at a rapid pace. So, most people are facing traffic jam issues across the country and worldwide. People are also facing the same issue of congestion while refilling the fuel at service stations. They need to be in queue for an undefined amount of time. They are not sure about how much time is required to refill the vehicle fuel tank. Even, they are not having idea of whether they will get chance to refill the tank or not. We understood the problem and produced a solution which will provide users with the tentative required time, service pump number. This tentative time will give an idea to the user about how much approximate time is required to refill the tank. User can go to specific assigned service pump as per his/her vehicle fuel type. Using this approach, users need not to be in the queue and wait for their turn. Our developed system is responsible to form virtual queue in system once system received refill entry from the user and assign best possible fuel pump and calculate tentative required time. If the user needs urgent service, then they can opt for service. Our system is enough to provide services across all part of world without any additional cost.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated the transformation of various traditional systems into a more convenient form of interaction and integration among people, machines, and things. In industry, there exists a significant class of process-oriented information systems, known as Process-aware Information Systems (PAIS), which are supported by business process management (BPM). The aim of business processes is to provide programming paradigms and business logic for IoT, while IoT can facilitate the quick and accurate capture of physical world changes by business processes, enabling them to respond in a timely manner. The heterogeneity in data and protocols among IoT physical entities, along with the continuous nature of their data, poses a challenge for traditional PAIS. These systems lack strict temporal semantics, and their business process event interaction mechanisms only apply to discrete events, making it difficult to efficiently handle continuous events. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new IoT service model that has the capability to handle and respond to continuous IoT events, and enable the service to be bound to an executable element in a business process. By doing so, the IoT service can become one of the basic programming components for PAIS to respond promptly to changes in the physical world. The proposed model has been validated through case studies and experimental research, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Within classical MAPE-K control-loop structures for adaptive systems, knowledge gathered from monitoring the system and its environment is used to guide adaptation decisions at runtime. There are several approaches to enrich this knowledge base to improve the planning of adaptations. We consider a method where probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used at design time to compute results for various short-term objectives, such as the expected energy consumption, expected throughput, or probability of success. The variety PMC-results yield the basis for defining decision policies (PMC-based strategies) that operate at runtime and serve as heuristics to optimize for a given long-term objective. The main goal is to apply a robust decision making method that can deal with different kinds of uncertainty at runtime. In this paper, we thoroughly examine, quantify, and evaluate the potential of this approach with the help of an experimental study on an adaptive hardware platform, where the global objective addresses the trade-off between energy consumption and performance. The focus of this study is on the robustness of PMC-based strategies and their ability to dynamically manage situations, where the system at runtime operates under conditions that deviate from the (idealized) assumptions made in the preceding offline analysis.},

This paper presents a novel control of the actuated-SLIP hopping on unknown terrains. We propose that in the neighborhood of the desired stable hybrid limit cycle, the local dynamical behavior of a hybrid system can be expressed by a set of phase coordinates and transverse coordinates. Under some acceptable assumptions, the hybrid averaging theorem is applied on the SLIP non-integrable dynamics to simplify the controller design. Using the inherent symmetry of SLIP dynamics, a control Lyapunov function-based hybrid averaging controller is developed to ensure the exponential stability of the desired gait orbit. This results in a set of linear constraints on the control signal, which can be readily solved by a quadratic programming optimization. Furthermore, a novel method is introduced to improve the robustness against unknown disturbances through the online constraint adjustment. The proposed controller is evaluated in various simulations, demonstrating the SLIP hopping on diverse terrains, including flat, sin-wave, and unregular terrains. The performance of the approach is also validated on a quadruped robot SCIT Dog for generating dynamic gaits such as pronking.},

In this paper, we formalize the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety model (RSS) for self-driving cars and prove the safety and optimality of this model in the longitudinal direction. We utilize the hybrid systems theorem prover KeYmaera X to formalize RSS as a hybrid system with its nondeterministic control choices and continuous motion model, and prove absence of collisions. We then illustrate the practicality of RSS through refinement proofs that turn the verified nondeterministic control envelopes into deterministic ones and further verified compilation to Python. The refinement and compilation are safety-preserving; as a result, safety proofs of the formal model transfer to the compiled code, while counterexamples discovered in testing the code of an unverified model transfer back. The resulting Python code allows to test the behavior of cars following the motion model of RSS in simulation, to measure agreement between the model and simulation with monitors that are derived from the formal model, and to report counterexamples from simulation back to the formal model.},

  abstract  = {Strategic Supply Chain Capacity Planning (SSCCP) is an essential activity for companies to prepare their future. However, since uncertainty became an essential factor to consider in this decision-making process, existing solutions to support this process do not fully satisfy their needs anymore. Especially in terms of uncertainty space coverage while exploring and assessing scenarios associated with uncertainty sources and decision options. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach to overcome the complexity of scenario exploration and improve the uncertainty space coverage, to better support SSCCP decision-making. This approach includes a bi-objective metaheuristic that first explores a probability-impact matrix to define a relevant subspace to consider in this uncertainty space, and then uses this subspace to explore the decision space and define a relevant subspace of this decision space to assess and display to decision-makers. Then, an implementation and experiment are described and discussed, and finally avenues for future research are suggested.},

A deep learning-based surrogate model is developed and integrated with Jaya optimization algorithm to enhance the computational efficiency and accuracy of the inverse analysis. The input variables for the training set of the surrogate model are generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The output variables are obtained based on a high-precision finite element model calculation. By comparing the model accuracy and computation time across different sample sizes (ranges from 20 to 200 times the number of input variables), the optimal sample size is identified. The study was conducted for the case study of an actual high arch dam in China for which measured data are available. The results indicate that a sample size of 100 times the number of input variables achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and computation time.},

  abstract  = {The application of evolutionary algorithms in continuous optimization is a well-studied area of research. Nevertheless, recently there have been numerous works associated with surrogate-assisted approaches. This paper introduces LQ-R-SHADE: R-SHADE extended with a quadratic surrogate model. The principles of LQ-R-SHADE and its enhancements over the base R-SHADE are discussed in detail. The extension consists of the three main components: an archive of samples, a prescreening meta-model, and an initialization supported by the meta-model. In order to take advantage of the meta-model utilization as early as possible, a cascade of models is proposed: linear, quadratic, and quadratic with interactions. The proposed algorithm relies on multiple generation of mutated versions of each individual. The prescreening meta-model is then applied to select the most promising candidates for further evaluation with the use of a (costly) true fitness function. The performance of LQ-R-SHADE is evaluated on the well-known COCO BBOB benchmark and compared with the baseline R-SHADE method and its extension SHADE-LM, showing the advantage of the proposed algorithm. Besides numerical assessment, the impact of particular meta-model components on the obtained results is examined.},

Corresponding to these advancements, it was felt necessary that a geostatistical modelling study needed a proper connection between geology and geostatistics. The manner of integrating geology with geostatistics can be accomplished by carrying out geostatistical modelling in combination with geology of deposit, mineralisation controls, and zonation of the deposit into several geological ‘domains’. An adequate understanding of deposit geology is, thus, an essential pre-requisite to a geostatistical modelling study. It goes without saying that geology controls the distribution of geologically complex grades, hence it is crucial that geology direct estimation modelling rather than estimation modelling direct geology. An improved understanding of type and characteristics of mineralization is achieved only through a suitable integration of deposit geology with relevant geostatistical technique(s).},

Furthermore, the paper proposes some reasonable and feasible suggestions for its innovative development from the perspective of internal innovation. Most of the current studies focus on adopting “cultural industries +” model to achieve innovation, such as cultural Industries + tourism, cultural industries + finance, cultural industries + high technology, and so on, relatively few of them make profound study on the internal innovation of the cultural industries. Based on the theories of strategy and innovation, this paper suggests expanding boundaries of Macao’s cultural industries through internal strategic innovation, which include expending industry classification standards, expanding the value chain, expanding the scope of regional cooperation.},

  abstract  = {Uncoordinated decisions that have a long-term impact on the production network lead to inefficient structures and limit the ability to change. However, the ability to change is a basic prerequisite for future decisions. At the same time, the world is becoming more volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambivalent. To counteract this, external and internal influencing factors must be considered in the early stages of planning global production networks (GPN). The design of GPN is on the one hand associated with a large number of degrees of freedom and on the other hand with a large number of influencing factors. Influencing factors can thereby be known and predictable, but also unknown and unpredictable. To make production networks capable to change in the long term, influencing factors and their effect on the network design must be considered. The combination of influencing factors with consideration of uncertainty still needs further research in the context of network design. Thus, this article aims to develop a method for network design that does not only take external and internal influences into account at an early stage but also leads to a network configuration that considers these influences and increases resilience. To achieve this, the influencing factors should first be represented in scenarios using the receptor theory. Subsequently, the scenarios can be incorporated into the optimization of the network configuration by choosing a solution from a predefined solution space. The process of solution selection and testing can be supported by a digital twin. The result is an initial concept that merges these different steps into a continuous process that can be used to design adaptable GPN in the future.},

As a result, an increasing knowledge gap emerges. This paper proposes the QuantumShare ontology to capture and share quantum computing knowledge to support the collaboration between quantum experts and non-expert adopters, thereby bridging the present knowledge gap.

It can be concluded that the develop a virtual lab that allows students to actively join in and experience the whole experiment process better help students master related knowledge and skills.

The chief cause of TB is bacterial complex of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Subsequently, evolution of totally drug resistant (TDR) strains of also creates a serious health challenge leading to the need of discovering new drugs for the treatment of TB with novel mechanisms of action. From ancient times natural remedies originating from both plants and microbes are being used as potent sources of antimicrobial remedies. These natural products are rich in chemical diversity and such remedies are being validated through centuries of evolution. Therefore, present study includes in silico screening of the potent ligands from Adhatoda vasica Nees, belonging to the family Acanthaceae, a well-known plant-based drug extensively used in the Ayurvedic and Unani medicine system in India for more than 2000 years. In this study 39 molecules of A. vasica are docked against the target protein Glutamine synthatase. Out of which 25 favorable conformations were selected. Only 12 molecules could pass the Lipinski’s filter. Further analysis of the ligand receptor compound suggested five potential biomolecules, viz., 3-hydroxyanisotine, Vasnetine, Apigenin, 2-naphthalenemethanol and l-vasicinone are to be considered as potent candidates for in vitro and in vivo tests against the target protein.},

While vision-based approaches to gesture recognition rightly focus on detecting hand poses in a single frame of video, there is less focus on recognizing the distinct “phases” of gesture as used in real interaction between humans or between humans and computers. Following the semantics of gesture originally outlined by Kendon, and elaborated by many such as McNeill and Lascarides and Stone, we propose a method to automatically detect the preparatory, “stroke,” and recovery phases of semantic gestures. This method can be used to mitigate errors in automatic motion recognition, such as when the hand pose of a gesture is formed before semantic content is intended to be communicated and in semi-automatically creating or augmenting large gesture-speech alignment corpora.},

  abstract  = {IT infrastructures break. Whether it be computer attacks or software, human or hardware failures, IT safety and security risk is present in many technical and organizational domains. Risk management is therefore essential to ensure infrastructure resilience, compliance with legal and contractual requirements and a better knowledge of what causes what. But risk management is hard to automate, sometimes because criteria are subject to human appreciation, sometimes because of an incomplete or wrong knowledge of the infrastructure itself. And this latter factor has become more evident with the advent of modern cloud-native architectures: complex and dynamic infrastructures make risk assessment difficult. In this article, we propose an approach based on infrastructure modeling to help automate the risk assessment process for IT infrastructures. Instead of focusing first on hazard analysis, our approach attempts to consider (most of) such an analysis as a consequence of infrastructure modeling. By deciding to focus on the infrastructure modeling itself and by involving as many of the company’s stakeholders as possible in the process, we intend to make risk assessment more collaborative and thorough, by taking advantage of everyone’s expertise.},

  abstract  = {Advances in computational technology have enabled engineers to obtain large amounts of data efficiently. However, generating datasets from a single source is still burdensome and inefficient, so there have been many studies on data fusion techniques using multiple sources of data: e.g., low-fidelity data from computational fluid dynamics simulations and high-fidelity data from wind tunnel experiments. The hierarchical Kriging surrogate model is one of these data fusion methods which is known to be simple, robust, and accurate. It is based on the Kriging surrogate model, which predicts quantities of interest using an accumulated database based on the interpolation method. However, serious problems arise when it is built based on the noisy datasets for the following reasons: 1) noise in the dataset induces ill-conditioned correlation matrix; and 2) errors at lower-fidelity levels due to the noise accumulate as the fidelity level increases, adversely affecting the accuracy of the final model. These issues can be mitigated by a method called regression-based Kriging, which incorporates the adaptive regression factor (nugget) to the correlation matrix. This paper extends the corresponding regression technique to the hierarchical Kriging surrogate model, which will be called regression-based hierarchical Kriging. Considering that data fusion methods synthesize data with different fidelity levels to build a surrogate model efficiently, the regression-based hierarchical Kriging model can consider the different degrees of noise at each fidelity level. Herein, this model is demonstrated with several numerical examples with artificial noise and is finally validated with real engineering problem. These examples show that the proposed method has better performance than interpolation-based hierarchical Kriging when trained with the noisy data.},

One promising area of technology involves morphing blades. Specifically, active transformation of the blade twist angle has been shown to improve aerodynamic performance. The performance of this capability is being studied through computer modeling and experimental work. To advance this technology, data is needed to build a data-driven model that will enable design and control. The work in this paper examines different model and experimental data. Techniques for evaluating data are presented as well. Comparisons are made between the experimental data, low-fidelity BEM modeling, and high-fidelity CFD modeling work to evaluate the comparative benefits of each modeling method. A Buckingham’s Pi theorem scaling approach is shown to illustrate the connection between the models and full-scale turbines. Also presented is a procedure to examine the accuracy of the data. Determined experimental uncertainty is thus included in the models presented. The overarching goal is to develop a framework that combines decision-based data curation with data-driven modeling to support design and control of adaptive aerostructures.},

NoSQL database popularity has increased due to its flexible schema, easy query interface, and scalability to handle such heterogeneous data. Document oriented NoSQLs are more popular to handle such heterogeneous data with flexible schema and a semi-structured data model. A flexible schema facilitates multiple ways to represent different types of variability that exist in the data collection. However, the impact of choosing different data representations on storage, energy, and performance is unknown. On the other hand, analysing the scope of optimising storage and energy efficiency is recommended for sustainable development. This paper discusses key components of the document store schema, its alternate implementations, and empirically analyse its impact on performance, storage space, and energy requirements. The aim of this paper is to assist developers in choosing an appropriate representation of each schema component for their application in the document stores.

We take this problem to a novel combination of the Fault and Attack Trees (FATs) as Feared Events-Properties Trees (FEPTs) and propose an approach for analyzing safety and security interactions considering a multi-level model. The multi-level model facilitates identifying safety- and security-related feared events and associated properties across different system representation levels, viz. system, sub-system, information, and component. Likewise, FEPT allows modeling and analyzing the inter-dependencies between the feared events and properties and their propagation across these levels. We illustrate the use of this approach in a simple and realistic case of trajectory planning in an intersection point scenario regarding autonomous Connected-Driving Vehicles (CDVs) to address the potential interactions between safety and security.},

The Intersection over Union (IoU) metric is improved to converge faster, to make the surface of the loss function smooth and continuous over the whole searched space, and to reach a more precise approximation of the labels. The main principle is adding a smoothing part to the original IoU, where the smoothing part is given by a linear space with values that increases from the ground truth bounding box to the border of the input image, and thus covers the whole spatial search space. We show the motivation and formalism behind this loss function and experimentally prove that it outperforms IoU, DIoU, CIoU, and SIoU by a large margin. We experimentally show that the proposed loss function is robust with respect to the noise in the dimension of ground truth bounding boxes.

Data and technology utilization without a focus on individuals may lead to disregard for human dignity. This paper introduces a design principle for person-centered care services that prioritizes individual well-being on the basis of patient life backgrounds. We extracted problematic care behaviors with 6 typical categories, employed the person-centered care principle to design a co-creation workshop, and qualitatively evaluated the effectiveness of the workshop with care workers. A qualitative analysis using the Grounded Theory Approach revealed the effectiveness of visualization and shared viewpoints in the workshop design; however, we found that the design should be improved so that participants could deeply empathize with the recipients. We also extracted the 66 attitudes and behaviors expected of care workers and analyzed the requirements for their work environments. We discuss two important requirements in designing workshops. The first is care recipient centered design to provide each recipient with person-centered care service. The second is service-provider centered design to provide care workers with experience in empathizing with care recipients so that they could deeply understand them and effectively provide the created care service.},

  abstract  = {Robotic Process Automation is a technology for lightweight task automation that empowers business users to build their own software bots by combining predefined operations in a graphical user interface. However, due to the detailed nature of these operations, which are comparable to single code instructions, the graphical models become complex and hard to understand. This complicates the sharing, discussion, and maintenance of these software bots. At the same time, RPA projects typically require extensive documentation of the process and its automation aspects that must be kept in sync during the maintenance phase. This paper presents a foundation for bot model abstraction in RPA that leverages semantic information. It proposes an abstraction method to generate smaller but still expressive bot models in an automated fashion. These abstract bot models can be used for documentation purposes and to foster process understanding, as they convey key activities while hiding operational details that are not relevant to perceiving the overall automation goal.},

  abstract  = {Accurate urban road traffic speed analysis and prediction are important for the application of intelligent transportation systems. However, the limited and inefficient traffic state monitoring infrastructure installed on urban roads makes it difficult to monitor the traffic state of an entire network. Moreover, the complex characteristics of urban road networks may lead to difficulties for traditional statistical and traffic flow models in dealing with this type of complex relationship. Therefore, this study proposes a network-wide traffic speed estimation model with full spatial and temporal coverage and selects floating vehicle trajectory data in an actual road network for experiments. The results show that the proposed model can accurately estimate the full spatiotemporal traffic state of a traffic network with only partial data input. This method can be effectively applied to urban road state estimation and can provide a scientific basis for traffic management departments to formulate congestion mitigation strategies.},

While LCDPs facilitate rapid application development by democratising application development platforms to non-professional developers (“citizen developers”), these organisations are challenged to establish strategic conformance with Low-Code applications regarding interoperability, scalability, security, and vendor lock-in. Since these LCDP challenges relate to the organisation’s enterprise strategy, the organisations should implement mitigations at the strategic level where Enterprise Architecture frameworks play an important role. This paper investigates how the LCDP challenges can be managed with the “Adaptive Integrated Digital Architecture Framework (AIDAF) with Design Thinking Approach.” A case project in a GPE verified that the AIDAF with Design Thinking Approach successfully supported managing a Low-Code application project and achieved strategic conformance with the developed Low-Code application. In addition, challenges and future issues for this research area are presented.},

The authors highlight the main trends in the management of digital companies, considering data as one of the key assets of the company. The article proposes to use the DAMA-DMBOK standard to implement the data-driven approach. The process of managing a company based on the analysis of data collected by the company is called the data-driven approach. This requires the development of the company’s IT infrastructure based on a holistic corporate data management strategy. Data Governance is defining as the activity of providing direction and control over the management of information assets, which allows you to bring the company’s work to a qualitatively new level. The purpose of the study is to increase the value of information assets of companies based on the use of a data-driven approach. To achieve this goal, it is proposing to develop the IT infrastructure of companies based on the DAMA DMBOK standard, which contains the best practices for implementing a data-driven approach. Because of the study, the authors proposed the model of the company’s IT infrastructure based on data-driven approach and DAMA DMBOK. The proposed model can be customizing for various industries and businesses. The dynamism of markets and the growing awareness of the importance of data as a differentiating factor in the competitive struggle is forcing organizations to rethink the distribution of authority and responsibility in data management. This trend is clearly visible in the financial, government, electronics and retail sectors.},

For a feature update, feature trees utilizing methods of software product line correspond to the evolution of behavior of a human and a machine by using a pairing safety rule structure. The results of a case study simulating autonomous driving systems and pedestrians in a city showed that the proposed safety rule structure can facilitate rule switching when features change. The results also showed that human-machine cooperation efficiency could be improved and safety maintained by operation following the change of safety rules in accordance with the proposed structure when the behavior of pedestrians and autonomous vehicles evolved.},

Incompleteness arises when a case lacks relevant information needed to solve a problem. Existing CBR systems often struggle to handle such cases, leading to sub-optimal solutions, and making it challenging to apply CBR in real-world settings. This paper highlights the importance of data quality in CBR and emphasizes the need for systems to handle incomplete data effectively. The authors provide for the first time a framework for addressing the issue of incompleteness under the open-world assumption. The proposed approach leverages a combination of data-driven and knowledge-based techniques to detect incompleteness. The approach offers a promising solution to the incompleteness dimension of data quality in CBR and has the potential to improve the practical utility of CBR systems in various domains as illustrated by the results of a real data-based evaluation.},

  abstract  = {It is almost unnecessary to emphasize the importance of the application of Industry 4.0 technologies, i.e. Artificial Intelligence, for the competitiveness of every modern company, both on the domestic and global markets. The speed with which these new technologies are developing seems unreal, but it is real. This knowledge “forces” company’s management to assess the company’s readiness to accept and apply the mentioned technology as soon as possible. First of all, it is important to understand that the implementation of Artificial Intelligence technologies requires significant investments in time and financial resources.That’s why companies should urgently conduct a readiness assessment to determine if they are ready for that step. The main goal of this paper is to show how to create and use a tool (a model with a knowledge base, which consists of a large number of IF -THEN rules and attributes) for assessing the readiness of companies to implement Industry 4.0 technologies, using one of the questionnaires used to make that assessment. In order to perform this procedure as quickly and simply as possible, a deductive approach was used to build an expert system with the help of the Doctus Knowledge Based System Shell.It should be noted that this approach, where Artificial Intelligence in the form of an expert system helps the faster application of other forms of Artificial Intelligence, will be used more and more often in practice. The secondary goal of this paper is to show the procedure of building and applying an expert system, i.e. a tool that will be used to assess the readiness of companies for Industry 4.0.},

The topology of a polyhedral space partition can be stored explicitly by pointers in a digital environment. However, coordinates are mapped to numbers which are unavoidably imprecise in a digital environment. The partition model is called consistent, if its imprecise geometric attributes do not contradict its exact topological attributes. The platform is called robust if the imprecision in typical applications does not make the model inconsistent. This paper presents two novel concepts that enhance robust modeling: focused model construction and topologically controlled work steps. Conventionally, each object is constructed individually and added to the existing set of objects. Geometric imprecision leads to collisions of and gaps between objects. The algorithms that detect collisions or gaps are not focused on a subset; and they are expensive because they must consider all existing objects. Focused transformations affect only a small number of domains. A work step is topologically controlled, if modifications on boundary elements of the domain must be performed in preceding work steps. Errors are reported and corrected before the construction proceeds. Topological checks are performed on the manifolds based on a rank concept. It is tested geometrically that all domains that are added to a domain lie inside the existing domain using the novel concept of anchors and their clients for robustness. Truncation and round-off errors are treated with a single value subjected to the machine epsilon.},

  abstract  = {Robots artificially replicate human capabilities thanks to their software, the main embodiment of intelligence. However, engineering robotics software has become increasingly challenging. Developers need expertise from different disciplines as well as they are faced with heterogeneous hardware and uncertain operating environments. To this end, the software needs to be variable—to customize robots for different customers, hardware, and operating environments. However, variability adds substantial complexity and needs to be managed—yet, ad hoc practices prevail in the robotics domain, challenging effective software reuse, maintenance, and evolution. To improve the situation, we need to enhance our empirical understanding of variability in robotics. We present a multiple-case study on software variability in the vibrant and challenging domain of service robotics. We investigated drivers, practices, methods, and challenges of variability from industrial companies building service robots. We analyzed the state-of-the-practice and the state-of-the-art—the former via an experience report and eleven interviews with two service robotics companies; the latter via a systematic literature review. We triangulated from these sources, reporting observations with actionable recommendations for researchers, tool providers, and practitioners. We formulated hypotheses trying to explain our observations, and also compared the state-of-the-art from the literature with the-state-of-the-practice we observed in our cases. We learned that the level of abstraction in robotics software needs to be raised for simplifying variability management and software integration, while keeping a sufficient level of customization to boost efficiency and effectiveness in their robots’ operation. Planning and realizing variability for specific requirements and implementing robust abstractions permit robotic applications to operate robustly in dynamic environments, which are often only partially known and controllable. With this aim, our companies use a number of mechanisms, some of them based on formalisms used to specify robotic behavior, such as finite-state machines and behavior trees. To foster software reuse, the service robotics domain will greatly benefit from having software components—completely decoupled from hardware—with harmonized and standardized interfaces, and organized in an ecosystem shared among various companies.},

  abstract  = {People with schizophrenia exhibit reduced alpha oscillations and frontotemporal coordination of brain activity. Alpha oscillations are associated with top-down inhibition. Reduced alpha oscillations may fail to censor spurious endogenous activity, leading to auditory hallucinations. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at the alpha frequency was shown to enhance alpha oscillations in people with schizophrenia and may thus be a network-based treatment for auditory hallucinations. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial to examine the efficacy of 10-Hz tACS in treating auditory hallucinations in people with schizophrenia. 10-Hz tACS was administered in phase at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction with a return current at Cz. Patients were randomized to receive tACS or sham for five consecutive days during the treatment week (40 min/day), followed by a maintenance period, during which participants received weekly tACS (40 min/visit) or sham. tACS treatment reduced general psychopathology ( p  < 0.05, Cohen’s d = −0.690), especially depression ( p  < 0.005, Cohen’s d = −0.806), but not auditory hallucinations. tACS treatment increased alpha power in the target region ( p  < 0.05), increased the frequency of peak global functional connectivity towards 10 Hz ( p  < 0.05), and reduced left-right frontal functional connectivity ( p  < 0.005). Importantly, changes in brain functional connectivity significantly correlated with symptom improvement ( p  < 0.05). Daily 10 Hz-tACS increased alpha power and altered alpha-band functional connectivity. Successful target engagement reduced depression and other general psychopathology symptoms, but not auditory hallucinations. Considering existing research of 10Hz tACS as a treatment for major depressive disorder, our study demonstrates its transdiagnostic potential for treating depression.},

  abstract  = {Most ductile damage models account for the triaxiality η -dependence of fracture strains, provided by the triaxiality failure diagram (TFD). η -values are commonly obtained from FE analysis. By contrast with von Mises materials, for anisotropic materials, η depends on yield criterion and material. The common procedure of matching numerical to experimental axial force–displacement (FD_L) responses may be insufficient because the transverse response (FD_W) is not validated. Further, the use of extensometers blurs local events. In this study, assuming different anisotropic yield criteria, we investigate for highly anisotropic Zirlo sheets (i) on a global level the FD_L and FD_W curves and (ii) on a local level the evolutions of the principal strain rate ratio β’ , which is related to η . Tests with uniaxial tension, notched and shear specimens were carried out. Strains were measured by DIC. The pre-critical region reveals that the yield model needs to account for anisotropy regarding r-values and flow. The extended Barlat89 yield criterion is therefore chosen for damage modeling. For selected specimens, representative η -values are determined as input to the anisotropic damage model MAGD. The other specimens serve validation. MAGD properties are obtained by optimization. Despite some deviation for shear, comparison of FD_L and FD_W responses with experiment shows favorable agreement for the combination of anisotropic yield and damage models used here and that more accurate prediction with strain-dependent r-values. β’ agree well with experimental data up to fracture, indicating accurate prediction of η up to fracture. By comparison with “undamaged” FE results, the single contributions of damage and the strain-dependence of r-values to β’ become apparent.},

  abstract  = {Agent-based models have been an emerging approach in epidemiological modelling, specifically in investigating the COVID-19 virus. However, there are challenges to its validation due to the absence of real data on specific socio-economic and cognitive aspects. Therefore, this work aims to present a strategy for updating, verifying and validating these models based on applying the particle swarm optimization algorithm to better model a real case. For such application, this work also presents a new framework based on multi-agents, whose significant contribution consists of forecasting needed hospital resources, population adaptative immunization and reports concerning demographic density, including physical and socio-economic aspects of a real society in the modelling task. Evaluation metrics such as the data’s Shape Factor (SF), Mean Square Error (RMSE), and statistical and sensitivity analyses of the responses obtained were applied for comparison with the real data. The Brazilian municipality of Passa Vinte, located in the State of Minas Gerais (MG), was used as a case study. The model was updated in cumulative cases until the 365th day of the pandemic. The statistical and sensitivity analysis results showed similar patterns around the actual data up to the 500th day of the pandemic. Their mean values of SF and RMSE were 0.96 and 7.22, respectively, showing good predictability and consistency, serving as an adequate tool for decision-making in health policies.},

Though structures of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of three SLC4 transporters, including AE1, have been resolved previously in their outward-facing (OF) state, no mammalian SLC4 structure has been reported in the inward-facing (IF) conformation. Here we present the cryoEM structures of full-length bovine AE1 with its TMD captured in both IF and OF conformations. Remarkably, both IF-IF homodimers and IF-OF heterodimers were detected. The IF structures feature downward movement in the core domain with significant unexpected elongation of TM11. Molecular modeling and structure guided mutagenesis confirmed the functional significance of residues involved in TM11 elongation. Our data provide direct evidence for an elevator-like mechanism of ion transport by an SLC4 family member.

  abstract  = {Within the fully integrated magnetosphere-ionosphere system, many electrodynamic processes interact with each other. We review recent advances in understanding three major meso-scale coupling processes within the system: the transient field-aligned currents (FACs), mid-latitude plasma convection, and auroral particle precipitation. (1) Transient FACs arise due to disturbances from either dayside or nightside magnetosphere. As the interplanetary shocks suddenly compress the dayside magnetosphere, short-lived FACs are induced at high latitudes with their polarity successively changing. Magnetotail dynamics, such as substorm injections, can also disturb the current structures, leading to the formation of substorm current wedges and ring current disruption. (2) The mid-latitude plasma convection is closely associated with electric fields in the system. Recent studies have unraveled some important features and mechanisms of subauroral fast flows. (3) Charged particles, while drifting around the Earth, often experience precipitating loss down to the upper atmosphere, enhancing the auroral conductivity. Recent studies have been devoted to developing more self-consistent geospace circulation models by including a better representation of the auroral conductance. It is expected that including these new advances in geospace circulation models could promisingly strengthen their forecasting capability in space weather applications. The remaining challenges especially in the global modeling of the circulation system are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Cyber risk assessment is a critical step in securing the digital systems that support modern society. Typically this is a manual process carried out by consultants or working groups with little or no software support outside of spreadsheet tools. As cybersecurity threats and digital systems themselves become more complex and dynamic, there is a need for greater tool support in the risk assessment process to document and trace assumptions and facilitate the revision or extension of a threat and risk assessment throughout a system’s lifecycle. The Cyber Security Argument Graph Evaluation (CyberSAGE) tool provides a platform for model-based cybersecurity analysis of cyber failure and attack scenarios. It combines models of high-level workflow, system architecture, device properties, attacker capability and skill, to compute holistic, quantitative security metrics. In this paper we describe the models, algorithms, and software architecture of the CyberSAGE tool. To illustrate its application, we describe an assessment carried out on communication systems in two railway lines with the support of an industry partner. Finally, we summarize feedback on the CyberSAGE tool from the railway case study partner, as well as over 40 interviews with practitioners and domain experts and a multinational electronics company who carried out a one year independent evaluation.},

  abstract  = {In image segmentation and in general in image processing, noise and outliers distort contained information posing in this way a great challenge for accurate image segmentation results. To ensure a correct image segmentation in presence of noise and outliers, it is necessary to identify the outliers and isolate them during a denoising pre-processing or impose suitable constraints into a segmentation framework. In this paper, we impose suitable removing outliers constraints supported by a well-designed theory in a variational framework for accurate image segmentation. We investigate a novel approach based on the power mean function equipped with a well established theoretical base. The power mean function has the capability to distinguishes between true image pixels and outliers and, therefore, is robust against outliers. To deploy the novel image data term and to guaranteed unique segmentation results, a fuzzy-membership function is employed in the proposed energy functional. Based on qualitative and quantitative extensive analysis on various standard data sets, it has been observed that the proposed model works well in images having multi-objects with high noise and in images with intensity inhomogeneity in contrast with the latest and state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract  = {Many countries that had early access to COVID-19 vaccines implemented vaccination strategies that prioritized health care workers and the elderly. As barriers to access eased, vaccine prioritization strategies have been relaxed. However, these strategies are still an important tool for decision makers to manage new variants, plan for future booster shots, or stage mass vaccinations. This paper explores the impact of vaccine prioritization strategies using networks that represent communities with different demographics and connectivity. The impact of vaccination is compared to non-medical intervention to reduce transmission. Several sources of uncertainty are considered, including vaccine willingness and mask effectiveness. This paper finds that while prioritization strategies can have a large impact on reducing deaths and peak hospitalization, selecting the best strategy depends on community characteristics and the desired objective. Additionally, in some cases random vaccination performs as well as more targeted prioritization strategies. Understanding these trade-offs is important when planning vaccine distribution.},

  abstract  = {Business processes can have variants depending on specific business requirements, which lead to the definition of a so-called business process family . Since conventional business process modeling languages, e.g., the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), do not explicitly support variants’ specification, several proposals have emerged to deal with it. However, they mainly focus on languages’ definition, while less emphasis is made on providing complete variability management. This article presents a Model-Driven Engineering approach for managing BPMN-based business process families composed of a metamodel for conceptualizing process families, a high-level process for managing them (involving model transformations for the configuration of variants), and tool support for the complete approach. We validated the proposal using a real-world example from a university and an empirical study with real users. Users rated the support tool’s principal functional suitability and usability features as very good. Many improvement opportunities were detected, e.g., version control, collaborative work, and error reporting. We also provide a literature review and thorough evaluation of BPMN-based business process families’ proposals using the VIVACE framework.},

We argue that bringing to other engineering and scientific fields, our modeling expertise is a win–win opportunity where we can all learn from each other as we all model, but in complementary ways. Nevertheless, to fully unleash the benefits of this collaboration, we must go beyond individual efforts trying to adapt single techniques from one field to another.

  abstract  = {Mobile applications are an essential element in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, and they face many challenges during their generation process from the analysis of user needs to the design of specific mobile interfaces and their development in several technological platforms. Moreover, the rise of Ambient Intelligent and context-aware environments also introduces multiple interaction aspects to be considered when using mobile devices in this kind of scenarios. The present work seeks to examine the role of design patterns and ontology models in order to help with the generation of mobile applications, which can be adapted at runtime to the various user needs, different context scenarios, interactive design modes, or technology requirements. In this way, an ontology-based framework is introduced to represent, design, and support the adaptation of user interfaces in mobile applications by using design patterns according to these user needs or preferences and the context around them. This framework provides developers with a client-server architecture that enables the access to an expert knowledge base of user, context, and pattern information together with a set of inference rules, which allow the dynamic selection of interface design patterns and the runtime adaptation of the user interface features. These ontology models and inference rules are key components of the proposed framework, and their implementation has helped to produce an example of mobile application supporting user interface adaptation processes for disabled people, which can be required in Ambient Intelligent environments. Three examples of user scenarios have been considered to assess the framework potential, and usability dimensions have been tested by a limited set of users through the produced mobile application, making the usefulness of generated adaptive user interfaces apparent.},

  abstract  = {Engineering projects involve a variety of artifacts such as requirements, design, or source code. These artifacts, many of which tend to be interdependent, are often manipulated concurrently. To keep artifacts consistent, engineers must continuously consider their work in relation to the work of multiple other engineers. Traditional consistency checking approaches reason efficiently over artifact changes and their consistency implications. However, they do so solely within the boundaries of specific tools and their specific artifacts (e.g., consistency checking between different UML models). This makes it difficult to examine the consistency between different types of artifacts (e.g., consistency checking between UML models and the source code). Global consistency checking can help addressing this problem. However, it usually requires a disruptive and time-consuming merging process for artifacts. This article presents a novel, cloud-based approach to global consistency checking in a multi-developer/-tool engineering environment. It allows for global consistency checking across all artifacts that engineers work on concurrently. Moreover, it reasons over artifact changes immediately after the change happened, while keeping the (memory/CPU) cost of consistency checking minimal. The feasibility and scalability of our approach were demonstrated by a prototype implementation and through an empirical validation.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a formal model-based methodology to support railway engineers in the design of safe electronic urban railway control systems. The purpose of our research is to overcome the deficiencies of existing traditional design methodologies, namely the incompleteness and the potential presence of contradictions in the system specification resulting from non-formal development techniques. We illustrate the application of the methodology via a case study of a tram-road level crossing protection system. It was chosen partly because it has a simple architecture and a small number of elements, thus it fits the scope limitations of this article. At the same time, it is suitable for presenting all essential features of our methodology. The proposed solution provides a specification/verification environment that facilitates the construction of correct, complete, consistent, and verifiable functional specifications during the development, while hiding all the formal method-related details from the railway engineers writing the specifications. Using this formal model-based methodology, a high-quality functional specification can be achieved, which is guaranteed to be more exhaustive and will contain fewer errors than traditional development.},

  abstract  = {Relations between requirements are part of nearly every requirements engineering approach. Yet, relations of views, such as requirements documents, are scarcely considered. This is remarkable as requirements documents and their structure are a key factor in requirements reuse, which is still challenging. Explicit formalized relations between documents can help to ensure consistency, improve completeness, and facilitate review activities in general. For example, this is relevant in space engineering, where many challenges related to complex document dependencies occur: 1. Several contractors contribute to a project. 2. Requirements from standards have to be applied in several projects. 3. Requirements from previous phases have to be reused. We exploit the concept of “layered traceability”, explicitly considering documents as views on sets of individual requirements and specific traceability relations on and between all of these representation layers. Different types of relations and their dependencies are investigated with a special focus on requirement reuse through standards and formalized in an Object-Role Modelling (ORM) conceptual model. Automated analyses of requirement graphs based on this model are able to reveal document inconsistencies. We show examples of such queries in Neo4J/Cypher for the EagleEye case study. This work aims to be a step toward a better support to handle highly complex requirement document dependencies in large projects with a special focus on requirements reuse and to enable automated quality checks on dependent documents to facilitate requirements reviews.},

From these efforts arose the need to analyze and represent data within a system to make it useful and understandable to people, for which dashboards emerge. The objective of these systems is to provide users with information to support decision-making, so it is essential to adapt the visualization of the information provided to their needs and preferences. However, the analysis of adaptability through user interaction and its benefits is a topic still under exploration. This paper analyzes the literature on information visualization in adaptable dashboards for smart cities. Based on the elements of adaptable dashboards identified in the literature review, we propose an adaptable dashboard architecture, identify the main characteristics of the users of a smart city dashboard, and build an adaptable dashboard prototype using user-centered techniques.},

  abstract  = {Drought risk assessment provides a vital basis for drought relief and prevention. We developed a dynamic agricultural drought risk (DADR) assessment model to predict drought trends and their impacts on crop yield in real time. A weather generator was employed to produce daily meteorological scenarios to simulate drought trends stochastically. Then, it was used to drive a crop model for simulating drought-induced yield loss. The yield loss rate was calculated to assess the DADR, whereas the cumulative yield loss rate was calculated to measure the cumulative impacts of drought on yield. The drought that occurred in the Liaoning Province in 2000 was selected as a case study, and the DADR was assessed weekly during the maize growth period. The statistical parameters of historical meteorological data were used to prove the rationality of meteorological scenarios. The crop data from 1996 to 2012 were used for crop model calibration and verification. The results showed that, on July 3, 2000, the majority of the Liaoning Province experienced severe or moderate DADR, which showed an increasing trend from east to west, while the highest DADR (over 35},

  abstract  = {Goal models have been a popular subject of study by researchers in requirements engineering, due to their ability to capture and analyze alternative solutions through which a software system can achieve business objectives. A plethora of analysis methods for automated identification of optimal alternatives have been proposed. However, such methods often assume an idealized reality where all tasks are successfully performed when attempted and all goals are eventually satisfied with certainty when pursued according to a solution. In reality, some tasks run the risk of failure while others produce chance outcomes. In this paper, we extend the standard goal modeling language to allow representation and reasoning about both uncertainty and preferential utility in goals. Tasks are extended to allow for probabilistic effects and preferential statements of stakeholders are captured and translated into utilities over possible effects. Moreover, solutions are not mere specifications (functions, quality constraints, and assumptions), but rather policies, that is sequences of situational action decisions, through which stakeholder goals can be fulfilled. An AI reasoning tool is adapted and used for identifying optimal policies with respect to the value they offer to stakeholders measured against their probability of failure. Evaluation of the approach includes a simulation study and scalability experiments to assess the applicability of automated reasoning for larger problems.},

This is closely connected to the ongoing activities and results from the SOPHIA project in which the inferred parameters are used for ergonomic assessments. Moreover, multiple options for digital human modelling, developed in the SOPHIA project, will be presented. In this context, the development process of personalized human models within the project to optimize the worker’s ergonomics when performing tasks with a robotic system or exoskeleton will be described. The paper closes with a short description of what still needs to be addressed to ensure personalized, reliable and robust digital human modelling for an industrial setting. Practical Relevance: This paper shows the scientific process within the SOPHIA project on the subject of digital human models. This provides an overview of the current state of research, as well as available and innovative approaches for modelling people at the workplace. It is shown to what extent the goal of creating personalized human models to optimize the ergonomics of employees that work with robotic systems or exoskeletons has already been achieved. Therewith, it is displayed which developments can already be used and which components are still missing in order to better simulate and thus enrich the interaction between humans and robots/exoskeletons. In diesem Beitrag wird aufgezeigt, wie die digitale Menschmodellierung zur Planung und Simulation kompletter Arbeitsabläufe eingesetzt werden kann und auf welche Parameter durch die Anwendung dieses Modellierungsansatzes geschlossen werden kann.

  abstract  = {Background and Objective Pharmacokinetic or pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models have been instrumental in facilitating the clinical use of propofol in target-controlled infusion systems in anaesthetic practice. There has been debate over which model should be recommended for practice. The covariates model is an updated pharmacokinetic model for propofol. The aim of this study was to prospectively validate this model in an adult population. Methods Twenty-nine patients were included, with a range of ages to assess model performance in younger and older individuals. Subjects received propofol through a target-controlled infusion device programmed with the covariates model. Subjects were randomised to one of two increasing/decreasing regimes of propofol plasma target concentrations between 2 and 5 μg.mL^−1. After the start of the infusion, arterial and venous blood samples were drawn at pre-specified timepoints between 1.5 and 20 min and between 1.5 and 45 min, respectively. Predictive performance was assessed using established methodology. Results The model achieved a bias of 9 (− 45 to 82) and precision of 24 (9–82) for arterial samples and bias of − 8 (− 64 to 70) and precision of 23 (9–70) for venous samples. Predicted concentrations tended to be higher than the measured concentrations in female individuals but lower in male individuals. There was no clear systematic difference in the bias between younger and older patients. Conclusions The covariates propofol pharmacokinetic model achieved an acceptable level of predictive performance, as assessed by both arterial and venous sampling, for use in target-controlled infusion in clinical practice. Clinical Trial Registration NCT01492712 (15 December, 2011) Pharmacokinetic models can estimate the changes in the concentration of a drug in the body over time. These have been instrumental in facilitating the clinical use of anaesthetic agents such as propofol in target-controlled infusions, which aim to achieve a set concentration in either plasma or the brain to achieve anaesthesia. The covariates model is a previously described pharmacokinetic model for propofol. The aim of the described study was to validate the performance of the model in an independent adult population. Participants received anaesthesia with propofol through a target-controlled infusion device programmed with the covariates model. The concentration of propofol in the blood was measured at various timepoints and compared to the target concentration specified by the target-controlled infusion device. The analysis showed that overall, the covariates model performed to a level acceptable for use in clinical practice and compared favourably to other pharmacokinetic models.},

  abstract  = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are increasingly leveraging autonomy in their decision-making to manage uncertainty in their operating environments. A key problem with SASs is ensuring their requirements remain satisfied as they adapt. The trade-off analysis of the non-functional requirements (NFRs) is key to establish balance among them. Further, when performing the trade-offs it is necessary to know the importance of each NFR to be able to resolve conflicts among them. Such trade-off analyses are often built upon optimisation methods, including decision analysis and utility theory. A problem with these techniques is that they use a single-scalar utility value to represent the overall combined priority for all the NFRs. However, this combined scalar priority value may hide information about the impacts of the environmental contexts on the individual NFRs’ priorities, which may change over time. Hence, there is a need for support for runtime, autonomous reasoning about the separate priority values for each NFR, while using the knowledge acquired based on evidence collected. In this paper, we propose Pri-AwaRE, a self-adaptive architecture that makes use of Multi-Reward Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MR-POMDP) to perform decision-making for SASs while offering awareness of NFRs’ priorities. MR-POMDP is used as a priority-aware runtime specification model to support runtime reasoning and autonomous tuning of the distinct priority values of NFRs using a vector-valued reward function. We also evaluate the usefulness of our Pri-AwaRE approach by applying it to two substantial example applications from the networking and IoT domains.},

  abstract  = {High-voltage and efficient power converter topologies equipped with the simple and practical controller circuits are necessary, especially for integration between the low-power and low-voltage renewable energy sources (RESs) like the photovoltaic (PV) arrays and the grid. These converters can be used widely in electrical vehicles (EVs) or charging stations, aquatic, medical, transportation application and other cases. This study proposes a switched capacitor (SC)-based quadratic boost converter (QBC) structure that provides high-voltage gain at low duty cycles equipped with the fuzzy logic control (FLC) technique. The output gain of the proposed converter is higher than a second-order step-up converter or a conventional QB circuit thanks to the presented switched-capacitor topology and the manipulation of the switches in conventional QBC. By using the second switch to the conventional QBC, the voltage stress across the main power switch will decrease that enhance the reliability and long-life of the converter. Since the SC block acts as an intermediate layer between the QB and load through the capacitors and diodes of this block, the voltage and current stresses of the power switches and diodes on the QB side are less than stresses for semiconductors for classical QB and boost converter. In this study, the proposed QBC and controller system are analyzed mathematically in detail and in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. A 200 W prototype was developed in the laboratory to validate the proposed converter and computerized analysis. Finally, the theoretical and experimental results were compared and verified.},

The testing shows that the precision of the solution can be easily driven by a few approximation parameters that can be changed during computation.

  abstract  = {The Arctic Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Arctic-CORDEX) uses regional climate models (RCMs) to downscale selected Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project simulations, allowing trend validation and projection on subregional scales. For 1986–2015, the CORDEX seasonal-average near-surface temperature ( tas ), wind speed ( sfcWind ), precipitation ( pr ) and snowfall ( prsn ) trends are generally consistent with analyses/observations for the Arctic Ocean regions considered. The projected Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) 2016–2100 subregional annual tas trends range from 0.03 to 0.18 K/year. Projected annual pr and prsn trends have a large inter-model spread centered around approximately 5.0 × 10^–8 mm/s/year and −5.0 × 10^–8 mm/s/year, respectively, while projected sfcWind summer and winter trends range between 0.0 and 0.4 m/s/year. For all variables except prsn , and sometimes total precipitation, the driving general circulation model (GCM) dominates the trends, however there is a tendency for the GCMs to underestimate the sfcWind trends compared to the RCMs. Subtracting the Arctic-Ocean mean from subregional trends reveals a consistent, qualitative anomaly pattern in several variables and seasons characterized by greater-than or average trends in the central and Siberian Arctic Ocean and lesser or average trends in the Atlantic Sector and the Bering Sea, related to summer sea-ice trends. In particular, a strong proportional relationship exists between the summer sea-ice concentration and fall tas and sfcWind trend anomalies. The RCP4.5 annual, multi-model mean trends are 35–55},

  abstract  = {Compliant joint plays a vital role in micro-positioning systems, robotics, and precision instruments due to its friction-free and fine motion. However, the existing joints are limited in range of motions and degrees of freedom. Thus, this paper proposes a new compliant joint (CJ) which is inspired from the dragonfly’s wing. The proposed joint can provide two translational motions with a large range of motion. The CJ has six curvilinear shapes which are arranged in a parallel architecture. Besides, the proposed joint has a thin-wall structure to enlarge the deformation capacity. Based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the analytical model is established to describe the stiffness and displacement of the joint. Effects of the joint’s geometries on the stiffness are investigated. The deformation and load capacities of the CJ are determined. The results showed that the displacement of the CJ in the y -axis is increased to 43.5},

  abstract  = {Usability is regarded to be a fundamental requirement for in-vehicle HMIs, and usability evaluation reflects the impact of the interface and the acceptance from the users. This study introduced a usability evaluation model of AR-HUD interface by applying grey analytic hierarchy process (AHP). First, based on the ameliorated PSSUQ (Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire), the usability evaluation system was modified and optimized according to the characteristics of AR-HUD. On this basis, the preference weights for evaluation indexes were calculated by AHP and the idea of group decision. Finally, the criteria of usability were integrated into grey relational degree by applying grey relational analysis (GRA) to obtain optimal design. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the developed model to the usability evaluation of AR-HUD interface design. According to the existing AR-HUD interface design, 7 dimensions of design elements (A-G) and 18 interface prototypes (S1-S18) were selected by Taguchi orthogonal array test (TOAT). As the results indicated, the grey relational degree of S5 was 0.923, signifying that it was the optimal sample; and the results were also compared with entropy-TOPSIS to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The grey-based AHP evaluation model can be used to evaluate the usability level of AR-HUD interface effectively, which may help designers achieve insights for design process and samples decision-making.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of parallel architectures points to dynamic environments where the number of available resources or configurations may vary during the execution of applications. This can be easily observed in grids and clouds, but can also be explored in clusters and multiprocessor architectures. Over more than two decades, several research initiatives have explored this characteristic by parallel applications, enabling the development of adaptive applications that can reconfigure the number of processes/threads and their allocation to processors to cope with varying workloads and changes in the availability of resources in the system. Despite the long history of development of solutions for adaptability for parallel architectures, there is no literature reviewing these efforts. In this context, the goal of this paper is to present the state of-the-art on adaptability from resource and application perspectives, ranging from shared memory architectures, clusters, and grids, to virtualized resources in cloud and fog computing in the last twenty years (2002-2022). A comprehensive analysis of the leading research initiatives in the field of adaptive parallel applications can provide the reader with an understanding of the essential concepts of development in this area.},

Practical applications use many lithium-ion batteries which are connected in series and in parallel. Many incidents have occurred due to battery safety issues in recent years. The connection of lithium-ion batteries has safety problems if the batteries are not well controlled in packing and assembling. In this regard, the use of enabling technologies is essential to the proper operation of the batteries’ assembly manufacturing. This paper investigates the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries smartly controlled by the industrial internet of things (IIoT)-based configuration for a real case.

  abstract  = {Taking agent-based models to the data is still very challenging for researchers. In this paper we propose a new method to calibrate the model parameters based on indirect inference, which consists in minimizing the distance between real and artificial data. Basically, we first introduce a nonparametric regression meta-model to approximate the relationship between model parameters and distance. Then the meta-model is estimated by local polynomial regression estimation on a small sample of parameter vectors drawn from the parameter space of the ABM. Finally, once the distance has been estimated we can pick the parameter vector minimizing it. One innovative feature of the method is the sampling scheme, based on sampling at the same time both the parameter vectors and the seed of the random numbers generator in a random fashion, which permits to average out the effect of randomness without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. A battery of simple calibration exercises performed on an agent-based macro model shows that the method allows to minimize the distance with good precision using relatively few simulations of the model.},

  abstract  = {The unprecedented road blockage mostly generates unnecessary hindrance, delay, and interruption during travel. Moreover, the emergence of the sudden third wave through the rapid spread of the omicron CoV-2 variant along with its new combinations with delta SARS-CoV-2 is leading to newer travel restrictions through various hotspots and containment zones contributing to enhanced travel interruption. While traveling, passengers in vehicles are unaware of road conditions during transit time due to blockage in a route. This causes a huge confusion and decision crisis at the edge of such blockage to find the most suitable alternative route. We have developed a software-based system including a mobile application that is capable of handling real-time constraints, transit service, and actual road conditions of a route. This system can be used to find and display alternative routes or maps without any confusion in case of sudden route blockage caused by mass gathering, accidents, or road construction in transit time. During this pandemic COVID-19, this system can also be used to avoid the localized hotspot for a safe and convenient journey. As this system is developed at the time of the pandemic, it is called an Automatic COVID-19 hotspot avoidance navigation system (ACHANS) that generates a unique optimal travel path while traveling to avoid road blockage/COVID-19 hotspot areas. The system works from the user perspective with coordination among the ACHANS Database, map routing server, ACHANS web applications, and ACHANS mobile applications. The process works by creating a buffer-centric radius generation, considering open and closed hotspot regions, and controlling clusters of hotspots. ACHANS database cum alternative roadways bypass system will be independently executed to avoid the localized hotspot for a safe and convenient journey. The proposed system is theoretically, experimentally, and statistically evaluated and verified for various traffic conditions where the performance dictates the efficacy of the scheme and can thereby establish travel and trade during the pandemic.},

  abstract  = {There are two broad modeling paradigms in scientific applications: forward and inverse. While forward modeling estimates the observations based on known causes, inverse modeling attempts to infer the causes given the observations. Inverse problems are usually more critical as well as difficult in scientific applications as they seek to explore the causes that cannot be directly observed. Inverse problems are used extensively in various scientific fields, such as geophysics, health care and materials science. Exploring the relationships from properties to microstructures is one of the inverse problems in material science. It is challenging to solve the microstructure discovery inverse problem, because it usually needs to learn a one-to-many nonlinear mapping. Given a target property, there are multiple different microstructures that exhibit the target property, and their discovery also requires significant computing time. Further, microstructure discovery becomes even more difficult because the dimension of properties (input) is much lower than that of microstructures (output). In this work, we propose a framework consisting of generative adversarial networks and mixture density networks for inverse modeling of structure–property linkages in materials, i.e., microstructure discovery for a given property. The results demonstrate that compared to baseline methods, the proposed framework can overcome the above-mentioned challenges and discover multiple promising solutions in an efficient manner.},

  abstract  = {The proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method is developed for parametric solutions of full stress fields in heterogeneous materials. PGD decouples the multi-dimensional problem into a product of low-dimensional expansion with an enrichment process to approximate the field solutions. The configurations of inclusions (size, location, and material properties) and other model parameters can be included as extra-coordinates in PGD formulations to develop parametric field solutions. Numerical examples of 2D linear elastic heterogeneous materials with an inclusion varying in size, location, and stiffness properties are studied. Almost invisible differences on the full stress fields were observed between FEA and PGD approximate solutions, with the mean squared error (MSE) mostly within 0.25 for the whole stress field. The proposed PGD implementation for heterogeneous materials is able to predict the full stress fields including all localized stress concentration patterns with high accuracy. The parametric solutions from the PGD framework enable online computations of full stress fields for heterogeneous materials, providing a viable way for design optimization, uncertainty quantification, and many other real-time tasks.},

Every day, its embedded devices generate loads of data that requires efficient network infrastructure. The integration of lightweight communication protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is to send millions of IoT messages back and forth with as few errors as possible. In practice, IoT big data analytic systems are often deployed with highly regarded MQTT solutions to handle huge amounts of dynamic data and achieve scalability. However, these solutions do not adapt well to fluctuations in workload, so they are not elastic yet. This article introduces a novel framework that provides just-enough elasticity for MQTT brokers with multiple levels of virtualization and its implementation using EMQX MQTT broker, Kubernetes container-orchestration system and OpenStack cloud environment.

Specifically, the CAD/CAM approach was employed to generate the ideal tool paths based on the CAD model, and the coarse registration ensured the global optimal solution of the subsequent fine registration. Considering the complex structure and the uneven shrinkage deformation of ceramic cores, the hybrid and local fine registration method was proposed to optimize the ideal tool paths in order to generate deburring tool paths. Moreover, the fine registration also eliminated the influence of inconsistent clamping errors of ceramic cores on the final accuracy of deburring tool paths. In order to select the optimal local fine registration methods, focusing on the accuracy of deburring tool paths, four rigid and non-rigid point cloud registration methods based on the iterative closest point algorithm were compared. Furthermore, a method for evaluating the accuracy of deburring tool paths was proposed. Finally, a repeatability experiment was performed to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. The generated deburring tool paths were verified and its effectiveness was proven on a five-axis laser processing equipment.},

An objective of early validation requires that system safety aspects be verified during the phase of software requirements analysis. Formal verification during requirements engineering phase can ensure the validity and consistency of functionality with respect to safety constraints. Predicates and existing patterns of formal properties representing absence, universality, existence, bounded existence, response and their popular derivatives are not sufficient to correctly represent the properties for the operational zones of single-shot safety critical systems.

After reviewing some results of the research on thought experiments in the natural sciences, we turn our attention to experiments and thought experiments in mathematics, especially in fundamental mathematics, and investigate what thought experiments can teach us there. If we accept the principle that mathematical practice can sometimes be best described by a pragmatist approach where the concept of experience in mathematics is considered from a new perspective, thought experiments can in some cases be a useful instrument different from both ‘mathematical experiments’ and ‘formal’ proofs: they are mathematical experiments using deviant methods.},

The adoption of a DevOps culture, along with its practices and tools, alleviates some of these new challenges. In this paper we propose a guide for the deployment of systems with a microservices architecture, considering the practices of a DevOps culture, providing practitioners with a base path to start implementing the necessary platform for this architecture. We conducted this work following the Design Science Research Methodology for Information Systems (DSRM). In this way, we identified the problem, and also defined the solution objectives through the execution of a Systematic Literature Mapping and a Gray Literature Review, having as a result the proposed guide. This work can be summarized as follows: (I) Identification of practices and technologies that support the deployment of microservices. (II) Identification of recommendations, challenges, and best practices for the deployment process. (III) Modeling of the microservices deployment process using SPEM. (IV) Integration of the knowledge in a guide to deploying microservices by adopting DevOps practices.},

  abstract  = {Microbenchmarking is a widely used form of performance testing in Java software. A microbenchmark repeatedly executes a small chunk of code while collecting measurements related to its performance. Due to Java Virtual Machine optimizations, microbenchmarks are usually subject to severe performance fluctuations in the first phase of their execution (also known as warmup). For this reason, software developers typically discard measurements of this phase and focus their analysis when benchmarks reach a steady state of performance. Developers estimate the end of the warmup phase based on their expertise, and configure their benchmarks accordingly. Unfortunately, this approach is based on two strong assumptions: (i) benchmarks always reach a steady state of performance and (ii) developers accurately estimate warmup. In this paper, we show that Java microbenchmarks do not always reach a steady state, and often developers fail to accurately estimate the end of the warmup phase. We found that a considerable portion of studied benchmarks do not hit the steady state, and warmup estimates provided by software developers are often inaccurate (with a large error). This has significant implications both in terms of results quality and time-effort. Furthermore, we found that dynamic reconfiguration significantly improves warmup estimation accuracy, but still it induces suboptimal warmup estimates and relevant side-effects. We envision this paper as a starting point for supporting the introduction of more sophisticated automated techniques that can ensure results quality in a timely fashion.},

Hence, control measures are continuously being optimized to guard against large-scale coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the intensity of control measures in response to different SARS-CoV-2 variants and the degree of outbreak control at city level. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in 49 cities with COVID-19 outbreaks between January 2020 and June 2022. Epidemiological data on COVID-19 were extracted from the National Health Commission, People’s Republic of China, and the population flow data were sourced from the Baidu migration data provided by the Baidu platform. Outbreak control was quantified by calculating the degree of infection growth and the time-varying reproduction number (

 R t ). The intensity of the outbreak response was quantified by calculating the reduction in population mobility during the outbreak period. Correlation and regression analyses of the intensity of the control measures and the degree of outbreak control for the Omicron variant and non-Omicron mutants were conducted, respectively.

We aim to develop a method to estimate the optical efficiency and the effective water path length of a newly designed SWIR spectroscopy skin measurement system using Monte-Carlo photon migration simulation. To estimate the optical efficiency and the effective water path length, we investigated the characteristics of Monte-Carlo photon migration simulation utilizing one layered simple skin model. Simulation of photon transport in skin was conducted for transmission, transflection, and reflection optical configurations in both first overtone (1540   1820 nm) and combination (2040   2380 nm) wavelength ranges. Experimental measurement of skin spectrum was done using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy based system to validate the estimation performance. Overall, the simulated results for optical efficiency and effective water path length are in good agreements with the experimental measurements, which shows the suggested method can be used as a means for the performance estimation and the design optimization of various in-vivo SWIR spectroscopic system.},

Moreover, this paper implements some application experiments on the isometric road of a three-intersection and obtains better prediction results of traffic density and traffic speed on the three-section highway. At the same time, compared with other existing prediction methods, the prediction model presented in this paper not only has higher accuracy, shorter prediction time and stronger anti-interference ability, but also has better effect on vehicle diversion. In addition, it also greatly relieves the traffic pressure on the road, maximizes the complementary advantages between intersections, and balances the good cooperation between each intersection.},

Both are necessary to understand links between EPP and regional climate variability. Here we use a chemistry-climate model to assess the importance of EPP on late winter/spring polar stratosphere. In transient simulations, the impact on NO_ y , ozone, and temperature is underestimated when using EPP forcing from the current recommendation of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The resulting temperature response is largely masked by overall dynamical variability. An idealised experiment with EPP forcing that reproduces observed levels of NO_ y results in a significant reduction of ozone (up to 25},

  abstract  = {Science aims to build and advance general theories from empirical data. This process is complicated by the immense volume of empirical data and scientific theories in some domains, for example in the field of health behavior change. Especially, a systematic mapping between empirical data and theoretical constructs is lacking. We propose a toolbox to establish that mapping. We adopted a modeling approach based on literature surveys to elicit requirements and to derive a metamodel. We adopted a graph-based database system to implement the metamodel, and designed a web-based tool for importing data from annotated text documents. To evaluate that toolbox (named SciModeler ), we have conducted a case study within the field of health behavior change to record three scientific theories, three empirical studies, and the mapping in-between. We have documented how SciModeler  aids closing gaps between empirical data and theoretical constructs. We have demonstrated that this enables new types of analyses by sharing example queries for (1) refining scientific theories, (2) exploring promising intervention strategies for a specific context, and (3) checking the potential impact of an intervention platform in a specific context. Our supplementary materials promote replication of these results. SciModeler  can support the consolidation of scientific knowledge in the field of health behavior change, and we suggest that it may be applied within other fields, as well.

  abstract  = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential transfer of a metamodel for heritage-based urban development (HBUD) in a postcrisis urban recovery scenario. Design/methodology/approach After an introduction to the field of cultural heritage as a resource for urban development, the research question is elaborated, and the current understanding of urban heritage is explored. The use of the metamodel in a postcrisis urban recovery setting is described as a potential solution. The proposed metamodel is introduced along with the grounded theory and design research methodology through which it was developed. The specific qualities of metamodels and how they can contribute to the proposed use are highlighted. The scenario is then developed further, and specific ways in which the metamodel could contribute are elaborated. Finally, the metamodel is compared to other methods, such as the historic urban landscape (HUL) approach, and the limitations are discussed. Findings The metamodel can potentially be used in a postcrisis urban recovery scenario. The metamodel cannot be used directly, owing to the nature of metamodels; however, it can be transferred to a specific context and help to structure successful heritage-based urban recovery (HBUR) processes. Practical limitations/implications One limitation is that it can be difficult to understand the differences between models and metamodels. Only with a comprehensive understanding of the nature of metamodels can this metamodel be applied, for example, to select appropriate models for HBUR. The metamodel can help to ensure that all relevant ‘elements’ are part of the processes designed for HBUR and emphasise the need for thorough planning, or scoping, of such processes. Originality/value Metamodelling has not previously been used for HBUD or HBUR.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Mosquito species belonging to the genus Aedes have attracted the interest of scientists and public health officers because of their capacity to transmit viruses that affect humans. Some of these species were brought outside their native range by means of trade and tourism and then colonised new regions thanks to a unique combination of eco-physiological traits. Considering mosquito physiological and behavioural traits to understand and predict their population dynamics is thus a crucial step in developing strategies to mitigate the local densities of invasive Aedes populations. Here, we synthesised the life cycle of four invasive Aedes species ( Ae. aegypti , Ae. albopictus , Ae. japonicus and Ae. koreicus ) in a single multi-scale stochastic modelling framework which we coded in the R package dynamAedes . We designed a stage-based and time-discrete stochastic model driven by temperature, photo-period and inter-specific larval competition that can be applied to three different spatial scales: punctual, local and regional. These spatial scales consider different degrees of spatial complexity and data availability by accounting for both active and passive dispersal of mosquito species as well as for the heterogeneity of the input temperature data. Our overarching aim was to provide a flexible, open-source and user-friendly tool rooted in the most updated knowledge on the species’ biology which could be applied to the management of invasive Aedes populations as well as to more theoretical ecological inquiries.

As such, their study proves crucial in several areas of contemporary astrophysics, extending to astrobiology. In this review, I will summarize current knowledge about CNO element evolution in galaxies, starting from our home, the Milky Way. After a brief recap of CNO synthesis in stars, I will present the comparison between chemical evolution model predictions and observations of CNO isotopic abundances and abundance ratios in stars and in the gaseous matter. Such a comparison permits to constrain the modes and time scales of the assembly of galaxies and their stellar populations, as well as stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theories. I will stress that chemical evolution models must be carefully calibrated against the wealth of abundance data available for the Milky Way before they can be applied to the interpretation of observational datasets for other systems. In this vein, I will also discuss the usefulness of some key CNO isotopic ratios as probes of the prevailing, galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function in galaxies where more direct estimates from the starlight are unfeasible.},

  abstract  = {Here the authors observe transcription dynamics in real-time throughout erythropoiesis by combining PP7 tagging of α-globin RNA transcripts and “on-microscope” cell staging. They show how the pattern of transcriptional bursting changes during differentiation, with variability in individual cells significantly reduced at the peak period of gene expression. Determining the mechanisms by which genes are switched on and off during development is a key aim of current biomedical research. Gene transcription has been widely observed to occur in a discontinuous fashion, with short bursts of activity interspersed with periods of inactivity. It is currently not known if or how this dynamic behaviour changes as mammalian cells differentiate. To investigate this, using an on-microscope analysis, we monitored mouse α-globin transcription in live cells throughout erythropoiesis. We find that changes in the overall levels of α-globin transcription are most closely associated with changes in the fraction of time a gene spends in the active transcriptional state. We identify differences in the patterns of transcriptional bursting throughout differentiation, with maximal transcriptional activity occurring in the mid-phase of differentiation. Early in differentiation, we observe increased fluctuation in transcriptional activity whereas at the peak of gene expression, in early erythroblasts, transcription is relatively stable. Later during differentiation as α-globin expression declines, we again observe more variability in transcription within individual cells. We propose that the observed changes in transcriptional behaviour may reflect changes in the stability of active transcriptional compartments as gene expression is regulated during differentiation.},

Consequently, the integrating discipline model-driven software product line engineering (MDSPLE) aims at combining the best of both worlds by creating multi-variant models which are (automatically) configured into single-variant models which are in turn adapted further (if required). Inherently complex multi-variant models call for urgently needed tools providing support for editing multi-variant models. In this paper, we present a framework for projectional multi-variant editors which make complexity manageable using a user-friendly representation. At all times, a domain engineer is aware of editing a multi-variant model which is necessary to assess the impact of changes on all model variants. Supporting a clear separation of product space (domain model) and variant space (variability annotations), our projectional multi-variant editors provide a novel approach to representing variability information which is displayed non-intrusively. Furthermore, the domain engineer may employ a projectional multi-variant editor to adapt the representation of the multi-variant domain model in a flexible way, according to the current focus of interest.},

The results show that the support stiffness of the sprocket shaft and the transversal support stiffness of the oil cylinder affect the longitudinal vibration of the chain.

  abstract  = {Building energy modeling, also known as building energy simulation, has developed rapidly in recent years and plays a crucial role in building life-cycle analysis. It can be employed in the design phase to predict the energy consumption of different design schemes and evaluate various control and retrofitting measures at the operation stage. In such simulations, it is commonly understood and accepted that the simulated relative differences are more reliable than the predictions of absolute energy results. However, whether this common understanding is true is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we investigate the simulated relative differences and the extent to which they are affected by the degree of model input deviation. Simulation and Monte Carlo approaches are adopted for the analysis. The results indicate that the simulated relative differences are not as reliable as expected, and the outputs strongly depend on the degree of the model input deviation. When the degree of deviation is less than 15},

  abstract  = {Climate change threatens the current protection provided by coastal defences in low-lying mid-latitude regions and increases the risk to coastal lakes from future frequent and intense storms. Quantifying and understanding the impacts of past storm surges, therefore, has significant implications for the management and conservation of coastal wetlands worldwide. However, short-term (< 10 year) increases in salinity driven by storm surges are problematic to reconstruct via the palaeolimnological record due to sampling resolution and smoothing of trends. Here, we propose that the geochemistry (Sr/Ca and δ^18O) of calcitic shells of ostracods (small bivalved crustaceans readily preserved in lacustrine sediments) is a potentially sensitive proxy for reconstructing salinity, in some cases quantitatively, in comparison with sedimentary proxies of allochthonous sediment inputs (XRF and grain size) or other biological proxies. The coastal lakes of the Thurne Broads (Norfolk and Suffolk Broads National Park) in East Anglia, UK, have a long history of sea floods associated with storm surge events in the North Sea, providing a test bed to compare ostracod palaeosalinity reconstructions (using a site-specific calibration) with known storm surges in the region. We show that Sr/Ca_shell values closely match known salinity changes associated with storm surges; archival records of the salinity of Horsey Mere in CE 1940 suggest a maximum salinity of 13.4 PSU with ostracod Sr/Ca_shell palaeosalinity calibrations giving a maximum value of 18.3 PSU. Ostracod shell chemistry, therefore, has the potential to afford more reliable reconstructions of high intensity short-term increases in salinity in mid-latitude low-lying coastal lakes.},

  abstract  = {The state estimation ensures the secure and reliable operation of modern-day power systems by accurate monitoring of its states, voltage magnitudes and phase angles. A robust estimator can detect erroneous measurements, also known as bad-data, and eliminate those automatically during the estimation process. Least measurement rejected (LMR) is one of such robust estimators which has been found significantly successful in dealing with bad-data of various categories. In the LMR algorithm, a certain tolerance needs to be imposed on each measurement and the performance of the estimator mostly depends upon it. Different approaches to tolerance selection have been tried in the literature. The novelty of this paper lies in proposing an original approach of improving the accuracy of LMR by appropriate selection of tolerance. The double-layer selection process assigns a unique number to each measurement, based on the meter quality. LMR, with six different versions of tolerance values, is used from the literature, under different bad-data scenarios, to check whether the proposed tuned LMR (TLMR) performs better than those or not. Besides, some widely used robust estimators are simulated to prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach. It has been observed that the estimation accuracy has been improved significantly than the older versions after being subjected to the proposed mechanism. Moreover, TLMR has successfully outperformed the other estimators while dealing with white noise, bad-data and leverage point scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, building energy models (BEMs) are widely used, particularly in the assessment of energy consumption in buildings to address the potential savings that can be generated. The realisation of a dynamic energy model based on high-fidelity physics (white-box models) requires a tuning process to fit the model to reality, due to many uncertainties involved. Currently some research trends try to reduce this performance gap by modulating different types of experimental parameters such as: capacitances or infiltration. The EnergyPlus simulation software, in its latest versions, has implemented an object: HybridModel:Zone that calculates the infiltration and internal mass of buildings using an inverse modelling approach that employs only the measured indoor temperature data to invert the heat balance equation for the zone under study. The main objective of this paper is to reduce the execution time and uncertainties in the development of quality energy models by generating a new calibration methodology that implements this approach. This uses, as a starting point, a research created by the authors of this study, which was empirically and comparatively validated against the energy models developed by the participants in Annex 58. It is also worth highlighting the empirical validation of the HybridModel:Zone object, since it was activated in all scenarios where its execution is possible: periods of seven days or more of free oscillation and periods in which the building is under load. The findings are promising. The data generated with the new methodology, if compared with those produced by the baseline model, improve their resemblance to the real ones by 22.9},

This perspective describes such algorithms and discusses their potential applications to problems in geoscience, ranging from reconstruction and modeling of geomedia, to simulating fluid flow by the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, or lattice Boltzmann and lattice gas methods, numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation, pattern recognition in and analysis of big data, machine learning methods, and image processing. Although several hurdles remain that must be overcome before practical computations with quantum computers, and in particular those associated with geoscience, become possible, such as designing fault-tolerant quantum computers, which is still far into the future, noisy intermediate-scale computers are already available whose capabilities have been demonstrated for various problems.},

  abstract  = {Quantum simulation has emerged as a valuable arena for demonstrating and understanding the capabilities of near-term quantum computers^ 1 – 3 . Quantum annealing^ 4 , 5 has been successfully used in simulating a range of open quantum systems, both at equilibrium^ 6 – 8 and out of equilibrium^ 9 – 11 . However, in all previous experiments, annealing has been too slow to coherently simulate a closed quantum system, due to the onset of thermal effects from the environment. Here we demonstrate coherent evolution through a quantum phase transition in the paradigmatic setting of a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain, using up to 2,000 superconducting flux qubits in a programmable quantum annealer. In large systems, we observe the quantum Kibble–Zurek mechanism with theoretically predicted kink statistics, as well as characteristic positive kink–kink correlations, independent of temperature. In small chains, excitation statistics validate the picture of a Landau–Zener transition at a minimum gap. In both cases, the results are in quantitative agreement with analytical solutions to the closed-system quantum model. For slower anneals, we observe anti-Kibble–Zurek scaling in a crossover to the open quantum regime. The coherent dynamics of large-scale quantum annealers demonstrated here can be exploited to perform approximate quantum optimization, machine learning and simulation tasks. The coherent dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model driven through a quantum phase transition can be accurately simulated using a large-scale quantum annealer.},

  abstract  = {A fuzzy classification scheme that results in physically interpretable meteorological patterns associated with rainfall generation is applied to classify homogeneous regions of boreal summer rainfall anomalies in Germany. Four leading homogeneous regions are classified, representing the western, southeastern, eastern, and northern/northwestern parts of Germany with some overlap in the central parts of Germany. Variations of the sea level pressure gradient across Europe, e.g., between the continental and maritime regions, is the major phenomenon that triggers the time development of the rainfall regions by modulating wind patterns and moisture advection. Two regional climate models (REMO and CCLM4) were used to investigate the capability of climate models to reproduce the observed summer rainfall regions. Both regional climate models (RCMs) were once driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and once by the MPI-ESM general circulation model (GCM). Overall, the RCMs exhibit good performance in terms of the regionalization of summer rainfall in Germany; though the goodness-of-match with the rainfall regions/patterns from observational data is low in some cases and the REMO model driven by MPI-ESM fails to reproduce the western homogeneous rainfall region. Under future climate change, virtually the same leading modes of summer rainfall occur, suggesting that the basic synoptic processes associated with the regional patterns remain the same over Germany. We have also assessed the added value of bias-correcting the MPI-ESM driven RCMs using a simple linear scaling approach. The bias correction does not significantly alter the identification of homogeneous rainfall regions and, hence, does not improve their goodness-of-match compared to the observed patterns, except for the one case where the original RCM output completely fails to reproduce the observed pattern. While the linear scaling method improves the basic statistics of precipitation, it does not improve the simulated meteorological patterns represented by the precipitation regimes.},

  abstract  = {Position control of the mechanical structure with naturally limited stiffness is a common problem. Moreover, the system is usually exposed to random exciting by the external force effects and yet it is needed to hold the system in the desired position. Such an example in engineering practice can be the machine tool quill slim structure, which determines the machining accuracy and the machined surface quality. The limited structure stiffness can be overcome by suitable support structure solution. In principle, it is a matter of introducing the necessary force effect in the place where it is necessary to ensure the required position. A promising means how to apply control force to the flexible structure tip can be a thin cable structure with the force actuation and proper force control. The resulting system is characterized by increased stiffness achieved in a mechatronic manner. Therefore, the introduced concept is called mechatronic stiffness. The article describes selected mechanical arrangement of the mechatronic stiffness concept, its features, behaviour and control results. The proposed approach offers a solution for precise position control of the flexible structure. An experimental device was created in parallel with the simulation experiment and preliminary simulation results are obtained. The described concept is transferable to other flexible structures such as various manipulators.},

Annual food caloric production is the product of caloric yield, cropping frequency (CF, number of production seasons per year) and cropland area. Existing studies have largely focused on crop yield, whereas how CF responds to climate change remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the global climate sensitivity of caloric yields and CF at national scale. We find a robust negative association between warming and both caloric yield and CF. By the 2050s, projected CF increases in cold regions are offset by larger decreases in warm regions, resulting in a net global CF reduction (−4.2 ± 2.5},

  abstract  = {The intrusion of sea saltwater has destructive effects on freshwater resources as well as hydraulic structures. The first disastrous effect is reducing the volume of available freshwater storage and reducing available surface water quality. Various methods are used to prevent salinity intrusion into upstream river. One of the applied systems in reducing salinity intrusion in the mouth of rivers and especially in the shipping locks is the air bubbles curtain. For proper use of the air bubbles curtain system, it is necessary to determine the effect of different parameters on its performance. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of seawater density and air bubbles discharge on the performance of the air bubbles curtain was studied using a numerical model. The results show that the air bubbles curtain can prevent salinity intrusion by forming a vertical flow. Indeed, the air bubbles curtain's proper performance depends on the air bubbles discharge and the difference between saltwater and freshwater density. In other words, an increase in the density of seawater raises the salinity intrusion force and thus leads to the formation of a clockwise rotational flow upstream of the air bubbles curtain, which in turn intensifies the salinity intrusion into upstream of the air bubbles curtain and reduces the efficiency of the air bubbles curtain. Increasing air bubbles discharge culminates in preventing saltwater intrusion, although there is an optimal discharge that discharges greater than it has insignificant effects on air bubbles curtain performance.},

  abstract  = {Pathophysiology associated with Huntington’s disease (HD) has been studied extensively in various cell and animal models since the 1993 discovery of the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) with abnormally expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts as the causative factor. However, the sequence of early pathophysiological events leading to HD still remains elusive. To gain new insights into the early polyQ-induced pathogenic events, we expressed Htt exon1 (Htt_ex1) with a normal (21), or an extended (42 or 63) number of polyQ in tobacco plants. Here, we show that transgenic plants accumulated Htt_ex1 proteins with corresponding polyQ tracts, and mHtt_ex1 induced protein aggregation and affected plant growth, especially root and root hair development, in a polyQ length-dependent manner. Quantitative proteomic analysis of young roots from severely affected Htt_ex1Q63 and unaffected Htt_ex1Q21 plants showed that the most reduced protein by polyQ63 is a GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) along with many of its related one-carbon (C_1) metabolic pathway enzymes. GTPCH is a key enzyme involved in folate biosynthesis in plants and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH_4) biosynthesis in mammals. Validating studies in 4-week-old R6/2 HD mice expressing a mHtt_ex1 showed reduced levels of GTPCH and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, a key folate utilization/alternate BH_4 biosynthesis enzyme), and impaired C_1 and BH_4 metabolism. Our findings from mHtt_ex1 plants and mice reveal impaired expressions of GTPCH and DHFR and may contribute to a better understanding of mHtt-altered C_1 and BH_4 metabolism, and their roles in the pathogenesis of HD.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate modeling has become the method of choice in solving an increasing number of antenna design tasks, especially those involving expensive full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Notwithstanding, the curse of dimensionality considerably affects conventional metamodeling methods, and their capability to efficiently handle nonlinear antenna characteristics over broad ranges of the system parameters is limited. Performance-driven (or constrained) modeling frameworks may be employed to mitigate these issues by considering a construction of surrogates from the standpoint of the antenna performance figures rather than directly geometry parameters. This permits a significant reduction of the model setup cost without restricting its design utility. This paper proposes a novel modeling framework, which capitalizes on the domain confinement concepts and also incorporates variable-fidelity EM simulations, both at the surrogate domain definition stage, and when rendering the final surrogate. The latter employs co-kriging as a method of blending simulation data of different fidelities. The presented approach has been validated using three microstrip antennas, and demonstrated to yield reliable models at remarkably low CPU costs, as compared to both conventional and performance-driven modeling procedures.},

Moreover, a generic surgical process model for these differences in MILTs is introduced. The generic surgical process model was established at three different granularity levels. The generic process model, encompassing thirteen phases, was verified against videos of MILT procedures and interviews with surgeons. The established model covers all the surgical and interventional activities and the connections between them and provides a foundation for extensive quantitative analysis and simulations of MILT procedures for improving computer-assisted surgery systems, surgeon training and evaluation, surgeon guidance and planning systems and evaluation of new technologies.},

Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods, data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible, but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.},

  abstract  = {During the development of a software project, different developers collaborate on creating and changing models. These models evolve and need to be versioned. Over the past several years, progress has been made in offering dedicated support for model versioning that improves on what is being supported by text-based version control systems. However, there is still need to understand model differences in terms of the semantics of the modeling language, and to visualize the changes using its concrete syntax. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive approach—called DSMCompare —that considers both the abstract and the concrete syntax of a domain-specific language (DSL) when expressing model differences, and which supports defining domain-specific semantics for specific difference patterns. The approach is based on the automatic extension of the DSL to enable the representation of changes and on the automatic adaptation of its graphical concrete syntax to visualize the differences. In addition, we allow for the definition of semantic differencing rules to capture recurrent domain-specific difference patterns. Since these rules can be conflicting with each other, we introduce algorithms for conflict resolution and rule scheduling. To demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach, we report on evaluations based on synthetic models and on version histories of models developed by third parties.},

  abstract  = {With the increasing computing and networking capabilities, IoT devices and edge gateways have become part of a larger IoT–edge–cloud computing continuum, where processing and storage tasks are distributed across the whole network hierarchy, not concentrated only in the cloud. At the same time, this also introduced continuous delivery practices to the development of software components for network-connected gateways and sensing/actuating nodes. These devices are placed on end users’ premises and are characterized by continuously changing cyber-physical contexts, forcing software developers to maintain multiple application versions and frequently redeploy them on a distributed fleet of devices with respect to their current contexts. Doing this correctly and efficiently goes beyond manual capabilities and requires an intelligent and reliable automated solution. This paper describes a model-based approach to automatically assigning multiple software deployment plans to hundreds of edge gateways and connected IoT devices implemented in collaboration with a smart healthcare application provider. From a platform-specific model of an existing edge computing platform, we extract a platform-independent model that describes a list of target devices and a pool of available deployment plans. Next, we use constraint solving to automatically assign deployment plans to devices at once with respect to their specific contexts. The result is transformed back into the platform-specific model and includes a suitable deployment plan for each device, which is then consumed by our engine to deploy software components not only on edge gateways but also on their downstream IoT devices with constrained resources and connectivity. We validate the approach with a fleet deployment prototype integrated into a DevOps toolchain used by the partner application provider. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach and its usefulness in supporting DevOps for edge and IoT software development.},

  abstract  = {Functional requirements on a software system are traditionally captured as text that describes the expected functionality in the domain of a real-world system. Natural language processing methods allow us to extract the knowledge from such requirements and transform it, e.g., into a model. Moreover, these methods can improve the quality of the requirements, which usually suffer from ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency. This paper presents a novel approach to using natural language processing. We use the method of grammatical inspection to find specific patterns in the description of functional requirement specifications (written in English). Then, we transform the requirements into a model of Normalized Systems elements. This may realize a possible component of the eagerly awaited text-to-software pipeline. The input of this method is represented by textual requirements. Its output is a running prototype of an information system created using Normalized Systems (NS) techniques. Therefore, the system is ready to accept further enhancements, e.g., custom code fragments, in an evolvable manner ensured by compliance with the NS principles. A demonstration of pipeline implementation is also included in this paper. The text processing part of our pipeline extends the existing pipeline implemented in our system TEMOS, where we propose and implement methods of checking the quality of textual requirements concerning ambiguity, incompleteness, and inconsistency.},

The authors try to employ a joint image matching and generation end-to-end framework that consists of region-match module for matching images and attentional feature selector module for sampling pixels. For evaluation, we synthesize a pseudo paired dataset based on the LOL dataset and establish several groups of real-captured images under different collecting circumstances.

It entails time restrictions, which a semi-finished products’ (including metal products) manufacturer must meet. This issue must be addressed during a design phase, which for the most of semi-finished products suppliers, takes part during a quotation preparation process. Our research is aimed at investigating possibility of application of Fuzzy Reasoning methods for shortening of a design process, being a part of this process. We present a study on application of simplified models for solving technological tasks, allowing obtaining expected properties of designed products. The core of our concept is replacing numerical models and classical metamodels with a rule-based reasoning. A quotation preparation process can be supported by solving a technological problem without numerical experiments. Our goal was to validate the thesis basing not only on the presentation of some potential solutions but also on the results of simulation studies. The problem is illustrated with an example of thermal treatment of aluminum alloys, aimed at evaluation of a summary fraction of precipitations as a function of time and technological parameters. We assumed that it is possible to use both unstructured and point numerical experiments for knowledge acquisition. Implementation of this concept required the use of hybrid knowledge acquisition methods that combine the results of point experiments with expert knowledge. A comparison of obtained results to the ones obtained with metamodels shows a similar efficiency of both approaches, while our method is less time and laborious.},

We validate our approach with experimental imaging data acquired from a soft silicone beam under gravity. In contrast with inverse iterative algorithms that require multiple solutions of a standard elasticity problem, the proposed method can compute the undeformed configuration by solving only one modified elasticity problem. This modified problem has a complexity comparable to the standard one. The framework is implemented within an open-source pipeline enabling the direct and inverse deformation simulation directly from imaging data. We use the high-level unified form language (UFL) of the FEniCS Project to express the finite-element model in variational form and to automatically derive the consistent Jacobian. Consequently, the design of the pipeline is flexible: for example, it allows the modification of the constitutive models by changing a single line of code. We include a complete working example showing the inverse deformation of a beam deformed by gravity as supplementary material.},

  abstract  = {Space hyper-redundant cable-driven robots (SHCDRs) have a slender body structure and high dexterity, which is very suitable for complex and limited unstructured space environments. Due to the multi-level coupling relationship between motors, cables, joints, and tips, the accurate mathematical model is also uncertain, making the motion accuracy of the end-effector much lower than that of traditional industrial robots. Based on this, this article proposes two trajectory tracking control (TTC) methods for SHCDRs considering model uncertainty, one is based on model modification, and the other on two-layer iterative learning control (TLILC). This study first establishes a multi-level motion coupling model, and improve the inverse dynamics equation for the control requirements. Then, two different vision feedback-based TTC frameworks are developed. Further, both frameworks are solved by different iterative methods. Finally, in order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TTC methods, numerical simulation systems (including VC++, OSG, and MATLAB/Simulink) are conducted on a 12-DOF SHCDR to validate the two proposed methods. The results show that the proposed two vision-based TTC methods have higher tracking accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The nodal integral method (NIM) has been applied to a variety of both linear and non-linear problems. Here, we outline the development of an NIM scheme for the indefinite Helmholtz equation to simulate acoustic wave propagation. NIM has a simple formulation, and can yield accurate results with coarse grids. In the development of the scheme, the partial differential equation is averaged over a node by a transverse integration process (TIP). While performing the TIP, the product of the wave number and the function are incorporated in pseudo source terms, leading to a simple scheme. The ordinary differential equations resulting from the TIP are solved analytically, constituting the distinguishing step in NIM that leads to accurate solutions. We present the dispersion analysis of the NIM scheme for the very first time to quantify numerical dispersion. We then benchmark the wavefields and time domain seismograms computed from NIM with the analytical solution for a homogeneous model. We find that the NIM scheme yields second-order accurate results for the homogeneous model. Finally, we compute time domain seismograms for the Marmousi model and compare the results with the second-order central finite difference method in the time domain. The second-order scheme presented here is the very first application of NIM to the solution of the acoustic wave equation.},

  abstract  = {Asset Management of a complex technical system-of-systems needs cross-organizational operation and maintenance, asset data management and context-aware analytics. Emerging technologies such as AI and digitalisation can facilitate the augmentation of asset management (AAM), by providing data-driven and model-driven approaches to analytics, i.e., now-casting and forecasting. However, implementing context-aware now-casting and forecasting analytics in an operational environment with varying contexts such as for fleets and distributed infrastructure is challenging. The number of algorithms in such an implementation can be vast due to the large number of assets and operational contexts for the fleet. To reduce the complexity of the analytics, it is required to optimize the number of algorithms. This can be done by optimizing the number of operational contexts through a generalization and specialization approach based on both fleet behaviour and individual behaviour for improved analytics. This paper proposes a framework for context-aware now-casting and forecasting analytics for AAM based on a top-down, i.e., Fleet2Individual and bottom-up, i.e., Individual2Fleet approach. The proposed framework has been described and verified by applying it to the context of railway rolling stock in Sweden. The benefits of the proposed framework is to provide industries with a tool that can be used to simplify the implementation of AI and digital technologies in now-casting and forecasting.},

  abstract  = {Purpose For the vibrating machine with linear motion, the traditional driving method is utilizing the self-synchronization of double vibrators, or using a single motor to drive a pair of forced synchronization vibrators by the gear meshing. In this paper, we propose and study a special linear motion vibrating system (VS) driven by only the single vibrator, where the vibrator is mounted on a pendulum (so called pendulum bob) and no synchronization strategy is involved. Methods The Lagrange’s equation is used to obtain the motion differential equations of the system. Based on the vibration mechanics principle, the theory condition to guarantee the linear motion of the main working rigid frame (MWRF) is deduced, and the double frequency vibrating transmission (VT) between the pendulum and the MWRF is investigated. Simultaneously, some qualitative analyses are given to further reveal the special motion characteristics of the system by numeric. The the Runge-Kutta routine is applied directly to the motion differential equations of the system and the experiment is carried out to further verify the validity of the theoretical results. Results The results show that the special linear motion of the MWRF can be realized for the proposed dynamic model when satisfying the corresponding theory condition in the absence of self-synchronous or forced synchronization strategy, and in this case the system stability is relatively strong. Conclusion To guarantee the linear motion of the MWRF, the stiffness and damping, generating from the connection coupling between the pendulum and the MWRF, should be minimized. The present work can offer a reference to design a new kind of vibrating machine with linear motion. In engineering, the desired linear motion vibration amplitude of MWRF can be reached by adjusting the parameters of vibrator and considering the theory condition of implementing linear motion.},

  abstract  = {As the proportion of renewable energy gradually increases, it brings challenges to the stable operation of the combined heat and power (CHP) system. As an important flexible resource, energy storage (ES) has attracted more and more attention. However, the profit of energy storage can’t make up for the investment and operation cost, and there is a lack of measurement system for multiple values, which seriously hinders the development of energy storage industry. Based on this, this paper makes a quantitative analysis on the system value of multiple energy storage in CHP. Firstly, the uncertain output of renewable energy is characterized by Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, and a two-level dispatching model is constructed based on the distributionally robust optimization method, so as to study the optimal operation strategy of the ES-CHP system. Secondly, based on the system value theory, this paper analyzes the system value of multiple energy storage, including internal value and external value, and constructs the value quantitative model, respectively. Finally, in a typical ES-CHP system, the system value of multiple energy storage is quantified. The effectiveness of the two-level model constructed in this paper can be seen from the simulation results, and the influence of different electricity prices on the system value of multiple energy storage is further analyzed.},

  abstract  = {We comprehensively studied directional feedback and feedforward connectivity to explore potential connectivity changes that underlie propofol-induced deep sedation. We further investigated the corticocortical connectivity patterns within and between hemispheres. Sixty-channel electroencephalographic data were collected from 19 healthy volunteers in a resting wakefulness state and propofol-induced deep unconsciousness state defined by a bispectral index value of 40. A source analysis was employed to locate cortical activity. The Desikan-Killiany atlas was used to partition cortices, and directional functional connectivity was assessed by normalized symbolic transfer entropy between higher-order (prefrontal and frontal) and lower-order (auditory, sensorimotor and visual) cortices and between hot-spot frontal and parietal cortices. We found that propofol significantly suppressed feedforward connectivity from the left parietal to right frontal cortex and bidirectional connectivity between the left frontal and left parietal cortex, between the frontal and auditory cortex, and between the frontal and sensorimotor cortex. However, there were no significant changes in either feedforward or feedback connectivity between the prefrontal and all the lower-order cortices and between the frontal and visual cortices or in feedback connectivity from the frontal to parietal cortex. Propofol anesthetic selectively decreased the unidirectional interaction between higher-order frontoparietal cortices and bidirectional interactions between the higher-order frontal cortex and lower-order auditory and sensorimotor cortices, which indicated that both feedback and feedforward connectivity were suppressed under propofol-induced deep sedation. Our findings provide critical insights into the connectivity changes underlying the top-down mechanism of propofol anesthesia at deep sedation.},

Wetlands and waters are main sources of QTP CH_4 emissions, but rising CH_4 emissions are partly offset by increased uptake by grasslands, suggesting that the QTP is a CH_4 source around 0.96 Tg CH_4-C yr^−^1. Warming on the QTP relieves temperature limitation and nitrogen limitation of alpine plant growth, driving increased plant growth; variable precipitation associated with warming regulates the warming effect through altering soil moisture. Sustainable grazing decreases aboveground biomass and increases soil respiration, but contributes to soil carbon and nitrogen stocks through biomass and nitrogen-rich excrement input into soils; this effect of grazing can be partly offset by warming. Heavy grazing and severe permafrost thaw drives substantial carbon and nitrogen loss through increased erosion and soil organic carbon mineralization, and decreased plant carbon input; climate change further strengthens this effect. Warming and human activities are affecting biogeochemical cycling on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. This Review examines the impacts on carbon and nitrogen cycling, detailing current stocks and changing fluxes. The Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has experienced atmospheric warming, cryosphere thaw and intensified human activities since the 1970s. These changes have had sometimes striking impacts on the hydrology, ecosystems and biogeochemistry of the region. In this Review, we describe carbon and nitrogen cycling on the QTP. Overall, the QTP has been a net carbon sink (with a net carbon balance of  44 million tons of carbon uptake per year) and a methane source ( 0.96 trillion grams per year of carbon in the form of methane, Tg CH_4-C yr^−1) since the 2000s. Rising temperatures, precipitation and nitrogen availability drive primary productivity increases, leading to increased carbon uptake. Conversely, these factors also increase greenhouse gas emissions, soil respiration rates and permafrost carbon mobilization, increasing carbon loss. Anthropogenic activities such as overgrazing and construction decrease plant production and soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, but restoration efforts on the QTP drive regional increases in these stocks. On balance, these changes are complex but largely offset each other. In the future, the QTP is predicted to still function as a net carbon sink, despite ongoing severe permafrost degradation. Moreover, nitrogen stocks are expected to remain relatively stable, partly related to potential future decreases in nitrogen deposition.},

The mass-transfer rates in the fuchsin gel and in model and real nutrient mediums are compared. The effect of gelatin on the optical properties of a two-component agarose-based gel is established, which allows reasonable assumptions about its structure. Based on the random-walk method, a numerical model for the propagation of model and real nutrient mediums in a gel is proposed. It is assumed that the model will make it possible to take into account the features of diffusion mass transfer in gels of various compositions. A comparison of the results of experiments and numerical simulation shows their good agreement.},

  abstract  = {Fluid discrimination is challenging for reservoir prediction, especially for tight sandstones with special petrophysical properties. In this paper, we first review the effective medium models that are widely used in seismic exploration and a variety of inversion methods and reservoir prediction strategies in reservoir prediction. Rock physics modeling takes an important role in reservoir prediction by linking petrophysical properties and elastic parameters. We also review the theoretical implications for different rock physics models that are based on the inclusion-based method, focusing specifically on the modeling workflow for conventional sand-shale reservoirs and two models for tight sandstones. The applicability of the conventional fluid substitution equations is analyzed in detail. Then, a new inclusion-based rock physics model for tight sandstones is proposed by considering the fluid pressure ratio between cracks and stiff pores. The proposed model helps to highlight the difference between different pores and present reasonable fluid information. In the application, a detailed prediction process for fluid discrimination is given, in which the Bayes posterior prediction framework is adopted to provide the maximum posterior probability solution and its posterior probability. Field data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Entrepreneurs make futures! To do so, they have to be confident in their role within an entrepreneurial group or they will be caught up in thinking about how the group should work together rather than drafting a future for the business. This is a key finding of the study put forward by Stamm and Gutzeit on the practice of imagining the future. Family members, friends, or former colleagues who jointly engage in an entrepreneurial venture form such a group, with its own history, structure, and culture. The authors’ qualitative study, based on group interviews, reveals that these group conditions influence the content of entrepreneurial visions. For entrepreneurship research, this study implies that an entrepreneurial vision is a product of group political processes rather than individual mental images. This study further implies that entrepreneurial groups and their advisors should reflect on group conditions before engaging in the drafting of an entrepreneurial vision. An essential part of entrepreneurial activity is the drafting and narrating of an entrepreneurial vision. This study is premised on the observation that entrepreneurial groups form an interaction arena for the practice of imagining the future and asks how the content of entrepreneurial visions is shaped by the conditions of the group. Taking an entrepreneurship-as-practice lens, which we enrich with sociological theory on the future (Beckert) and small groups (Fine), we engage in an in-depth case study of 12 entrepreneurial groups. We show how the content of entrepreneurial visions is configured by four elements (i.e., fictional expectation for the business or the group; future orientation that is continuing or divergent) and name two group conditions (i.e., role confidence and hierarchical congruence) that direct their configuration. We propose that lacking role confidence can impede thinking about the future of a business and that narrative hierarchies that challenge structural hierarchies can open a window for divergent future orientation. This study contributes to a novel theoretical understanding of where entrepreneurial visions come from by emphasizing politics of expectations within groups and calling to consider group conditions as a relevant context for entrepreneurial visions.},

First, a partial form dynamic linearization (PFDL) data model is established to address the unknown nonlinearities and nonaffine structure of the coupled MIMO system, in which all the complex uncertainties are compressed into a parameter matrix. Then, to mitigate the effect of packet dropouts and improve reliability during data transmission, the TDE protocol is utilized to encode the original signal into two identically important descriptions, which are then delivered to the decoders over two mutually independent channels. Finally, the convergence of the proposed TDE-based MFASMC scheme is strictly proved by the contraction mapping principle. The main merit of this method is that it is designed only using input–output (I/O) information instead of the knowledge of physical model. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by detailed simulations.},

  abstract  = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a technique within additive manufacturing that uses a high power density laser to build parts from fused powdered metal alloy. This technology is well equipped to produce complex parts with otherwise impossible features, such as hidden voids or lattice structures. Alongside capability, reliability and quality are key characteristics considered when choosing a manufacturing method, and these are gaining attention as this method becomes more prevalent in industry. One main indicator of a stable L-PBF process is consistent melt pool geometry, and the properties of which are likely to determine the quality of the part produced. As computing power and sensing technologies become more advanced, this melt pool geometry could be studied in real time. This work addresses the challenge by leveraging a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) model to identify key features within melt pool imagery and predict the energy density. The k-NN model was trained on data provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Data preprocessing was performed on the images to extract features that were used in the k-NN model. This approach was used to accurately infer the energy density of unseen layers within the same part. The algorithm was subsequently tested with unique scan strategies and found to reasonably estimate the energy density of different parts. A fivefold cross validation found the algorithm to be consistently predicting the class of 91.4},

  abstract  = {For fully actuated multi-agent systems (FAMASs), this paper presents a fault-tolerant formation control strategy grounded in a distributed predictive control framework. With the aid of the state information of neighbouring agents, a discrete distributed fault estimation observer is devised to accurately estimate actuator faults within the FAMASs. Subsequently, leveraging the high-order fully actuated characteristics of FAMAS and the obtained fault estimation information, a fully actuated system approach is employed to construct a fault-tolerant formation controller, which can mitigate the adverse impacts caused by actuator faults and the nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, the designed controller incorporates a predictive control element, derived by minimizing a cost function related to the multi-step-ahead prediction of formation errors and control inputs. This approach ensures the stability of the FAMAS formation while optimizing control performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven through its application to UAV formation.},

  abstract  = {In this study, the influence of aggregate sizes on the compressive strength (CS) of concrete system has been assessed. Accordingly, the fine aggregates (FA) and coarse aggregates (CA) with fixed gradation sizes were considered and the prepared conventional concrete samples were assessed for their 7th and 28th day compressive strength. Thereby, three different types of FA were selected for FA particle size gradation. Striking variations in the CS values were noted for the concrete samples with a particular combination of FA and CA sizes, and for a fixed choice of the water-to-cement ratio. Further investigations for the CS modelling are conducted with the response surface methodology (RSM). Considering overall specific gravity (FA Sp.Gr.) as a parameter but not a factor, the experimental design considered the FA size (in µm) and CA size (in mm) as independent variables. The best-fit RSM model analysis inferred the quadratic model with good relevance ( p  < 0.001) for the prediction CS in the defined factor space and for three alternate FA types. The Pareto plots revealed that while the FA size was the influential factor for both responses for the case of the FA Sp.Gr. value of 2.59, while CA size was the highest contributor for the other two FA Sp.Gr. types. Thereby, the role of the type of FA and the aggregate sizes were assessed to be very important to achieve the high CS. The adopted methodology is generic for selecting the best-fit control sample for further research into advanced concrete composite materials.},

  abstract  = {This study provides a comprehensive analysis of residual stress characteristics in nitinol parts fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). Unlike previous works that primarily focus on qualitative assessments or single-measurement techniques, this research employs a multi-modal experimental approach, Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry-Hole Drilling (ESPI-HD) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), to achieve a more precise and spatially resolved evaluation of residual stress distribution. Furthermore, the study establishes a direct correlation between residual stress evolution and in situ pyrometric melt pool temperature data, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior investigations. A key novel finding is the non-monotonic relationship between volumetric energy density (VED) and residual stress. In this work, laser power was kept constant, and VED was varied by adjusting scanning speed and hatch spacing. The results show that the average residual stress initially increases with decreasing scan speed and hatch spacing, plateaus at a critical threshold, and subsequently decreases. However, residual stress was also found to vary in the build direction, indicating the complex stress distributions and accommodation mechanisms within the material. Additionally, an inverse relationship was recorded between the thermal gradient and VED which challenges conventional assumptions about their relationship. These insights offer a new perspective on optimizing PBF-LB process parameters for enhanced structural performance and long-term reliability of additively manufactured nitinol.},

Enhanced accuracy in EV charging predictions could alleviate energy imbalances resulting from production and consumption disparities. Additionally, it supports SG architectural functions like demand response (DR) management. Compared to the initial baseline timeseries EV charging forecasting models, which performed poorly, the proposed strategy consists of a step-by-step forecasting methodology using data from predictions of road traffic, weather/seasonality, user charging information, and EV charging load. For each target, various novel implementations and models were conducted, including zero inflated (ZI) and a novel logarithmic ZI (LogZI) regression method. Results comparison indicated an increasing accuracy of EV charging demand forecasts from 78.1 to 88.7},

Due to the absence of a licensed vaccine, the current study was conceived to design a novel circular mRNA vaccine, capable of inducing an effective immune response by targeting the ZIKV proteins. Total 26 top-ranked epitopes (IC_50 ≤ 100 nM) were prioritized from the conserved regions of ZIKV proteins.

Molecular docking analysis revealed significant molecular interactions between the designed vaccine molecule and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), predicting an effective immune capability of the model vaccine. Molecular dynamics simulation validated the molecular and structural stability of the vaccine structure under physiological conditions.

A performance analysis shows good portability across x86 and ARM CPUs, GPUs from different vendors, and even two variants of Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs. Measuring the energy to solution shows that GPUs yield an up to 10x higher energy efficiency in terms of degrees of freedom per joule compared to CPUs.

  abstract  = {Immunotherapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers are limited by a lack of tumor-specific targets. Here we discover that RNA-binding proteins and glycosylated RNAs (glycoRNAs) form precisely organized nanodomains on cancer cell surfaces. We characterize nucleophosmin (NPM1) as an abundant cell surface protein (csNPM1) on a variety of tumor types. With a focus on AML, we observe csNPM1 on blasts and leukemic stem cells but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We develop a monoclonal antibody to target csNPM1, which exhibits robust anti-tumor activity in multiple syngeneic and xenograft models of AML, including patient-derived xenografts, without observable toxicity. We find that csNPM1 is expressed in a mutation-agnostic manner on primary AML cells and may therefore offer a general strategy for detecting and treating AML. Surface profiling and in vivo work also demonstrate csNPM1 as a target on solid tumors. Our data suggest that csNPM1 and its neighboring glycoRNA–cell surface RNA-binding protein (csRBP) clusters may serve as an alternative antigen class for therapeutic targeting or cell identification. An RNA-binding protein on leukemia cells provides an effective target in mouse models.},

  abstract  = {Due to random and uncertain market environment, financial assets exhibit long-term memory and jumps in price. This study employs a combination of fuzzy set theory, stochastic processes, and mixed fractional Brownian motion to effectively characterize the price process of financial derivatives. This study mainly introduces a novel model called the jump diffusion mixed fractional Brownian motion (JMFBM) model, which aims to accurately describe the dynamics of barrier option price. By solving the fuzzy partial differential equations driven by the JMFBM, one has successfully derived a pricing process for down-out barrier options. Significantly, numerical experiments are performed to address the influence of various parameters on option prices and examine the parameter sensitivity. Furthermore, to validate the feasibility and practicality of our results, empirical analysis is conducted using financial market data. The results show that the dynamics of fuzzy JMFBM is better suited for pricing financial derivatives in uncertain financial environments.},

  abstract  = {The automated processing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses a significant challenge due to their unstructured nature, rich in valuable, yet disorganized information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly Named Entity Recognition (NER), has been instrumental in extracting structured information from EHR data. However, existing literature primarly focuses on extracting handcrafted clinical features through NLP and NER methods without delving into their learned representations. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of these representations by considering their contextual richness and entity-specific information. Our proposed methodology extracts representations generated by a transformer-based NER model on EHRs data, combines them using a hierarchical attention mechanism, and employs the obtained enriched representation as input for a clinical prediction model. Specifically, this study addresses Overall Survival (OS) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) using unstructured EHRs data collected from an Italian clinical centre encompassing 838 records from 231 lung cancer patients. Whilst our study is applied on EHRs written in Italian, it serves as use case to prove the effectiveness of extracting and employing high level textual representations that capture relevant information as named entities. Our methodology is interpretable because the hierarchical attention mechanism highlights the information in EHRs that the model considers the most crucial during the decision-making process. We validated this interpretability by measuring the agreement of domain experts on the importance assigned by the hierarchical attention mechanism to EHRs information through a questionnaire. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing statistically significant improvements over traditional manually extracted clinical features.},

  abstract  = {Low childhood vaccination coverage is a major challenge in conflict-affected countries, including Yemen. Mobile vaccination teams have become a key strategy to improve vaccine uptake, but it remains unclear whether they make it easier for people to access vaccinations. We assessed the national and sub-national impact of mobile services on vaccination access in Yemen and identified optimal locations for expansion. Our findings show that mobile services enhance geographic access to childhood vaccinations, particularly for hard-to-reach populations. Additionally, scaling up services in targeted locations could further improve access, though some gaps would remain. These insights could inform national strategies to enhance vaccination coverage and broader primary healthcare access in Yemen and be adapted for use in other countries. Garber et al examine the impact of mobile programming on childhood vaccination access in Yemen using geospatial modelling and conflict-adjusted datasets. The modelling also identifies a set of optimal locations for new vaccination sites and quantifies their potential impact on vaccine accessibility. Background Childhood vaccination rates in Yemen remain alarmingly low, and recent political developments have restricted vaccine delivery. Understanding population access to vaccinations through existing delivery modalities, including fixed and mobile services, is critical to inform strategies to improve access, increase coverage, and prevent outbreaks. Methods We developed a geospatial model of national and subnational vaccination access via fixed health facilities and mobile health teams, using newly developed datasets accounting for conflict-related effects. We calculated travel times to fixed health facilities and mobile sites offering immunizations and estimated the number and percentage of the under-5 population with access to vaccines. We also conducted a scale-up model to identify and prioritize locations where additional mobile teams would most improve vaccination access. Results We estimate that in 2023, 66.3},

The speed and intensity can strongly impact both natural vegetation and crops, and the lack of predictability poses a major challenge to early warning systems. This study investigates the frequency, duration, speed, and severity of flash droughts for different Brazilian biomes over the period 1980–2020, based on time variation of soil  water storage estimated using daily gridded meteorological data and a high-resolution soil database. Results revealed that flash droughts are more frequent in the Caatinga, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. We identified differences among biomes in terms of duration, severity and speed of flash drought. Trend analysis indicated the intensification in speed and magnitude of flash drought mostly in eastern and northern Amazonia, southern and northern Cerrado, and in several spots of the Caatinga and the Atlantic forest biomes. Existent studies at a global scale have shown similar trends in Central Brazil, but some discrepancies in the case of the Amazon biome. The most likely explanation is that the occurrence of flash drought is closely related to the soil available water capacity, which was not mapped with high levels of detail in previous studies.},

  abstract  = {The paper introduces a novel image stitching method driven by the projection model, utilizing epipolar displacement field (EDF) to ensure geometric consistency in panoramic images. By leveraging the principles of epipolar geometry and infinite homography, this method ensures alignment accuracy and maintains global projectivity across stitched images. The process begins by establishing a pixel warping rule in epipolar geometry through the infinite homography. Then, the epipolar displacement field, which quantifies the displacement of pixels along the epipolar lines, is constructed using thin-plate splines derived from the principle of local elastic deformation. The final panoramic image is produced by inversely warping pixels according to the epipolar displacement field. This method integrates epipolar constraints into the warping rules, ensuring high-quality alignment and preserving projection accuracy. Comparative experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, show that the method effectively reduces parallax artifacts and maintains geometric fidelity, achieving an average SSIM of 0.928 and PSNR of 29.900 across 12 scenes, outperforming existing techniques.},

  abstract  = {With the emergence of autonomous vehicles comes the requirement of adequate and rigorous testing, particularly in critical scenarios that  are both challenging and potentially hazardous. Generating synthetic simulation-based critical scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles has therefore received considerable interest, yet it is unclear how such scenarios relate to the actual crash or near-crash scenarios  in the real world. Consequently, their realism is unknown. In this paper, we define realism as the degree of similarity of synthetic critical scenarios to real-world critical scenarios. We propose a methodology to measure realism using two metrics, namely attribute distribution and Euclidean distance. The methodology extracts various attributes from synthetic and realistic critical scenario datasets and performs a set of statistical tests to compare their distributions and distances. As a proof of concept for our methodology, we compare synthetic collision scenarios from DeepScenario against realistic autonomous vehicle collisions collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles in California, to analyse how well DeepScenario synthetic collision scenarios are aligned with real autonomous vehicle collisions recorded in California. We focus on five key attributes that are extractable from both datasets, and analyse the attribution distribution and distance between scenarios in the two datasets. Further, we derive recommendations to improve the realism of synthetic scenarios based on our analysis. Our study of realism provides a framework that can be replicated and extended for other dataset both concerning real-world and synthetically-generated scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Enhancement of low-light images is a challenging process since it considers brightness recovery, noise, and distortion. The images captured in low light conditions degrade the image quality and increase the complexity of future computer vision processes. To solve this problem, this work presents an improved deep learning-based image enhancement model for low-light images. This process goes through three main phases: image decomposition, noise reduction and image enhancement. Initially, the low-quality images from the datasets are decomposed using residual layers in the residual network, which obtain illumination maps by decomposing low-light images. After decomposing the images, the denoising process is carried out by using the attention U-Net model, which is used to suppress the noise and achieve better-quality images. Finally, the improvement network is employed to boost the images’ contrast and brightness. This enhancement network includes a convolution and deconvolution layer that handles feature map information from low-light images. Finally, May Flame algorithm optimization is used to reduce the loss function and improve the quality of the images. The performance metrics such as peak signal noise ratio (PSNR), similarity index measure (SSIM), Natural image quality evaluator (NIQE), Lightness Order Error (LOE), Optimal Scale Selection, OSS-PSNR, Universal Quality Index (UQI) will be computed and compared with the recent techniques. The proposed model can obtain PSNR values of 21.06, SSIM range of 0.9456, UQI range of 0.9874, LOE values of 241.86 and NIQE of 16.16. Thus, the proposed model is more efficient than other existing models.},

  abstract  = { 100,000 copies of plant circadian clock proteins per cell were predicted from RNA levels and included in detailed models. Protein levels and DNA-binding were validated, using NanoLUC reporters in vivo, and the methods extended to sequence variants. Many data types, including biophysical data for CCA1/LHY and LUX, are now interpretable within the framework of mechanistic clock models with faithful biochemical representation, U2019 and U2020. Dynamic, timeseries data with the first absolute quantification of plant clock protein copy numbers were readily accessible using protein fusions to the NanoLUC reporter in transgenic plants. The bulk dynamics of plant clock proteins was largely predictable from their RNA abundance but the activity of CCA1/LHY and TOC1 repressors is regulated by mechanisms beyond current models. Computational models of clock protein-DNA binding that incorporate absolute units can go beyond the genotype to phenotype map, to include genome sequence variants for the first time. Understanding the biochemistry behind whole-organism traits such as flowering time is a longstanding challenge, where mathematical models are critical. Very few models of plant gene circuits use the absolute units required for comparison to biochemical data. We refactor two detailed models of the plant circadian clock from relative to absolute units. Using absolute RNA quantification, a simple model predicted abundant clock protein levels in Arabidopsis thaliana , up to 100,000 proteins per cell. NanoLUC reporter protein fusions validated the predicted levels of clock proteins in vivo. Recalibrating the detailed models to these protein levels estimated their DNA-binding dissociation constants ( K _ d ). We estimate the same K _ d from multiple results in vitro, extending the method to any promoter sequence. The detailed models simulated the K _ d range estimated from LUX DNA-binding in vitro but departed from the data for CCA1 binding, pointing to further circadian mechanisms. Our analytical and experimental methods should transfer to understand other plant gene regulatory networks, potentially including the natural sequence variation that contributes to evolutionary adaptation.  100,000 copies of plant circadian clock proteins per cell were predicted from RNA levels and included in detailed models.

  abstract  = {Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in applications such as traffic monitoring systems and maritime rescue. However, existing IRSTD methods face challenges due to their reliance on a single type of data, making them susceptible to noise and deficient in contextual understanding. Additionally, small and limited datasets hinder model generalization and performance in complex scenarios. Previous methods are mostly based on U-Net architectures that are optimized for small-scale data and involve intricate design. These designs often perform well in specific scenarios, but they struggle to generalize effectively in real-world applications. Inspired by leading vision-language models, we propose an MIRSAM (Multimodal Vision-Language Segment Anything Model for Infrared Small Target Detection), the first framework to integrate text modality with image modality for IRSTD in this article. Given the differences in noise and structural information between infrared and natural images, we fine-tune segment anything model (SAM) by designing a contourlet denoising adapter module (CDAM). Integrated into SAM’s image encoder, this module suppresses noise during feature extraction and encoding, enabling efficient adaptation to the infrared domain. To incorporate textual information, we utilize the text encoder of contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to convert text into high-dimensional feature vectors, which then serve as prompts to extract relevant details from the features. In addition, we build the first multimodal IRSTD dataset, IR-TXPair, containing image-text pairs. Experiments on the newly constructed IR-TXPair dataset demonstrate that the proposed MIRSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {We present a framework for evaluating language workbenches’ capabilities for co-evolution of graphical modeling languages, modeling tools and models. As with programming, maintenance tasks such as language refinement and enhancement typically account for more work than the initial development phase. Modeling languages have the added challenge of keeping tools and existing models in step with the evolving language. As domain-specific modeling languages and tools have started to be used widely, thanks to reports of significant productivity improvements, some language workbench users have indeed reported problems with co-evolution of tools and models. Our tool-agnostic evaluation framework aims to cover changes across the whole language definition: the abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and constraints. Change impact is assessed for knock-on effects within the language definition, the modeling tools, semantics via generators, and existing models. We demonstrate the viability of the framework by evaluating MetaEdit+, EMF/Sirius and Jjodel, providing a detailed evaluation process for others to repeat with their tools. The results of the evaluation show differences among the tools: from editors not opening correctly or at all, through highlighting of items requiring manual intervention, to fully automatic updates of languages, models and editors. We call for industry to evaluate their tool choices with the framework, tool developers to extend their tool support for co-evolution, and researchers to refine the evaluation framework and evaluations presented.},

  abstract  = {Metamodels are cornerstone in MDE. They define the different domain concepts and the relations between them. A metamodel is also used to generate concrete artifacts such as code. Developers then rely on the generated code to build their language services and tooling, e.g., editors, checkers. To check the behavior of their client code, developers write or generate unit tests. As metamodels evolve between releases, the generated code is automatically updated. As a consequence, the additional developers’ code is impacted and is co-evolved accordingly for each release. However, there is no guarantee that the co-evolution of the code is performed correctly. One way to do so is to rerun all the tests after each code co-evolution, which is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes an automatic solution for tracing impacted tests due to metamodel evolution. Thus, we end up matching metamodel changes with impacted code methods and their corresponding tests in both the original and evolved versions of a given project. After that, we map the two versions of the impacted tests and compare them to analyze the behavior of the code before and after its evolution due to the metamodel evolution. In particular, we implemented an Eclipse plug-in that allows tracing, mapping, execution, and reporting back the results to the developers for easier in-depth analysis of the effect of metamodel evolutions rather than analyzing the whole test suite. We first ran a user study experiment to gain evidence on the difficulty or not of the manual task of tracing impacted tests. We found that manually tracing the tests impacted by the evolution of the metamodel is a hard and error-prone task. Not only the participants could not trace all tests, but they even wrongly traced non-impacted tests. We then evaluated our approach on 18 Eclipse projects from OCL, Modisco, Papyrus, and EMF over several evolved versions of metamodels. For the 14 projects without manual tests, we generated a test suite for each release with the state-of-the-art tool EvoSuite. The results show that we successfully traced the impacted tests automatically by selecting 1608 out of 34,612 tests due to 473 metamodel changes. When running the traced tests before and after co-evolution, we observed cases indicating possibly both behaviorally correct and incorrect code co-evolution. Finally, we reached gains representing, on average, a reduction of 88},

Here, we describe how this process, and the validation of the resulting interface connections, can be made simpler, faster, and more reliable. Especially when, as is often the case, several individuals or teams collaborate on modeling and simulating a full system. This is achieved by grouping functional mock-up interface (FMI) variables into types close to the relevant engineering domains using semantics formalized as an ontology. Several benefits, we argue, are gained from this: clearer communication, increased validation potential, and reduced number of interface connections to deal with. The validity and the limitations of our approach are demonstrated with a detailed case study of a real maritime system: A dynamic positioning (DP) hardware controller connected to several independent co-simulation models via 156 variables in 78 connections. The proposed solution greatly reduces the complexities and the error potential related to interfacing such systems.

Different approaches, such as trading ratio systems (TRS), offer economic incentives for reducing pollutant discharges and promote cost-effective compliance with water quality standards. This study evaluates the impact of equitable initial permit allocation on the willingness of dischargers to engage in trading and examines its effect on abatement cost savings within a TRS framework for riverine water quality management. The methodology combines a multi-objective optimization model with the Streeter-Phelps simulation to assess permit allocation and trading scenarios in the Sefidrood River. The model was calibrated and validated using 58 years of historical data, generating Pareto front curves for objective functions across three periods with progressively stricter water quality standards. According to the optimization results, equitable permit allocation significantly influenced trading behavior and cost efficiency. Equitable initial permit allocation led to significant reductions in total abatement costs: 58},

Building on previous efforts, we introduce an updated 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear aerodynamic model and its linearized form. The key features of this work include the model’s identification in the stability frame, achieved using estimated angle of attack and sideslip angle, and the use of a propulsion system model to obtained the motor speed data. The stability frame parameterization allows for direct comparisons with a larger set of UAV models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, often presented in terms of lift and drag analysis. Key advancements include a residual distribution analysis that was successfully applied to identify and correct weaknesses in the initial drag and side force models. Additionally, the paper addresses the unique combination of challenges faced during this study and describes strategies for managing strong winds during experiments, use of a propulsion system model to obtain motor speed data, and utilization of estimated aerodynamic angles. The resulting model is validated against a separate set of maneuvers comprising 10-s-long sequences that include estimated body states, force and moment coefficients, and estimated air data states, (

  abstract  = {Theories of dynamic decision-making are typically built on evidence accumulation, which is modeled using racing accumulators or diffusion models that track a shifting balance of support over time. However, these two types of models are only two special cases of a more general evidence accumulation process where options correspond to directions in an accumulation space. Using this generalized evidence accumulation approach as a starting point, I identify four ways to discriminate between absolute-evidence and relative-evidence models. First, an experimenter can look at the information that decision-makers considered to identify whether there is a filtering of near-zero evidence samples, which is characteristic of a relative-evidence decision rule (e.g., diffusion decision model). Second, an experimenter can disentangle different components of drift rates by manipulating the discriminability of the two response options relative to the stimulus to delineate the balance of evidence from the total amount of evidence. Third, a modeler can use machine learning to classify a set of data according to its generative model. Finally, machine learning can also be used to directly estimate the geometric relationships between choice options. I illustrate these different approaches by applying them to data from an orientation-discrimination task, showing converging conclusions across all four methods in favor of accumulator-based representations of evidence during choice. These tools can clearly delineate absolute-evidence and relative-evidence models, and should be useful for comparing many other types of decision theories.},

  abstract  = {A full duplex (FD) communication system is a promising technology for 5G wireless applications for enhancing spectral efficiency (SE). This can be achieved by introducing pre-coders into the massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) models. In this research, an uplink and downlink system-based two-way communication is emphasized for high-speed and efficient communication technology. Usually, the spectral efficiency of the uplink and downlink channel state information (CSI) is evaluated based on linear pre-coding techniques. Spectral efficiency (SE) is an essential aspect of assessing a massive MIMO system. This work presents an enhanced honey badger multi-cell minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection (EHBM3SED) model for uplink transmission in the full-duplex MIMO model. During uplink transmission, the MIMO system’s performance is degraded by high interference that arises among the cells. To overcome the intra and inter-cell interference, the hybrid block diagonalization (BD) and QR decomposition process is utilized. In addition, the zero forcing (ZF) pre-coder model is introduced for downlink transmission in the FD massive MIMO (FD-M-MIMO) model. The model’s spectrum efficiency is enhanced by the use of a spectral efficient honey badger optimization (SEHBO) model, which controls the power on the transmission channel. The Proposed model is implemented in the MATLAB platform, and the performance analysis is conducted and compared with existing methods. The model achieved an SE of 361.76bps/Hz for 300 antennas and 387.34bps/Hz for 45 dB transmitted power.},

  abstract  = {There are strict constraints of vehicle location and running time in trajectory tracking. When a self-driving vehicle with a two-dimensional tracking strategy drives on ramps, the demand trajectory will be lengthened due to the existence of road slope, resulting in low tracking accuracy. Moreover, the existing techniques are difficult to cope with sudden changes in road adhesion. Here we discuss a series of studies on trajectory tracking control with the consideration of road slope and adhesion condition. A tridimensional vehicle kinematics model is constructed, based on which a basic tracking controller is designed to adjust front wheel steering angle. The obtained vehicle speed is not directly applied to the self-driving vehicle, but is sent as a control target to a motor torque command controller based on a constructed longitudinal vehicle dynamics model. In this process, the control of slip ratio is taken into account to prevent wheels from being locked by regulating the torque command. The two controllers are linked by the vehicle speed. Some comparative tests are carried out by a software-in-loop experimental platform. The test results demonstrate that the adaptability of the self-driving vehicle to the road slope and adhesion variation during the trajectory tracking can be improved.},

  abstract  = {A key factor influencing the economic efficiency of a forging process is time. To be competitive, organisational, administrative aspects, and decisions on content design must be clarified in the shortest possible time. The development of a forging process includes the creation of a so-called forging sequence plan, in which an initial body (semi-finished product) is successively brought into a target shape. As a rule, the stages are designed iteratively by calculating backwards to the semi-finished product (cylinder, cuboid, etc.). Therefore, automation solutions offer great potential for significantly reducing the iterative effort. In a multi-stage forging sequence plan, the first stage after the semi-finished product is called the preform. The preform has a significant influence on the amount of flash, number of stages and various forming parameters (e. g. forming load). Suitably designed preforms can therefore lead to a reduction in the number of stages. Rolling processes, for example, are suitable for creating preforms. The method presented here shows how mass-optimized preforms can be designed automatically for cross-wedge and non-circular rolling processes. This approach offers the advantage that forming processes do not have to be designed exclusively by backward iteration. Parameters or machine limits then can be used to calculate the following intermediate forms, thereby reducing the number of iterations needed.},

Here we develop a light-controlled programming strategy for biological active matter to construct micrometre-scale fluid flow fields for transport, separation and mixing. We circumvent nonlinear dynamic effects within the active fluids by limiting hydrodynamic interactions between contracting motor–filament networks patterned with light. Using a predictive model, we design and apply flow fields to accomplish canonical microfluidic tasks such as transporting and separating cell clusters, probing the extensional rheology of polymers and giant lipid vesicles and generating mixing flows at low Reynolds numbers.

Due to limited cost, existing periodic maintenance focused on observing surface damage and paying less attention to dynamic response in operation. Therefore, a measurement system based on a smartphone for full-field deformation of the bridge was introduced. Firstly, many vision-based methods for multiple bridge members measurement were proposed and the accuracy of methods was verified through laboratory and field experiments. With the combination of template matching and feature detection methods, the displacements of the deck were measured with an error of less than 0.3},

In light of the reality that decision-makers exhibit varying sensitivities to compensation expectations in response to opinion adjustment, the moderator’s demonstration of a preferred compensation mechanism determines the efficiency of the matching service. This article proposes a dynamic cost compensation mechanism driven by moderator preferences for group consensus in lending platforms. Firstly, the utility function describes adjusters’ preferences, defining three unit cost compensation preferences: Power-type I, II and right-partial S-shaped preferences. Subsequently, we construct a generalized dynamic minimum-cost consensus decision model to determine the optimal unit compensation strategies within the opinion interval delineated by the moderator. For the likelihood of equitable concerns arising from fluctuations in unit compensation costs, we enforce the fairness of the compensation strategy by incorporating the Gini coefficient as a constraint within the consensus model. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed models, we apply the proposed models to online lending utilizing data obtained from an online peer-to-peer lending platform.},

This study investigates the influence of disc-cutter partial wear on tunneling parameters and proposes a novel method for discriminating partial-wear ratio based on a stacking ensemble model. The time-domain features of torque and thrust, including the average value and standard deviation, are analyzed through a series of scaled-down experimental tests on partial wear. Torque and thrust values will increase when a disc cutter is trapped and partially worn. The impact of partial-wear ratio on tunneling parameters appears to be more significant than partial-wear depth. A total of 40 features are selected from the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain to describe the torque and thrust. The relationships between these features and the partial-wear ratio are analyzed using the Pearson coefficient and Copula entropy. The results reveal that, except for the form factor in the time-domain features, the remaining features exhibit certain linear or non-linear correlations with the partial-wear ratio. Lastly, the proposed model successfully achieves the discrimination of the partial-wear ratio and outperforms other commonly used models in terms of overall classification accuracy and differentiation capability in different categories. This research provides effective support for monitoring and health management of disc-cutter failure states.},

  abstract  = {Corn seed breeding is a global issue, and has attracted great attention in recent years. Deploying autonomous robots for corn kernel recognition and classification has great potential in terms of constructing environmentally friendly agriculture, and saving manpower. Existing segmentation methods that utilize U-shaped architectures typically operate by processing images in discrete pixel-based segments. This approach often overlooks the finer pixel-level structural details within these segments, leading to models that struggle to preserve the continuity of target edges effectively. In this paper, we propose a new framework for corn seed image segmentation, called VMUnet-MSADI, which aims to integrate MSADI module into the encoder and decoder of the VMUnet architecture. Our VMUnet-MSADI model benefits from self-attention computation in VMUnet and multi-scale coding to effectively model non-local dependencies and context relationships at the scale layer, thus improving the segmentation quality of different images. Unlike previous Unet-based improvement schemes, the proposed VMUnet-MSADI adopts a multiscale convolutional attention module coding mechanism at the depth level and an efficient multiscale deep convolutional decoder at the spatial level to extract coarse-grained features and fine-grained features at different semantic scales and effectively avoid the loss of information at the target boundary to improve the quality and accuracy of target segmentation. We introduce a Visual State Space (VSS) block to capture a wide range of contextual information and a Detail Infusion Block (DIB) to enhance the fusion of low-level and high-level features, which further fills in the remote contextual information during the up-sampling process. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on open-source datasets and the results demonstrate that the VMUnet-MSADI model excels in the task of corn kernel segmentation. The model achieved a segmentation accuracy of 95.96},

This study develops a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to validate the interplay between Lean practices and Industry 4.0 in driving operational improvements in the heavy fabrication industry. A survey gathered responses from 70 experts across Indian heavy fabrication companies implementing these paradigms. The model includes seven constructs—Shop Floor Operations, Employee Skills, Workplace Culture, Design Development, Customer–Supplier Feedback, Operational Performance, and Business Performance—with 24 associated indicators. Hypotheses linking these constructs were tested using Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM). Results confirmed strong correlations, with Operational and Business Performance showing significant dependency on Customer–Supplier Feedback and Workplace Culture (correlation values: 0.965 and 0.918, respectively). Employee Skills emerged as the most influential factor for Business Performance (importance: 0.802), while Design Development showed the highest performance (value: 67.36). The findings highlight the synergistic benefits of integrating Lean and Industry 4.0, providing actionable insights for industry leaders to enhance organizational efficiency and competitiveness.

Domain-adaptive language models, which are trained with a specific domain corpus, exhibit high performance in their target domains. However, pre-training these models with a large amount of domain-specific data requires a substantial computational budget and resources, necessitating the development of efficient pre-training methods. In this paper, we propose a novel subset selection method called AlignSet, which extracts an informative subset from a given domain dataset for efficient pre-training. Our goal is to extract an informative subset that enables faster learning of the language model compared to learning from the entire dataset. By experiments across multiple domains, we demonstrate that AlignSet generates better subsets than other methods.},

  abstract  = {The gravitational field of a planetary body is most often modeled by an exterior spherical harmonic series, which is uniformly convergent outside the smallest mass-enclosing sphere centered at the origin of the coordinate system, known as the Brillouin sphere. The model can become unstable inside the spherical boundary. Rarely deliberated or emphasized is an obvious fact that the radius of the Brillouin sphere, which is the maximum radius coordinate of the body, changes with the origin. The sphere can thus be adjusted to fit a certain convex portion of irregular body shape via an appropriate coordinate translation, thereby maximizing the region of model stability above the body. We demonstrate that it is, while perhaps counterintuitive, rational to displace the coordinate origin from the center of figure, or even off the body entirely. We review concisely the theory and a method of spherical harmonic translation. We consider some textbook examples that illuminate the physical meaning and the practical advantage of the transformation, the discussion of which, as it turns out, is not so easily encountered. We provide seminormalized as well as fully normalized version of the algorithms, which are compact and easy to work with for low-degree applications. At little cost, the proposed approach enables the spherical harmonics to be comparable with the far more complicated ellipsoidal harmonics in performance in the case of two small objects, Phobos and 433 Eros.},

The SWAT-MODLFOW model, developed on the QSWATMOD2 platform, was validated using river runoff data and groundwater level observations. Consequently, the delay of precipitation on groundwater levels and the correlation between surface water and groundwater dynamics in the middle and lower portions of the Songhua River basin were modeled. The findings indicate: (1) The coefficient of calibration and Nash coefficient for monthly runoff during the calibration and validation periods yielded R^2 ≥ 0.86, NSE ≥ 0.87, R^2 ≥ 0.76, and NSE ≥ 0.77, respectively. Furthermore, the discrepancy between the simulated and actual groundwater table values is within 0.6 m, with R² values of 0.97 and 0.98 for the periodic and verification phases, respectively. The simulation outcomes of this test model are satisfactory and fulfill the criteria for scientific research. (2) The groundwater level in the research area typically declines from west-northwest to northeast and from south to east.

Here, the coordination of commodities, parts and labour design the problems and produce the training sets from which ‘solutions’ can be synthesised. But to what extent might synthetic media, surfacing via platforms such as Midjourney and OpenAI, be understood as logistical media? This paper charts a selective genealogy of synthetic media from early attempts to synthesise human sensory capacities in order to cybernetically integrate them into computational circuits. We see this integration as a pre-emption of their (computational) logistical coordination. It then details media experiments with ‘ChatFOS’, a GPT-based bot tasked with developing a logistics design business. Using its prompt-generated media outputs, we assemble a simulation and parody of AI’s emerging functionalities within logistical worlds. In the process, and with ‘human-in-the-loop’ stitching, we illustrate how large language models become media managers overseeing image prompts, graphical design, website code, promotional copy and investor pitch scenarios. The processes and methods of producing speculative scenarios via ChatFOS lead us to consider how the media of logistics and the logistics of media are increasingly enfolded. We ask: what can a (practice-based) articulation of this double-becoming of logistics and synthetic mediality tell us about the politics and aesthetics of contemporary computation and capital?},

Most of the surveyed SMEs are part of the already adopted group. The distinctions among the groups were predicated on four indicators. The lack of cooperativeness of all members of SMEs and the lack of upkeep and maintenance costs allocated by SMEs to adopt digital technology are the most influential barriers to achieving a higher level of digital technology adoption. The practical consequences of this research include the management or owners of SMEs and policymakers prioritizing helping all members of SMEs and allocating funds to enhance their degree of digital technology readiness.

  abstract  = {Flapping wing air vehicles (FWAVs) are a type of bio-inspired aerial robot, whose application potential is currently receiving significant attention. However, the dynamic modeling techniques for flapping motion remain underdeveloped, particularly for bird-sized FWAVs. Traditional quasi-steady (QS) models’ accuracy heavily relies on empirical coefficients, leading to unacceptable errors when analyzing flapping motion at different scales and wing flexibilities. Some improved reduced-order models also struggle to describe the effects caused by irregular flexible deformations of the wing surface. This paper presents an improved QS model that incorporates the interaction mechanism between wing flexible deformation and relative flow state, enabling quantitative analysis of wing deformation’s aerodynamic influence and significantly reducing reliance on empirical coefficients. The model comprises two solvers: the dynamic solver that calculates the corresponding aerodynamic loads based on the deformation state of the wing surface, and the structural solver that determines the new deformation state based on the load distribution on the wing surface. In each iteration cycle, these solvers exchange their output data until they converge to a stable wing surface displacement distribution and output the predicted aerodynamic data. Wind tunnel experiments, utilizing high-speed cameras and six-dimensional force sensors, validated the reliability of both the structural solver and the dynamic solver. This aerodynamic model, balancing efficiency and accuracy, shows strong potential for applications in FWAVs’ structural and controller design, including but not limited to airfoil optimization and flight attitude stabilization.},

  abstract  = {Land use regression (LUR) models are one of the standard methods for estimating air pollution concentration in urban areas. These models are usually low accurate due to inappropriate stochastic models (weight matrix). Furthermore, the measurement or modeling of dependent and independent variables used in LUR models is affected by various errors, which indicates the need to use an efficient stochastic and functional model to achieve the best estimation. This study proposes a locally weighted total least-squares variance component estimation (LW-TLS-VCE) for modeling urban air pollution. In the proposed method, in the first step, a locally weighted total least-squares (LW-TLS) regression is developed to simultaneously considers the non-stationary effects and errors of dependent and independent variables. In the second step, the variance components of the stochastic model are estimated to achieve the best linear unbiased estimation of unknowns. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by modeling PM_2.5 concentrations via meteorological, land use, and traffic variables in Isfahan, Iran. The benefits provided by the proposed method, including considering non-stationary effects and random errors of all variables, besides estimating the actual variance of observations, are evaluated by comparing four consecutive methods. The obtained results demonstrate that using a suitable stochastic and functional model will significantly increase the proposed method’s efficiency in PM_2.5 modeling.},

Traditional and long-established model systems rarely reproduce either tissue complexity or human physiology faithfully; these shortcomings underscore the need for better models. Organoids represent a promising research model, helping us gain a more profound understanding of the digestive organs; this model can also be used to provide patients with precise and individualized treatment and to build rapid in vitro test models for drug screening or gene/cell therapy, linking basic research with clinical treatment. Over the past few decades, the use of organoids has led to an advanced understanding of the composition of each digestive organ and has facilitated disease modeling, chemotherapy dose prediction, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic intervention, high-throughput drug screening, and identification of SARS-CoV-2 targets, pathogenic infection. However, the existing organoids of the digestive system mainly include the epithelial system. In order to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of digestive diseases, it is necessary to establish a completer and more physiological organoid model. Combining organoids and advanced techniques to test individualized treatments of different formulations is a promising approach that requires further exploration. This review highlights the advancements in the field of organoid technology from the perspectives of disease modeling and personalized therapy.},

  abstract  = {Warming of northern high latitude regions (NHL, > 50 °N) has increased both photosynthesis and respiration which results in considerable uncertainty regarding the net carbon dioxide (CO_2) balance of NHL ecosystems. Using estimates constrained from atmospheric observations from 1980 to 2017, we find that the increasing trends of net CO_2 uptake in the early-growing season are of similar magnitude across the tree cover gradient in the NHL. However, the trend of respiratory CO_2 loss during late-growing season increases significantly with increasing tree cover, offsetting a larger fraction of photosynthetic CO_2 uptake, and thus resulting in a slower rate of increasing annual net CO_2 uptake in areas with higher tree cover, especially in central and southern boreal forest regions. The magnitude of this seasonal compensation effect explains the difference in net CO_2 uptake trends along the NHL vegetation- permafrost gradient. Such seasonal compensation dynamics are not captured by dynamic global vegetation models, which simulate weaker respiration control on carbon exchange during the late-growing season, and thus calls into question projections of increasing net CO_2 uptake as high latitude ecosystems respond to warming climate conditions. The northern high latitude permafrost region has been an important contributor to the carbon sink since the 1980s. A new study finds that as tree cover increases, respiratory CO2 loss during late-growing season offsets photosynthetic CO2 uptake and leads to a slower rate of increasing annual net CO2 uptake.},

  abstract  = {In practice, a vital challenge problem is how to accurately evaluate the failure probability of rare events with a minimum of samples. Although adaptive Kriging combined with truncated importance sampling (AK-TIS) provides a viable method to address this problem, unsatisfied samples are often added in Kriging modeling and thereby result in an unacceptable computing burden. To efficiently acquire best-desired samples and reduce the calls of real limit state function (LSF), a moving-zone renewal (MZR) strategy-based AK-TIS (MZR-AK-TIS) approach is proposed. By dividing the whole large candidate sampling pool into several small sub-candidate sampling pools, the MZR strategy can ceaselessly find desired samples and update the Kriging model as the moving of the sub-sampling pool. MZR-AK-TIS not only inherits the advantages of AK-TIS but also reduces its computing time in two aspects. One is the size reduction of the candidate sampling pool in each sub-zone, and the other is the reduction of the call number of real LSF since the samples outside the sub-sampling pool do not need to participate in Kriging updating. The proposed method is verified by several numerical cases and applied to the aeroengine variable stator vane mechanism. The analysis results demonstrate that MZR-AK-TIS holds the potential to reduce the computing cost while ensuring accuracy in rare event analysis.},

Electrolyte engineering advances Li metal batteries (LMBs) with high Coulombic efficiency (CE) by constructing LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, the low conductivity of LiF disturbs Li^+ diffusion across SEI, thus inducing Li^+ transfer-driven dendritic deposition. In this work, we establish a mechanistic model to decipher how the SEI affects Li plating in high-fluorine electrolytes. The presented theory depicts a linear correlation between the capacity loss and current density to identify the slope k (determined by Li^+ mobility of SEI components) as an indicator for describing the homogeneity of Li^+ flux across SEI, while the intercept dictates the maximum CE that electrolytes can achieve. This model inspires the design of an efficient electrolyte that generates dual-halide SEI to homogenize Li^+ distribution and Li deposition. The model-driven protocol offers a promising energetic analysis to evaluate the compatibility of electrolytes to Li anode, thus guiding the design of promising electrolytes for LMBs.},

  abstract  = {The growth of network-based computing devices and the development of massive services are both results of the Internet of Things (IoT) by deploying Internet-connected devices at the edge. These devices are limited in terms of storage and computing, where the resources they need are provided by the cloud computing paradigm. Unfortunately, the two-tier cloud-IoT architecture is not efficient enough to provide the resources needed for latency-sensitive applications. Consequently, Fog Computing Paradigm (FCP) has been proposed to complement cloud computing and support such IoT-generated applications at the network edge. Heterogeneity, geographical distribution, and large-scale of fog nodes need the development of new methodologies for deploying and running IoT applications on fog nodes. A collection of IoT services, which have varying Quality of Service (QoS) needs, make up applications for the IoT, so finding an autonomous IoT Fog Service Placement (IoT-FSP) scheme in such an infrastructure can be challenging. The current study presents a distributed conceptual computing framework to address this problem. It is based on an autonomous approach, which improves resource management in three-tier cloud-fog-IoT architecture. Besides, we use the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) as a meta-heuristic approach to efficiently solve the FSP. We refer to the proposed strategy as the FSP-COA. The FSP-COA formulates the problem as a multi-objective problem to reconcile various objectives, including SLA violations, service latency, response time, fog utilization, service cost, and energy consumption. Finally, the performance of FSP-COA is evaluated compared to state-of-the-art algorithms using the iFogSim simulator. According to experiments, FSP-COA is more efficient than other algorithms regarding various metrics, including latency, energy and cost, and on average, outperforms the better of existing algorithms ranging from 4},

  abstract  = {This paper lays out a hierarchical, appropriate-complexity framework for conceptualizing movement-path segments at different spatiotemporal scales in a way that facilitates comparative analyses and bridges behavior and mathematical concepts. It then outlines a process for generating a multimode, multiscale stochastic simulation model that can be used to test animal movement hypotheses and make predictions of movement responses to management and global change. Many methods for analyzing movement data begin by generating step-length (SL) and turning-angle (TA) distributions from relocation time-series data, some of which are linked to ecological, landscape, and environmental covariates. The frequency at which these data are collected may vary from sub-seconds to several hours. The kinds of questions that may be asked of these data, however, are very much scale dependent. The hierarchical path-segmentation (HPS) framework presented here clarifies how the scale at which SL and TA data are collected relates to other sub- and super-diel scales. Difficulties arise because the information contained in SL and TA time series are often not directly relatable to the physiological, ecological, and sociological factors that drive the structure of movement paths at longer scales. These difficulties are overcome by anchoring the classification of movement types around the concept of fixed-period (24 h) diel activity routines and providing a bridge between behavioral/ecological and stochastic-walk concepts (means, variances, correlations, individual-state and local environmental covariates). This bridge is achieved through the generation of relatively short segments conceived as characteristic sequences of fundamental movement elements. These short segments are then used to characterize longer canonical-activity-mode segments that emerge through movement at behaviorally relevant sub-diel scales. HPS thus provides a novel system for integrating sub-minute movement sequences into canonical activity modes (CAMs) that, in turn, can be strung together into various types of diel activity routines (DARs). These DARs both vary among individuals within a given day, and for any given individual across time and under the influence of landscape factors. An understanding of how DARs are influenced by environmental inputs will help us predict the response of supra-diel lifetime movement phases (LiMPs) of individuals, as well as their complete lifetime tracks (LiTs), to anthropogenically induced global change.},

  abstract  = {The simulation and planning system (SPS) requires accurate and real-time feedback regarding the deformation of soft tissues during the needle insertion procedure. Traditional mechanical-based models such as the finite element method (FEM) are widely used to compute the deformations of soft tissue. However, it is difficult for the FEM or other methods to find a balance between an acceptable image fidelity and real-time deformation feedback due to their complex material properties, geometries and interaction mechanisms. In this paper, a Kriging-based method is applied to model the soft tissue deformation to strike a balance between the accuracy and efficiency of deformation feedback. Four combinations of regression and correlation functions are compared regarding their ability to predict the maximum deformations of ten characteristic markers at a fixed insertion depth. The results suggest that a first order regression function with Gaussian correlation functions can best fit the results of the ground truth. The functional response of the Kriging-based method is utilized to model the dynamic deformations of markers at a series of needle insertion depths. The feasibility of the method is verified by investigating the adaptation to step variations. Compared with the ground truth of the finite element (FE) results, the maximum residual is less than 0.92 mm in the Y direction and 0.31 mm in the X direction. The results suggest that the Kriging metamodel provides real-time deformation feedback for a target and an obstacle to a SPS.},

  abstract  = {This article examines the connecting lines between the Chilean Project Cybersyn’s interface design , the German Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm and its cybernetically inspired approaches towards information design , and later developments in interaction design and the emerging field of Human–Computer Interaction in the USA. In particular, it first examines how early works of designers Tomàs Maldonado and Gui Bonsiepe on operative communication , that is, language-independent (and thus internationalizable) pictogram systems and visual grammars for computational systems, were intertwined with attempts to ground industrial design in a scientific methodology, to address an era of computing machines, and to develop the concept of the interface as a heuristic for a renovated design thinking. It thereby also reconstructs further historical vanishing lines—e.g. the pictorial grammar of Otto Neurath’s ISOTYPE—of the development of the ‘ulm model’ of design. Second , the article explores how an apprehension of first-order cybernetics in West Germany—e.g. represented by hfg ulm staff like Max Bense or Abraham Moles, merged with Cybersyn’s second-order cybernetics ideas, as represented by Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model . And third , it asks about a further conceptual turn regarding an understanding of design which resulted in a focus on communicative interaction, e.g. in the later works of Fernando Flores and Terry Winograd on HCI, or in Beer’s Team Syntegrity approach. As an effect, the text will explore a specific and international network of cybernetic thinking between Latin America, Europe, and North America which emerged around Project Cybersyn, and which was occupied with questions of HCI, a democratization of design, and intelligence amplification.},

Nevertheless, the angle selected when fusing the joint is arbitrarily chosen without any quantified data concerning its mechanical effects, thus preventing the optimal choice for the patient. In the current study, we realized an experiment and developed a numerical model to investigate the effect of fusion angle on the biomechanics of adjacent non-operated joints. Six participants performed a pinch grip task while arthrodesis was simulated with a metal splint. Kinematic and force data were recorded during this task and used in a biomechanical model to estimate contact pressures in adjacent joints. The biomechanical model involved combining a multibody system and a finite element method. Results showed that the angle of any distal interphalangeal joint arthrodesis influences index finger kinematics and maximal grip force in several participants. For one participant, in the arthrodesis simulation, we observed an increase of 1.9 MPa in the proximal interphalangeal joint contact pressure. Our results provide quantified information about the biomechanical consequences of this surgical operation and its potential long-term effects. Graphical abstract },

  abstract  = {Abstract Identifying key factors from observational data is important for understanding complex phenomena in many disciplines, including biomedical sciences and biology. However, there are still some limitations in practical applications, such as severely nonlinear input–output relationships and highly skewed output distributions. To acquire more reliable sensitivity analysis (SA) results in these extreme cases, inspired by the weighted k -nearest neighbors algorithm, we propose a new method called adaptive weighted neighbors (AWN). AWN makes full use of the information contained in all training samples instead of limited samples and automatically gives more weight to nearby samples. Then, the bootstrap technique and Jansen’s method are used to obtain reliable SA results based on AWN. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of AWN by analyzing various biological and biomedical data sets, three simulated examples and two case studies, showing that it can effectively overcome the above limitations. We therefore expect it to be a complementary approach for SA. Graphical Abstract },

Many ET models take satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) as a major input, but how uncertainties of LAI estimations propagate to ET and the partitioning between evaporation and transpiration is poorly understood. Here we assessed six satellite-based LAI estimation approaches using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images against ground measurements from four vineyards in California and evaluated ET sensitivity to LAI in the thermal-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. We found that radiative transfer modeling-based approaches predicted low to medium LAI well, but they significantly underestimated high LAI in highly clumped vine canopies (RMSE   0.97 to 1.27). Cubist regression models trained with ground LAI measurements from all vineyards achieved high accuracy (RMSE   0.3 to 0.48), but these empirical models did not generalize well between sites. Red edge bands and the related vegetation index (VI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite contain complementary information of LAI to VIs based on near-infrared and red bands. TSEB ET was more sensitive to positive LAI biases than negative ones. Positive LAI errors of 50},

  abstract  = {Analytical models of solute transport have been widely used to aid the understanding of the physical and chemical processes undergone by substances introduced in a layered aquifer system. However, in previous studies, the advection component of transport was assumed to be one dimensional, while also ignoring the mixing processes that occur in the inlet and the outlet reservoirs. In this study, new sets of models describing those mixing processes are presented. Beyond that, these models were integrated into already existing models and the result is a novel analytical model of solute transport in aquifer-aquitard systems. The novel analytical solution was derived by the Laplace transform method and the finite-cosine Fourier transform method under the mobile-immobile (MIM) framework. The calculations take into account: the longitudinal and vertical dispersion, the molecular diffusion and the horizonal and vertical advection components of solute transport, as well as first-order chemical reaction, in both the aquifer and the aquitard. A finite-difference solution of the model is tested against experimental data in order to critique its reliability. Results indicate that the numerical and analytical solutions of the new model match well with experimental data. This new model outperforms the previous models in terms of interpreting experimental data. The mixing old and new water in the reservoirs during solute transport in aquifer-aquitard systems is important. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the output concentration of solute in the aquifer-aquitard system is most sensitive to the volume of water in the inlet reservoir. The contribution of the molecular diffusion effect to the total mass flux of the tracer cross the aquifer-aquitard interface is much smaller than the contribution of the dispersive and advective effects.},

  abstract  = {Summary From the perspective of Malaysian health care providers, denosumab was cost-effective in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with an optimal outcome starting at age 60 years. Our results provide important insights into the value for money of anti-osteoporotic agents that can serve as a reference for other countries with comparable epidemiological data. Introduction The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of denosumab with alendronate and no treatment in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis among the Malaysian population. Methods A well-validated Markov model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of denosumab in a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal osteoporotic women between 50 and 80 years old who had no history of fractures. A 10-year time horizon from the perspective of Malaysian health care providers was used in this analysis. The model parameters, including transition probabilities and costs, were based on Malaysian sources. Treatment efficacy data were obtained from a network meta-analysis. The study outcomes were presented as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the robustness of the results. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at MYR 21,438 (USD 5175) per QALY. Results Denosumab was found to be a cost-effective option for postmenopausal osteoporotic women aged 60 and older. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for denosumab versus alendronate ranged from MYR 16,955 (USD 4093) per QALY at age 60 to MYR 4380 (USD 1057) per QALY at age 80. The cost-effectiveness of denosumab improved monotonically with increasing age. Denosumab was 72.8–92.7},

  abstract  = {Workload Control (WLC) is a production planning and control system conceived to reduce queuing times of job-shop systems, and to offer a solution to the lead time syndrome; a critical issue that often bewilders make-to-order manufacturers. Nowadays, advantages of WLC are unanimously acknowledged, but real successful stories are still limited. This paper starts from the lack of a consistent way to assess performance of WLC, an important burden for its acceptance in the industry. As researchers often put more focus on the performance measures that better confirm their hypotheses, many measures, related to different WLC features, have emerged over years. However, this excess of measures may even mislead practitioners, in the evaluation of alternative production planning and control systems. To close this gap, we propose quantifying the main benefit of WLC in economic terms, as this is the easiest, and probably only way, to compare different and even conflicting performance measures. Costs and incomes are identified and used to develop an overall economic measure that can be used to evaluate, or even to fine tune, the operating features of WLC. The quality of our approach is finally demonstrated via simulation, considering the 6-machines job-shop scenario typically adopted as benchmark in technical literature.},

  abstract  = {Context Model driven development envisages the use of model transformations to evolve models. Model transformation languages, developed for this task, are touted with many benefits over general purpose programming languages. However, a large number of these claims have not yet been substantiated. They are also made without the context necessary to be able to critically assess their merit or built meaningful empirical studies around them. Objective The objective of our work is to elicit the reasoning, influences and background knowledge that lead people to assume benefits or drawbacks of model transformation languages. Method We conducted a large-scale interview study involving 56 participants from research and industry. Interviewees were presented with claims about model transformation languages and were asked to provide reasons for their assessment thereof. We qualitatively analysed the responses to find factors that influence the properties of model transformation languages as well as explanations as to how exactly they do so. Results Our interviews show, that general purpose expressiveness of GPLs, domain specific capabilities of MTLs as well as tooling all have strong influences on how people view properties of model transformation languages. Moreover, the Choice of MTL , the Use Case for which a transformation should be developed as well as the Skill s of involved stakeholders have a moderating effect on the influences, by changing the context to consider. Conclusion There is a broad body of experience, that suggests positive and negative influences for properties of MTLs. Our data suggests, that much needs to be done in order to convey the viability of model transformation languages. Efforts to provide more empirical substance need to be undergone and lacklustre language capabilities and tooling need to be improved upon. We suggest several approaches for this that can be based on the results of the presented study.},

  abstract  = {Combination therapies simultaneously inhibiting different therapeutic targets in cancer is challenged by individual pharmacokinetic profiles. Here, the authors generate an orally provided multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that is lymphatic absorbed and increases survival in a murine model of myelofibrosis. Activation of compensatory signaling nodes in cancer often requires combination therapies that are frequently plagued by dose-limiting toxicities. Intestinal lymphatic drug absorption is seldom explored, although reduced toxicity and sustained drug levels would be anticipated to improve systemic bioavailability. A potent orally bioavailable multi-functional kinase inhibitor (LP-182) is described with intrinsic lymphatic partitioning for the combined targeting of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways without observable toxicity. We demonstrate selectivity and therapeutic efficacy through reduction of downstream kinase activation, amelioration of disease phenotypes, and improved survival in animal models of myelofibrosis. Our further characterization of synthetic and physiochemical properties for small molecule lymphatic uptake will support continued advancements in lymphatropic therapy for altering disease trajectories of a myriad of human disease indications.},

  abstract  = {Ground subsidence and uplift caused by the annual thawing and freezing of the active layer are important variables in permafrost studies. Global positioning system interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR) has been successfully applied to retrieve the continuous ground surface movements in permafrost areas. However, only GPS signals were used in previous studies. In this study, using multiple global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations recorded by a GNSS station SG27 in Utqiaġvik, Alaska during the period from 2018 to 2021, we applied multiple GNSS-IR (multi-GNSS-IR) technique to the SNR data and obtained the complete and continuous ground surface elevation changes over the permafrost area at a daily interval in snow-free seasons in 2018 and 2019. The GLONASS-IR and Galileo-IR measurements agreed with the GPS-IR measurements at L1 frequency, which are the most consistent measurements among all multi-GNSS measurements, in terms of the overall subsidence trend but clearly showed periodic noises. We proposed a method to reconstruct the GLONASS- and Galileo-IR elevation changes by specifically grouping and fitting them with a composite model. Compared with GPS L1 results, the unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) of the reconstructed Galileo measurements reduced by 50.0},

  abstract  = {The variety feature of Big Data, represented by multi-model data , has brought a new dimension of complexity to all aspects of data management. The need to process a set of distinct but interlinked data models is a challenging task. In this paper, we focus on the problem of inference of a schema, i.e., the description of the structure of data. While several verified approaches exist in the single-model world, their application for multi-model data is not straightforward. We introduce an approach that ensures inference of a common schema of multi-model data capturing their specifics. It can infer local integrity constraints as well as intra- and inter-model references. Following the standard features of Big Data, it can cope with overlapping models, i.e., data redundancy, and it is designed to process efficiently significant amounts of data.To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach addressing schema inference in the world of multi-model databases.},

  abstract  = {Most of Kriging-based adaptive sampling approaches were focused only on the sequence architectures for producing limited (i.e., one or two) updating points, but few attention was given to the parallel sampling strategy to obtain multiple updating points in one iteration. In this study, a novel Kriging-based adaptive parallel sampling approach (KAPS-MEIGF) is proposed. This parallel sampling approach selects the first most informative update point by maximizing the expected improvement of global fit (EIGF) criterion that considers both the bias and variance information. Then the parallel sampling criterion with a threshold value is used to generate multiple potential sample points. Particularly, the cross-validation strategy is used to dynamically balance the global exploitation and local exploitation. The results of 18 test cases show that the proposed KAPS-MEIGF outperforms the EIGF sampling approach but it is worse than the maximum mean square error (MMSE) sampling approach and the combined expectation (CE) sampling approach for most of the 2-dimension test cases. However, for high-dimensional complex problems, KAPS-MEIGF exhibits significantly competing performance compared with the MMSE sampling approach and the CE sampling approach, which indicates the robustness of stability of KAPS-MEIGF. In addition, the running speed of KAPS-MEIGF is 2.8–30.9 times that of the MMSE sampling approach. Therefore, it is a very promising sampling approach to build Kriging models for the problems with diverse characteristics, especially for simulation-based high-dimensional problems. Finally, a multi-objective optimization of rotating impeller module with static cascade (RIM-SC) for rotary separated range hood illustrates the engineering application value of KAPS-MEIGF method. The result shows that the searching efficiency of KAPS-MEIGF method is about 4.4 times higher when compared to other sequence sampling strategy. For the optimized RIM-SC, both separation efficiency and exhaust airflow rate at design condition are improved by 20.3},

  abstract  = {Handling constraints imposed on physical dimensions of microwave circuits has become an important design consideration over the recent years. It is primarily fostered by the needs of emerging application areas such as 5G mobile communications, internet of things, or wearable/implantable devices. The size of conventional passive components is determined by the guided wavelength, and its reduction requires topological modifications, e.g., transmission line folding, or utilization of compact cells capitalizing on the slow-wave phenomenon. The resulting miniaturized structures are geometrically complex and typically exhibit strong cross coupling effects, which cannot be adequately accounted for by analytical or equivalent network models. Consequently, electromagnetic (EM)-driven parameter tuning is necessary, which is computationally expensive. When the primary objective is size reduction, the optimization task becomes far more challenging due to the presence of constraints related to electrical performance figures (bandwidth, power split ratio, etc.), which are all costly to evaluate. A popular solution approach is to utilize penalty functions. Therein, possible violations of constraints degrade the primary objective, thereby enforcing their satisfaction. Yet, the appropriate setup of penalty coefficients is a non-trivial problem by itself, and is often associated to extra computational expenses. In this work, we propose an explicit approach to constraint handling, which is combined with the trust-region gradient-search procedure. In our technique, the decision about the adjustment of the search radius is determined based on the reliability of rendering the feasible region boundary by linear approximation models of the constraints. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted using three miniaturized coupler structures demonstrate superiority of the presented method over the penalty function paradigm. Apart from the efficacy, its appealing features include algorithmic simplicity, and no need for tailoring the procedure for a particular circuit to be optimized.},

Isotopic niche space revealed distinctly higher δ^15N area in black turtles and significant overlap between yellow and hawksbill turtles, and a recent shift in diet in yellow turtles from omnivory to herbivory. In black turtles, isotopic niche suggests individual specialization during the non-upwelling season and generalization in diet during the upwelling season. Mixing model results suggest that black turtles forage at multiple trophic levels (fish: 34.8 ± 10.1},

  abstract  = {The engineering of mechatronic production systems is complex and requires various disciplines (e.g., systems, mechanical, electrical and software engineers). Model-driven engineering (MDE) supports systems development and the exchange of information based on models and transformations. However, the integration and adoption of different modeling approaches are becoming challenges when it comes to cross-disciplinary work. VIATRA is a long-living enduring and mature modeling framework that offers rich model transformation features to develop MDE applications. This study investigates the extent to which VIATRA can be applied in the engineering of mechatronic production systems. For this purpose, two model transformation case studies are presented: “SysML – AutomationML” and “SysML4 Mechatronics  – AutomationML.” Both case studies are representative of structural modeling and interdisciplinary data exchange during the development of mechatronic production systems. These case studies are derived from other researchers in the community. A VIATRA software prototype implements these case studies as a batch-oriented transformation and serves as one basis for evaluating VIATRA. To report on our observations and findings, we built on an evaluation framework from the MDE community. This framework considers 14 different characteristics (e.g., maturity, size, execution time, modularity, learnability), according to the Goal-Question-Metric paradigm. To be able to evaluate our findings, we compared VIATRA to ATL. We applied all cases to a lab-size mechatronic production system. We found that, with VIATRA, the same functions for model transformation applications can be achieved as with ATL, which is popular for model transformations in both the MDE and the mechatronic production systems community. VIATRA combines the relational, imperative, and graph-based paradigms and enables the development and execution of model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. Furthermore, the VIATRA internal DSL is based on Xtend and Java, making VIATRA attractive and intuitive for users with less experience in modeling than in object-oriented programming. Thus, VIATRA leads to an interesting alternative for the model-driven engineering of mechatronic production systems. It has the potential to reduce the complexity during the development of model transformations. To conclude, this paper evaluates the applicability of VIATRA, its strengths and limitations. It provides lessons learned and insights that can stimulate further research in the MDE for mechatronic production systems.},

  abstract  = {Enterprise modeling deals with the increasing complexity of processes and systems by operationalizing model content and by linking complementary models and languages, thus amplifying the model value beyond mere comprehensible pictures. To enable this amplification and turn models into computer-processable structures, a comprehensive formalization is needed. This paper presents the formalism MetaMorph based on typed first-order logic and provides a perspective on the potential and benefits of formalization that arise for a variety of research issues in conceptual modeling. MetaMorph defines modeling languages as formal languages with a signature 
$$\varSigma $$
 Σ —comprising object types, relation types, and attributes through types and function symbols—and a set of constraints. Four case studies are included to show the effectiveness of this approach. Applying the MetaMorph formalism to the next level in the hierarchy of models, we create M2FOL , a formal modeling language for metamodels. We show that M2FOL is self-describing and therefore complete the formalization of the full four-layer metamodeling stack. On the basis of our generic formalism applicable to arbitrary modeling languages, we examine four current research topics—modeling with power types, language interleaving     consistency, operations on models, and automatic translation of formalizations to platform-specific code—and how to approach them with the MetaMorph formalism. This shows that the rich knowledge stack on formal languages in logic offers new tools for old problems.},

  abstract  = {In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) vision, everyday objects evolve into cyber-physical systems. The massive use and deployment of these systems has given place to the Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT (IIoT). Due to its scalability requirements, IIoT architectures are typically distributed and asynchronous. In this scenario, one of the most widely used paradigms is publish/subscribe , where messages are sent and received based on a set of categories or topics . However, these architectures face interoperability challenges. Consistency in message categories and structure is the key to avoid potential losses of information. Ensuring this consistency requires complex data processing logic both on the publisher and the subscriber sides. In this paper, we present our proposal relying on AsyncAPI to automate the design and implementation of these asynchronous architectures using model-driven techniques for the generation of (part of) message-driven infrastructures. Our proposal offers two different ways of designing the architectures: either graphically, by modeling and annotating the messages that are sent among the different IoT devices, or textually, by implementing an editor compliant with the AsyncAPI specification. We have evaluated our proposal by conducting a set of experiments with 25 subjects with different expertise and background. The experiments show that one-third of the subjects were able to design and implement a working architecture in less than an hour without previous knowledge of our proposal, and an additional one-third estimated that they would only need less than two hours in total.},

In this sense, we aim at providing a novel approach based on a modeling language that can be used even by care-givers or non-experts to model human emotion w.r.t. context for human support services. The proposed modeling approach is based on Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) which helps to integrate different IoT data sources in AAL environment. Consequently, it provides a conceptual support level related to the current emotional states of the observed subject. For the evaluation, we show the evaluation of the well-validated System Usability Score (SUS) to prove that the proposed modeling language achieves high performance in terms of usability and learn-ability metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance at runtime of the model instantiation by measuring the execution time using well-known IoT services.},

It enables the creation of so-called essential models of enterprises. Such models are enterprise models that aim to focus on the organisational essence of an enterprise by leaving out (as much as possible) details of the socio-technical implementation. The organisational essence is then expressed primarily in terms of the actor roles involved, and the business transactions between these roles. The DEMO method has a firm theoretical foundation. At the same time, there is an increasing uptake of DEMO in practice. This also results in a need for enterprise-grade tool support for the use of the method. In this paper, we report on a study concerning the selection, configuration, and extension, of an enterprise-grade tool platform to support the use of DEMO in practice. The configuration of the selected tool framework to support DEMO modelling, provided general insights regarding the development of enterprise-grade tool support for (model-driven) methods such as DEMO, while also providing feedback on the consistency and completeness of the DEMO specification language; the specification language that accompanies the DEMO method.},

One way to fulfill this goal is to prepare preservice science teachers to integrate computer science skills, such as coding, into science education learning contexts that can benefit from it. This study implemented Coding in Scientific Modeling Lessons (CS-ModeL) in a science teacher education course. CS-ModeL is the name of an instructional module and of an online tool, and they aim to support preservice science teachers’ use of coding in scientific modeling and lesson design. Preservice teachers used block-based coding to create science simulations, performed analogous physical experiments, and designed lessons in which they support scientific modeling with coding. This mixed methods study investigated if and how participation in CS-ModeL affected preservice teachers’ epistemological understanding of scientific models and modeling along with their understanding of computer science concepts. This study also examined coding-enhanced scientific modeling activities in their designed lessons. Results showed an overall improvement in participants’ epistemological understanding of models and modeling, and in their understanding of computer science concepts. Participants’ lessons featured activities in which block-based coding simulations are used either as a research tool or as an exploration tool. Additionally, most lessons targeted computer science practices, but not concepts. It was also found that participants’ lessons were not aligned with their epistemological understanding of models and modeling.

  abstract  = {Natural ventilation (NV) is a key passive strategy to design energy-efficient buildings and improve indoor air quality. Therefore, accurate modeling of the NV effects is a basic requirement to include this technique during the building design process. However, there is an important lack of wind pressure coefficients ( C _ p ) data, essential input parameters for NV models. Besides this, there are no simple but still reliable tools to predict C _ p data on buildings with arbitrary shapes and surrounding conditions, which means a significant limitation to NV modeling in real applications. For this reason, the present contribution proposes a novel cloud-based platform to predict wind pressure coefficients on buildings. The platform comprises a set of tools for performing fully unattended computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer and getting reliable C _ p data for actual scenarios. CFD-expert decisions throughout the entire workflow are implemented to automatize the generation of the computational domain, the meshing procedure, the solution stage, and the post-processing of the results. To evaluate the performance of the platform, an exhaustive validation against wind tunnel experimental data is carried out for a wide range of case studies. These include buildings with openings, balconies, irregular floor-plans, and surrounding urban environments. The C _ p results are in close agreement with experimental data, reducing 60},

  abstract  = {During the development of a software project, developers often need to upgrade third-party libraries (TPLs), aiming to keep their code up-to-date with the newest functionalities offered by the used libraries. In most cases, upgrading used TPLs is a complex and error-prone activity that must be carefully carried out to limit the ripple effects on the software project that depends on the libraries being upgraded. In this paper, we propose EvoPlan as a novel approach to the recommendation of different upgrade plans given a pair of library-version as input. In particular, among the different paths that can be possibly followed to upgrade the current library version to the desired updated one, EvoPlan is able to suggest the plan that can potentially minimize the efforts being needed to migrate the code of the clients from the library’s current release to the target one. The approach has been evaluated on a curated dataset using conventional metrics used in Information Retrieval, i.e., precision, recall, and F-measure. The experimental results show that EvoPlan obtains an encouraging prediction performance considering two different criteria in the plan specification, i.e., the popularity of migration paths and the number of open and closed issues in GitHub for those projects that have already followed the recommended migration paths.},

  abstract  = {Text messaging while driving has been considered a dangerous activity that may lead to serious injuries and traffic fatalities. Several assistive technologies and solutions have been developed to simplify texting activity. However, due to inconsistent and complex interface design, lack of logical navigational order, lack of context, complicated text-entry layouts, and laborious activities, the existing texting-related activities can lead to accidents. This paper recognized the risky driving patterns using the real-time AutoLog application. Based on this risky driving behavior, we have proposed ConTEXT, a usable SMS client, to overcome the issues pertaining to the usability of textual activities on smartphones while driving. ConTEXT application is evaluated both empirically as well as through real-time AutoLog application. We have collected data from 117 drivers through a questionnaire. The results show that the data are found reliable also alpha scores for all factors seem internally consistent as it ranges from 0.70 to 0.79 which is good. Similarly, we have reported Principal Component Factor Analysis and found satisfied and appropriate as the Eigenvalue for all the factors is greater than zero. Furthermore, results obtained from the AutoLog dataset show an improved user experience, better control over the touch screen with minimum visual, physical, and mental load.},

The effects of LVG pairs in transverse microchambers on thermal–hydraulic performances due to the Nusselt number and flow friction, as well as the entropy generation due to the heat transfer and flow irreversibility in microchannel are analyzed for Reynolds number of 133–596. The studied parameters of LVG pairs include height ( H  = 0.025–0.175 mm), transverse spacing ( S  = 0.01–0.07 mm) and setting angle ( A  = 30–75º). The results indicate that LVG pairs plays a significant effect on the thermal–hydraulic performance and entropy generation in microchannel as consequence of the perturbation generated by longitudinal vortexes in transverse microchambers. The greatest overall thermal performance factor of 1.45 and the lowest augmentation entropy generation number of 0.764 are both obtained by LVG pairs with H  = 0.075 mm, S  = 0.01 mm and A  = 75º at Reynolds number of 596.},

  abstract  = {The lunar volcanic glasses and Mg-suite rocks represent the early enigmatic episodes of lunar magmatism. Due to the gravitational instability of the Fe–Ti enriched (± KREEP) layer, which is formed at the later stage of fractional crystallization, a post-magma-ocean cumulate overturn occurred contemporaneously or near-contemporaneously with the lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification. The radioactive elements within the KREEP layer were transferred downward and provided continuous energy for the partial melting of the Moon’s interior. The melt from the Moon’s interior and those from decompression melting, in turn, provide source magma for the origin of lunar volcanic glasses and Mg-suite. However, experimental and theoretical studies on the formation process of lunar volcanic glasses and Mg-suite show that the origin of their parental magma is poorly constrained, which largely depends on the initial depth and composition of the LMO. This review examines the mineralogy, petrogenesis, and distribution of lunar volcanic glasses and Mg-suite. Combining with existing models, we constrain the degree, distribution, and timescale of lunar mantle overturn and explore their relationship with later stages of LMO differentiation. We propose an updated chemical composition of the lunar interior, which provides a useful reference for estimating the bulk composition and early differentiation of the Moon and the early Earth.},

  abstract  = {Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is a fundamental task in mineral exploration. The logistic regression (LR) method has been widely used as a data-driven tool for MPM because it is compact and straightforward, and it presents explicit explanations. However, there exists the inherent deficiency of linear assumption in the ordinary LR method. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a hybrid model (i.e., hybrid GEP–LR) that combines LR with gene expression programming (GEP) has been developed. It uses the evolutionary algorithm of GEP to discover automatically the symbolic function defined in the logit transformation of the ordinary LR method without any assumption. To investigate the performance of the hybrid GEP–LR hybrid method, a synthetic data modeling and a case study of prospectivity mapping for porphyry Cu–Mo polymetallic deposits (PCMPDs) in the Eastern Tianshan region, northwestern China are presented here. In the synthetic data modeling, two different datasets, namely linearly separable dataset and nonlinearly separable dataset, were generated by Monte Carlo simulation. By defining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a fitness function, these two datasets were used to validate the efficiency of the hybrid GEP–LR method in classification of both linearly and nonlinearly separable datasets. In the case study, 15 hybrid GEP–LR models were designed using 15 different evolutionary strategies of the GEP algorithm including the number of genes, the head length of every gene, and the set of functions. Binary maps of prospectivity for PCMPDs derived using these 15 hybrid GEP–LR models with the fitness function of AUC were compared and contrasted with the one derived using the ordinary LR method. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid GEP–LR method is a robust data-driven tool that can deal with both linear and nonlinear problems in data mining. It outperforms the ordinary LR method in predicting target areas for mineral prospecting. GEP provides an inspiring way to combine other machine learning methods in addressing challenges associated with supervised or unsupervised classification issues with respect to complex nonlinearly distributed geodata.},

  abstract  = {SkePU is a pattern-based high-level programming model for transparent program execution on heterogeneous parallel computing systems. A key feature of SkePU is that, in general, the selection of the execution platform for a skeleton-based function call need not be determined statically. On single-node systems, SkePU can select among CPU, multithreaded CPU, single or multi-GPU execution. Many scientific applications use pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) as part of the computation. In the interest of correctness and debugging, deterministic parallel execution is a desirable property, which however requires a deterministically parallelized pseudo-random number generator. We present the API and implementation of a deterministic, portable parallel PRNG extension to SkePU that is scalable by design and exhibits the same behavior regardless where and with how many resources it is executed. We evaluate it with four probabilistic applications and show that the PRNG enables scalability on both multi-core CPU and GPU resources, and hence supports the universal portability of SkePU code even in the presence of PRNG calls, while source code complexity is reduced.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of reference conceptual models to capture information about complex and sensitive business domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, space). These models play a fundamental role in different types of critical semantic interoperability tasks. Therefore, domain experts must be able to understand and reason with their content. In other words, these models need to be cognitively tractable . This paper contributes to this goal by proposing a model clustering technique that leverages on the rich semantics of ontology-driven conceptual models (ODCM). In particular, we propose a formal notion of Relational Context to guide the automated clusterization (or modular breakdown) of conceptual models. Such Relational Contexts capture all the information needed for understanding entities “qua players of roles” in the scope of an objectified (reified) relationship (relator). The paper also presents computational support for automating the identification of Relational Contexts and this modular breakdown procedure. Finally, we report the results of an empirical study assessing the cognitive effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract  = {Generalization of conditioned fear is adaptive in some situations but maladaptive when fear excessively generalizes to innocuous stimuli with incidental resemblance to a genuine threat cue. Recently, empirical interest in fear generalization as a transdiagnostic explanatory mechanism underlying anxiety-related disorders has accelerated. As there are now several studies of fear generalization across multiple types of anxiety-related disorders, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting behavioral measures (subjective ratings and psychophysiological indices) of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorder vs. comparison groups. We conducted systematic searches of electronic databases (conducted from January–October 2020) for fear generalization studies involving anxiety-related disorder groups or subclinical analog groups. A total of 300 records were full-text screened and two unpublished datasets were obtained, yielding 16 studies reporting behavioral fear generalization measures. Random-effects meta-analytic models and meta-regressions were applied to the identified data. Fear generalization was significantly heightened in anxiety-related disorder participants ( N  = 439) relative to comparison participants ( N  = 428). We did not identify any significant clinical, sample, or methodological moderators. Heightened fear generalization is quantitatively supported as distinguishing anxiety-related disorder groups from comparison groups. Evidence suggests this effect is transdiagnostic, relatively robust to experimental or sample parameters, and that generalization paradigms are a well-supported framework for neurobehavioral investigations of learning and emotion in anxiety-related disorders. We discuss these findings in the context of prior fear conditioning meta-analyses, past neuroimaging investigations of fear generalization in anxiety-related disorders, and future directions and challenges for the field.},

Concomitant analytic advances enable rigorous identification and quantification of functionally important features of brain network architecture. Null models are a flexible tool to statistically benchmark the presence or magnitude of features of interest, by selectively preserving specific architectural properties of brain networks while systematically randomizing others. Here we describe the logic, implementation and interpretation of null models of connectomes. We introduce randomization and generative approaches to constructing null networks, and outline a taxonomy of network methods for statistical inference. We highlight the spectrum of null models — from liberal models that control few network properties, to conservative models that recapitulate multiple properties of empirical networks — that allow us to operationalize and test detailed hypotheses about the structure and function of brain networks. We review emerging scenarios for the application of null models in network neuroscience, including for spatially embedded networks, annotated networks and correlation-derived networks. Finally, we consider the limits of null models, as well as outstanding questions for the field. Comparisons of real networks with null models enable researchers to test how statistically unexpected a particular network feature is. In this Review, Váša and Mišić describe different null-model approaches and instantiations, as well as their emerging uses and limitations.},

  abstract  = {After the occurrence of a natural disaster, it is of paramount importance to take efficient measures to reduce the casualties and damage to infrastructure. Resource allocation is a generic problem of assigning available resources to the affected areas to cope with the devastation caused by the disaster. To mitigate the deadly effect of a natural disaster, different resources are essential at the emergency sites. Disaster response activities also need the assignment of various critical tasks to be carried out by different emergency workers at the local level. The individual emergency locations convey their demands for resources and required services to the higher-level authorities. Depending on availability, the higher-level authority allocates resources through successive lower levels to the emergency sites. This paper proposes a model for the hierarchical flow of different resources during disaster management in the Indian context, from the top-level authority to the lower levels. This hierarchical architecture also incorporates the allocation of different essential tasks at the ground level to reduce the effect of a natural disaster locally.},

The importance of an open, standardized and adaptable approach to clinical data lies in extracting value to generate useful knowledge that really can help healthcare professionals make an assertive decision. This importance is even more accentuated when facing a pandemic context. Thus, in this study, a system for tracking symptoms and health conditions of suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a Portuguese hospital was developed using openEHR. All data on the evolutionary status of patients in home care as well as the results of their COVID-19 test were used to train different ML algorithms, with the aim of developing a predictive model capable of identifying COVID-19 infections according to the severity of symptoms identified by patients.

Wave-induced downward propagating positive stratosphere/troposphere-coupled Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and associated stratospheric cooling initiate delayed thermohaline strengthening of Atlantic overturning circulation and extratropical Atlantic-gyres. These increase the poleward oceanic heat transport leading to Arctic sea-ice melting, Arctic warming amplification, and large-scale Atlantic warming, which in turn initiates wave-induced downward propagating negative NAM and stratospheric warming and therefore reverse the oscillation phase. This coupled variability improves the performance of statistical models, which project further weakening of North Atlantic Oscillation, North Atlantic cooling and hiatus in wintertime North Atlantic-Arctic sea-ice and global surface temperature just like the 1950s–1970s.},

  abstract  = {Atmospheric concentrations of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, have strongly increased since 2007. Measurements of stable carbon isotopes of methane can constrain emissions if the isotopic compositions are known; however, isotopic compositions of methane emissions from wetlands are poorly constrained despite their importance. Here, we use a process-based biogeochemistry model to calculate the stable carbon isotopic composition of global wetland methane emissions. We estimate a mean global signature of −61.3 ± 0.7‰ and find that tropical wetland emissions are enriched by  11‰ relative to boreal wetlands. Our model shows improved resolution of regional, latitudinal and global variations in isotopic composition of wetland emissions. Atmospheric simulation scenarios with the improved wetland isotopic composition suggest that increases in atmospheric methane since 2007 are attributable to rising microbial emissions. Our findings substantially reduce uncertainty in the stable carbon isotopic composition of methane emissions from wetlands and improve understanding of the global methane budget. A process-based carbon isotope biogeochemistry model substantially reduces uncertainty in regional and global estimates of the stable carbon isotopic composition of methane emissions from wetlands and suggests rising atmospheric concentrations are due to increased microbial emissions.},

  abstract  = {COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is the most consequential pandemic of this century. Since the outbreak in late 2019, animal models have been playing crucial roles in aiding the rapid development of vaccines/drugs for prevention and therapy, as well as understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses of hosts. However, the current animal models have some deficits and there is an urgent need for novel models to evaluate the virulence of variants of concerns (VOC), antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and various comorbidities of COVID-19. This review summarizes the clinical features of COVID-19 in different populations, and the characteristics of the major animal models of SARS-CoV-2, including those naturally susceptible animals, such as non-human primates, Syrian hamster, ferret, minks, poultry, livestock, and mouse models sensitized by genetically modified, AAV/adenoviral transduced, mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2, and by engraftment of human tissues or cells. Since understanding the host receptors and proteases is essential for designing advanced genetically modified animal models, successful studies on receptors and proteases are also reviewed. Several improved alternatives for future mouse models are proposed, including the reselection of alternative receptor genes or multiple gene combinations, the use of transgenic or knock-in method, and different strains for establishing the next generation of genetically modified mice.},

  abstract  = {Mutations in CHCHD10 , a gene coding for a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, are associated with Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) spectrum disorders, which are pathologically characterized by cytoplasmic inclusions containing TDP-43. FTD/ALS-linked CHCHD10 mutations and TDP-43 inclusions similarly induce mitochondrial defects in respiration, fusion/fission, mtDNA stability, and cristae structure, while sizeable amounts of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates are found in mitochondria. However, the mechanistic link between CHCHD10 and TDP-43 pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we present immunohistochemical and biochemical evidence demonstrating that insoluble CHCHD10 aggregates accumulate and colocalize with phospho-TDP-43 inclusions in brains of FTLD-TDP and AD patients, and that insoluble CHCHD10 levels tightly correlate with insoluble TDP-43 levels in control and FTLD-TDP brains. In an experimental exploration of this pathological phenotype, transgenic mice neuronally expressing FTD/ALS-linked CHCHD10^R15L or CHCHD^S59L mutations but not CHCHD10^WT transgenic mice exhibit significantly increased CHCHD10 aggregation and phospho-TDP-43 pathology, which often colocalize within the same inclusions. Such pathologies are reflected in poor functional outcomes in long-term synaptic plasticity, motor unit physiology, and behavior in CHCHD10^R15L and CHCHD^S59L transgenic mice. In contrast, expression of CHCHD10^WT in hTDP-43 transgenic mice (TAR4;CHCHD10^WT) significantly mitigates phospho-TDP-43 pathology and rescues TDP-43-induced impairments in synaptic integrity and long-term synaptic plasticity. In isolated mitochondria, the S59L mutation induces the aggregation of resident CHCHD10^S59L protein as well as the aggregation and slower turnover of recombinant TDP-43 imported into mitochondria. Likewise, in an in vitro cell-free system, the S59L mutation induces the aggregation of CHCHD10^S59L protein while simultaneously enhancing the aggregation of recombinant TDP-43, as evidenced by filter trap assays and atomic force microscopy. In contrast, recombinant CHCHD10^WT inhibits the growth of TDP-43 aggregates. These results in human brains, transgenic mice, and in vitro systems substantiate the role of wild type and mutant CHCHD10 in modulating mitochondrial CHCHD10 and TDP-43 pathogenesis together with associated phenotypes in long-term synaptic plasticity and motor unit physiology in mice and humans.},

  abstract  = {The diffusion of seismic structural health monitoring systems, evaluating the dynamic response of engineering structures to earthquakes, is growing significantly among strategic buildings. The increasing availability of valuable vibration data is being backed by continuously evolving techniques for analysing and assessing structural health and damage. Within this framework, the paper proposes a novel model-driven vibration-based methodology to support the assessment of the damage level in masonry buildings hit by earthquakes. The leading idea is to exploit, in the pre-event phase, synthetic equivalent-frame modelling and nonlinear dynamic analyses to systematically relate the gradual reduction of natural frequencies to increasing levels of structural damage. The resulting behavioural chart ( seismic chart ) of the building, constructed by employing computational tools and robustly defined on a statistical base, may provide the theoretical expectation to ascertain a certain level of seismic damage, based on the decrease in vibration frequency experimentally identified in the post-event phase. The methodology is firstly formalized, integrating common identification techniques with a novel damage grade estimation procedure, and finally exemplified for a monitored strategic masonry building damaged by the 2016–2017 Central Italy earthquake sequence. The outcomes of this application confirm the operational validity of the methodology, which can be intended as effective support for the decision-making process regarding structural usability and safety in the post-earthquake scenario.},

  abstract  = {Although computer technologies have greatly advanced in recent years and help engineers improve work efficiency, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) design process is still very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for automating the entire design process to replace current human-based HVAC design procedures. This framework includes the following automated processes: building information modeling (BIM) simplification, building energy modeling (BEM) generation     load calculation, HVAC system topology generation     equipment sizing, and system diagram generation. In this study, we analyze the importance of each process and possible ways to implement them using software. Then, we use a case study to test the automated design procedure and illustrate the feasibility of the new automated design approach. The purpose of this study is to simplify the steps in the traditional rule-based HVAC system design process by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on the traditional computer-aided design (CAD) process. Experimental results show that the automatic processes are feasible, compared with the traditional design process can effectively shorten the design time from 23.37 working hours to nearly 1 hour, and improve the efficiency.},

Thermal comfort (heating, ventilation, air cooling, airtightness, fabric performance) in buildings keeps the occupants energetic and positive. The study’s objective is to maintain residents’ comfort levels in their homes in the elimination of heat and humidity. Therefore, findings indicate that it is necessary to design a structure according to thermal comfort, decrease in carbon emission, air flows, electricity control, fuel, etc. This article provides detailed information about civil engineering structures’ excellent and bad thermal performance, including buildings like residential, commercial, and educational institutions. This article provides an incisive assessment of the thermal performance, thermal comfort, thermal resistance, and thermal sensation of residential, commercial, and educational structures. The article contains in-depth information as well as case studies on how to improve indoor air quality and energy efficiency. Additionally, the topic of building energy consumption is discussed. The use of thermal performance of various building in various climatic circumstances has been discussed extensively in the works provided. A building’s thermal performance determines how quickly heat enters the building and how quickly it is warmed. Heat travels faster through a poorly performing building, and the interior temperature is ultimately dependent on external temperature and climate changes. The thermal performance of different types of buildings such as residential, commercial, and educational buildings was analyzed in this study.},

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things (IoT) concept is expected to be a crucial component of human life in the near future. In IoT, devices provide functionalities as services. By integrating primitive services of interconnected IoT devices, complex IoT applications are composed. In a large-scale IoT environment, the selection of IoT services is essential. The services must be selected considering Quality-of-Service (QoS), energy consumption, and fairness among IoT services. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization-based IoT service composition framework for fog-based IoT networks. The proposed solution takes advantage of the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II). The cloud controller distributes application requests to fog servers as application requests arrive. Fog servers decompose application requests into IoT service requests and then slice IoT service requests into time windows. Each time window is optimized individually using the proposed model considering QoS, energy consumption, and fairness. Experimental evaluation results show that the proposed approach can optimize energy consumption and fairness without causing any QoS degradation.},

  abstract  = {Fluvial and surge-tide extremes can occur synchronously resulting in compound flooding in estuaries, greatly intensifying the hazard. This flood risk has the potential to increase in the future as the frequency, phasing and/or intensity of these drivers change. Improved understanding of how extreme fluvial discharge and surge-tides interact will help inform future flood mitigation methodology. In this paper, therefore, we resolve for the first time intra-estuary sensitivities to fluvial and surge-tide extremes, for two contrasting UK estuaries (Humber and Dyfi). Model simulations at hyper-spatial resolution (< 50 m) using a 2D hydrodynamic model predicted compound flooding hazards based on: (1) present-day extreme events (worst on record); (2) present-day extreme events with shifted timings of the drivers to maximise flooding; and (3) modified drivers representing projected climate change. We found that in a small estuary with short-duration, high-intensity fluvial inputs (Dyfi), flood extent is sensitive to the relative timing of the fluvial and surge-tide drivers. In contrast, the relative timing of these drivers did not affect flooding in a larger estuary with a slower fluvial response to rainfall (Humber). In the Humber, extreme fluvial inputs during a compound hazard actually reduced maximum water depths in the outer estuary, compared with a surge-tide-only event. Projected future changes in these drivers by 2100 will increase compound flooding hazards: simulated sea-level rise scenarios predicted substantial and widespread flooding in both estuaries. However, projected increases in surge-tide behaved differently to sea-level rise of the same magnitude, resulting in a greater seawater influx and more flooding. Increased fluvial volumes were the weakest driver of estuarine flooding. In this paper we show how these interactions are complex and how the hydrodynamics vary considerably between different estuaries and sites within estuaries, making it difficult to generalise, use probabilistic or use 1D approaches for assessing compound flooding hazards. Hence, we contribute new knowledge and methods for catchment-to-coast impact modelling used for flood mitigation strategies.},

  abstract  = {Parametric variability is inevitable in actual energy harvesters. It can significantly affect crucial aspects of the system performance, especially in harvesting systems that present geometric parameters, material properties, or excitation conditions that are susceptible to small perturbations. This work aims to develop an investigation to identify the most critical parameters in the dynamic behavior of asymmetric bistable energy harvesters with nonlinear piezoelectric coupling, considering the variability of their physical and excitation properties. For this purpose, a global sensitivity analysis based on orthogonal variance decomposition, employing Sobol indices, is performed to quantify the effect of the harvester parameters on the variance of the recovered power. This technique quantifies the variance concerning each parameter individually and collectively regarding the total variation of the model. The results indicate that the frequency and amplitude of excitation, asymmetric terms and electrical proprieties of the piezoelectric coupling are the most critical parameters that affect the mean power harvested. It is also shown that the order of importance of the parameters can change according to the stability of the harvester’s dynamic response. In this way, a better understanding of the system under analysis is obtained since the study allows the identification of vital parameters that rule the change of dynamic behavior and therefore constitutes a powerful tool in the robust design, optimization, and response prediction of nonlinear harvesters.},

  abstract  = {As novel coastal structures, pile row structures, such as breakwaters, have received increasing attention owing to their advantages in coastal protection and coastal landscape improvement. In this study, a nonlinear sediment model is developed based on OpenFOAM® to explore the effect of the pile row structure on the evolution of sandy beaches by waves. Its robustness was proved by published data related to two typical cases, that is, a pure sandy beach and a single pile on a sandy beach. Subsequently, the beach evolution and pile row with varied pile spaces S/D (the D is the pile diameter and S indicates the space between adjacent piles) on the beach were modeled. In addition, a long-term simulation was performed. The results revealed that the backrush-induced beach scour was larger than that induced by the uprush during wave propagation along sandy beaches. Sandy beach morphology changes because of the construction of the pile row structure by adjusting the wave motion, and local vortices and their evolution did not exhibit a simple linear relation following the variation in S/D . The local scour decreased with the increase in S/D when the S/D was less than 1.6, but it increased on the seaside of the piles and both side faces, except the leeside for S/D increased from 1.6 to 1.8. Meanwhile, in the nearshore zone, the pile row structure was effective in trapping beach sand, and its effectiveness was more remarkable as the S/D decreased. The findings would be useful in assessing the influence of pile row structures on beach evolution by waves and provide a basis for coastal protection engineering.},

  abstract  = {Arctic shrubs cool permafrost in winter by acting as a thermal bridge through the snowpack, according to ground temperature observations and heat transfer simulations. Considerable expansion of shrubs across the Arctic tundra has been observed in recent decades. These shrubs are thought to have a warming effect on permafrost by increasing snowpack thermal insulation, thereby limiting winter cooling and accelerating thaw. Here, we use ground temperature observations and heat transfer simulations to show that low shrubs can actually cool the ground in winter by providing a thermal bridge through the snowpack. Observations from unmanipulated herb tundra and shrub tundra sites on Bylot Island in the Canadian high Arctic reveal a 1.21 °C cooling effect between November and February. This is despite a snowpack that is twice as insulating in shrubs. The thermal bridging effect is reversed in spring when shrub branches absorb solar radiation and transfer heat to the ground. The overall thermal effect is likely to depend on snow and shrub characteristics and terrain aspect. The inclusion of these thermal bridging processes into climate models may have an important impact on projected greenhouse gas emissions by permafrost.},

  abstract  = {Implicit staggered-grid finite-difference (SGFD) methods are widely used for the first-order acoustic wave-equation modeling. The identical implicit SGFD operator is commonly used for all of the first-order spatial derivatives in the first-order acoustic wave-equation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid explicit implicit SGFD (HEI-SGFD) scheme which could simultaneously preserve the wave-equation simulation accuracy and increase the wave-equation simulation speed. We use a second-order explicit SGFD operator for half of the first-order spatial derivatives in the first-order acoustic wave-equation. At the same time, we use the implicit SGFD operator with added points in the diagonal direction for the other first-order spatial derivatives in the first-order acoustic wave-equation. The proposed HEI-SGFD scheme nearly doubles the wave-equation simulation speed compared to the implicit SGFD schemes. In essence, the proposed HEI-SGFD scheme is equivalent to the second-order FD scheme with ordinary grid format. We then determine the HEI-SGFD coefficients in the time–space domain by minimizing the phase velocity error using the least-squares method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by dispersion analysis and numerical simulations.},

  abstract  = {Significant advances have been made by identifying the levels of synchrony of the underlying dynamics of a given brain state. This research has demonstrated that non-conscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than in conscious states, which are more asynchronous. Here we go beyond this dichotomy to demonstrate that different brain states are underpinned by dissociable spatiotemporal dynamics. We investigated human neuroimaging data from different brain states (resting state, meditation, deep sleep and disorders of consciousness after coma). The model-free approach was based on Kuramoto’s turbulence framework using coupled oscillators. This was extended by a measure of the information cascade across spatial scales. Complementarily, the model-based approach used exhaustive in silico perturbations of whole-brain models fitted to these measures. This allowed studying of the information encoding capabilities in given brain states. Overall, this framework demonstrates that elements from turbulence theory provide excellent tools for describing and differentiating between brain states. A unifying turbulent dynamics framework using both model-free and modelbased measures of whole-brain information provides insights into brain states.},

  abstract  = {Multifidelity surrogates (MFSs) replace computationally intensive models by synergistically combining information from different fidelity data with a significant improvement in modeling efficiency. In this paper, a modified MFS (MMFS) model based on a radial basis function (RBF) is proposed, in which two fidelities of information can be analyzed by adaptively obtaining the scale factor. In the MMFS, an RBF was employed to establish the low-fidelity model. The correlation matrix of the high-fidelity samples and corresponding low-fidelity responses were integrated into an expansion matrix to determine the scaling function parameters. The shape parameters of the basis function were optimized by minimizing the leave-one-out cross-validation error of the high-fidelity sample points. The performance of the MMFS was compared with those of other MFS models (MFS-RBF and cooperative RBF) and single-fidelity RBF using four benchmark test functions, by which the impacts of different high-fidelity sample sizes on the prediction accuracy were also analyzed. The sensitivity of the MMFS model to the randomness of the design of experiments (DoE) was investigated by repeating sampling plans with 20 different DoEs. Stress analysis of the steel plate is presented to highlight the prediction ability of the proposed MMFS model. This research proposes a new multifidelity modeling method that can fully use two fidelity sample sets, rapidly calculate model parameters, and exhibit good prediction accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract  = {Identifying security concerns is a security activity that can be integrated into the requirements development phase. However, it has been shown that manually identifying concerns is a time-consuming and challenging task. The software engineering community has utilized natural language processing and query systems to automatically find part of the requirement specification with a specific concern. This research presents an ontology-based recommender system to suggest security concerns based on use case semantic rules and build on recent studies to find concerns in use cases. Our approach is to model use cases for interface design and map specific parts of use cases to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) based on security concerns at the interaction steps of use cases. We conducted two evaluations, where we generated use case models from Restricted Use Case Modeling (RUCM) descriptions and then used semantic rules to infer where a specific security concern is in the use case models. These evaluations show that the recommender achieves up to 100},

  abstract  = {The control system presently used in shield posture rectification is based on driver experience, which is marginally reliable. The study of the related theory is flawed. Therefore, a decision-making approach for the deviation correction trajectory and posture rectification load for an earth pressure balance (EPB) shield is proposed. A calculation model of posture rectification load of an EPB shield is developed by considering the interactions among the cutter head, shield shell, and ground. The additional position change during the shield attitude correction is highlighted. The posture rectification loads and shield behaviors results can be solved by the proposed method. The influences of the stratum distribution (i.e., bedrock height in the upper-soft and lower-hard strata) on shield behaviors and posture rectification loads are analyzed. Results indicated that the increase of pitch angle in the upper-soft and lower-hard strata causes a sharp rise in vertical displacement. The bedrock height increases the magnitudes of the required posture rectification moments when h _r/ D > 0.5. For a tunnel with h _r/ D ≼ 0.5, the variation of h _r/ D has little effect on the posture rectification moments. Finally, the posture rectifying curves based on the theoretical model are compared with the target ones based on the double circular arc interpolation method. The required results can be obtained regardless of the soil-rock compound stratum distribution. The maximum rectification moment in the rock layer is almost 12.6 times that in the soil layer. Overall, this study provides a valuable reference for moment determination and the trajectory prediction of posture rectification in compound strata.},

The stability of the equilibrium points obtained from the rate equations describing the neuronal circuit based on JJ actuated by a photocurrent is studied. The hysteresis loop widths of current–voltage curves increase with the increase of the damping parameter due to the linear resistor in series with phototube for a constant phototube voltage. Whereas the hysteresis loop of current–voltage curves shifts on the left with the increase of constant phototube voltage. Periodic spiking oscillations, periodic bursting oscillations, continuous spiking oscillations, chaotic spiking oscillations, and chaotic oscillations are found during the numerical analysis by varying the damping parameter due to the linear resistor in series with the phototube and modulation parameters of a sinusoidal voltage of phototube.

  abstract  = {Quantum computing is now a reality, and its incomparable computational power has led companies to show a great interest in being able to work with quantum software in order to support part of their current and future business operations. However, the quantum computing paradigm differs significantly from its classical counterparts, which has brought about the need to revolutionise how the future software is designed, built, and operated in order to work with quantum computers. Since companies cannot discard all their current (and probably mission-critical) information systems, they must adapt their classical information systems to new specific quantum applications, thus evolving towards hybrid information systems. Unfortunately, there are no specific methods with which to deal with this challenge. We believe that reengineering, and more specifically, software modernisation using model-driven engineering principles, could be useful as regard migrating classical systems and existing quantum programs towards hybrid information systems. This paper, therefore, presents QRev, a reverse engineering tool that analyses quantum programs developed in Q# in order to identify its components and interrelationships, and then generates abstract models that can be used in software modernisation processes. The platform-independent models are generated according to the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. QRev is validated in a case study involving five quantum programs in order to demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability. The main implication of the study is that QRev can be used in order to attain KDM models, which can subsequently be employed to restructure or add new quantum functionality at a higher abstraction level, i.e. independently of the specific quantum technology.},

  abstract  = {The decline in snowpack across the western United States is one of the most pressing threats posed by climate change to regional economies and livelihoods. Earth system models are important tools for exploring past and future snowpack variability, yet their coarse spatial resolutions distort local topography and bias spatial patterns of accumulation and ablation. Here, we explore pattern-based statistical downscaling for spatially-continuous interannual snowpack estimates. We find that a few leading patterns capture the majority of snowpack variability across the western US in observations, reanalyses, and free-running simulations. Pattern-based downscaling methods yield accurate, high resolution maps that correct mean and variance biases in domain-wide simulated snowpack. Methods that use large-scale patterns as both predictors and predictands perform better than those that do not and all are superior to an interpolation-based “delta change” approach. These findings suggest that pattern-based methods are appropriate for downscaling interannual snowpack variability and that using physically meaningful large-scale patterns is more important than the details of any particular downscaling method.},

To illustrate, we apply our result to variable selection in linear regression, Gaussian process model with squared exponential covariance function accommodating the covariates, and a first-order autoregressive process with time-varying covariates. We also follow up our theoretical investigations with ample simulation experiments in the above regression contexts and variable selection in a real, riboflavin data consisting of 71 observations and 4088 covariates. For implementation of variable selection using Bayes factors, we develop a novel and effective general-purpose transdimensional, transformation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which has played a crucial role in simulated and real data applications.},

These methods offer significantly greater design freedom and make it possible to develop shape-optimized and function-activated components. In the construction industry, however, these technologies are only being used reluctantly, even though additive methods could make resource-efficient construction possible. The possibly decisive disadvantage of these methods is that a significantly higher granularity of product and process information is required, thus significantly increasing the planning effort. A circumstance that the framework described in this study, fabrication information modeling (FIM), could significantly mitigate by linking digital fabrication and BIM-based digital building design via a digital chain. For this purpose, FIM provides a methodology with which the information of a digital building model can be detailed, component by component, in a fabrication-aware manner. Based on the open exchange data format IFC, the FIM framework integrates seamlessly into the BIM context and enables automated detailing of the design information.},

Comput. 33(2): 786–801, 2011) to approximate the solution of second-order elliptic problems in nonvariational form to incorporate the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework. This is done by viewing the “finite element Hessian” as an auxiliary variable in the formulation. Representing the finite element Hessian in a discontinuous setting yields a linear system of the same size and having the same sparsity pattern of the compact DG methods for variational elliptic problems. Furthermore, the system matrix is very easy to assemble; thus, this approach greatly reduces the computational complexity of the discretisation compared to the continuous approach. We conduct a stability and consistency analysis making use of the unified framework set out in Arnold et al. (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 39(5): 1749–1779, 2001/2002). We also give an a posteriori analysis of the method in the case where the problem has a strong solution. The analysis applies to any consistent representation of the finite element Hessian, and thus is applicable to the previous works making use of continuous Galerkin approximations. Numerical evidence is presented showing that the method works well also in a more general setting.},

However, few studies have been done to address this challenge. The main objective of this document is to provide an optimal model to improve the performance of the left ventricular assist device and reduce costs. In this way, in the present study, the experimental and numerical procedures were developed to analyze the effects of the geometrical features and operational parameters on the performance of a centrifugal blood pump (CBP). Methods In order to achieve this aim, first, experimental tests were carried out to study the influence of the working fluid temperature and the rotational speed on the CBP. Subsequently, the performance of the CBP was assessed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and comparison was made against the experimental data. In addition, the influence of mounting an inducer on the overall performance of CBP was also investigated. Results Good agreement between the CFD and the data was obtained. The CFD results showed that increasing the fluid temperature and rotational speed leads to an increase in the hydraulic efficiency, pressure difference, and power. In addition, the reduction of the pressure difference and hydraulic efficiency with increasing the surface roughness was observed. While mounting an inducer on the pump did not significantly impact its overall performance, the highest value of the wall shear stress dropped moderately on the impeller and, therefore, unveiled the possibility of improving the performance of such designs.},

So, it had to be studied the behavior of oxytactic microorganisms and nanoparticle and their roles in the drug-carriers system. All non-dimensional physical parameters are supposed to be variable as the viscosity of blood variable with fluid temperature and nanoparticle concentration. This system of partial differential equations was formulated and transformed mathematically using new theories of differential transform method combined by Pade' approximation (DTM-Pade′). The solution of the mentioned system is displayed digitally in tables and graphically in sketches. The existing study assured that the microorganism density in the direction near to the hypoxic tumor tissues regions grows with a rising in oxygen concentrations and the blood viscosity diminutions.

The affective realism hypothesis proposes that a brain continually predicts the meaning of sensations (e.g., identifying a sound as a siren, or a visual array as a face) in part by representing the current state of the body and the immediate physiological impact that similar sensory events have entailed in the past. However, the precise contribution of physiological activity to experiences of affective realism remains unknown. In the present study, participants’ peripheral physiological activity was recorded while they made social evaluative judgments of target faces displaying neutral expressions. Target faces were shown concurrent with affective images that were suppressed from reportable awareness using continuous flash suppression. Results revealed evidence of affective realism—participants judged target faces more positively when paired with suppressed positive stimuli than suppressed negative stimuli—but this effect was significantly less pronounced among individuals higher in cardiac interoceptive sensitivity. Moreover, while some modest differences in peripheral physiological activity were observed across suppressed affective stimulus conditions, physiological reactivity to affective stimuli did not directly predict social evaluative judgments. We explore the implications of these findings with respect to both theories of emotion and theories detailing a role for interoception in experiences of first-person subjectivity.},

In this study, an approach to anomaly detection was performed on a real-world bridge using temperature and rotation data collected by a structural health monitoring system. First, the state equation of a beam under a quasi-static process was established based on thermodynamics. The state equation was then validated through a case study. Subsequently, the thermodynamics state equation of rotation and Bayesian theory were combined to obtain a double-index anomaly detection method, which was applied to a real-world bridge. The results showed that the double-index method effectively detected the bridge anomaly, and the anomaly of the bridge was induced by ice and snow loads. This work provides a thermodynamic perspective for diagnosis in civil structures.},

The low voltage-ride through (LVRT) capability is one among the obligations of all grid code standards. The LVRT capability can be enhanced by controlling the power electronic converters without any additional cost. This work proposes a novel adaptive hysteresis controller (AHC) for the LVRT capability enhancement of grid connected double-feed induction generator (DFIG)-driven WEC system. The active and reactive power flow at the DFIG is managed by modified PQ controller, and the results are compared with PQ controller. The DC link voltage (V_dc) under normal and fault conditions is controlled by fuzzy logic control (FLC). The proposed AHC controller is tested with 9 MW grid connected WEC system on Matlab/Simulink platform, and a detailed simulation was carried out under normal and fault conditions. The test results disclose the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {Language scientists often need to generate lists of related words, such as potential competitors. They may do this for purposes of experimental control (e.g., selecting items matched on lexical neighborhood but varying in word frequency), or to test theoretical predictions (e.g., hypothesizing that a novel type of competitor may impact word recognition). Several online tools are available, but most are constrained to a fixed lexicon and fixed sets of competitor definitions, and may not give the user full access to or control of source data. We present LexFindR , an open-source R package that can be easily modified to include additional, novel competitor types. LexFindR is easy to use. Because it can leverage multiple CPU cores and uses vectorized code when possible, it is also extremely fast. In this article, we present an overview of LexFindR usage, illustrated with examples. We also explain the details of how we implemented several standard lexical competitor types used in spoken word recognition research (e.g., cohorts, neighbors, embeddings, rhymes), and show how “lexical dimensions” (e.g., word frequency, word length, uniqueness point) can be integrated into LexFindR workflows (for example, to calculate “frequency-weighted competitor probabilities”), for both spoken and visual word recognition research.},

  abstract  = {In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), it is common practice to select process parameters to achieve high density parts starting from simple geometries such as cubes or cylinders. However, additive manufacturing is usually adopted to produce very complex geometries, where parameters should be tuned locally, depending on the local features to be processed. In fact, geometrical features, such as overhangs, acute corners, and thin walls may lead to over- or under-heating conditions, which may result in geometrical inaccuracy, high roughness, volumetric errors (i.e., porosity) or even job failure due to surface collapse. This work proposes a layer-wise control strategy to improve the geometrical precision of overhanging regions using a coaxial melt pool monitoring system. The melt-pool images acquired at each layer are used in a control-loop to adapt the process parameters locally at the next layer in order to minimize surface defects. In particular, the laser duty cycle is used as a controllable parameter to correct the energy density. This work presents the main architecture of the proposed approach, the control strategy and the experimental procedure that need to be applied to design the control parameters. The layer-wise control strategy was tested on AISI 316L stainless steel using an open LPFB platform. The results showed that the proposed layer-wise control solution results in a constant melt pool observed via the laser heated area size starting from the second layer onward, leading to a significant improvement in the geometrical accuracy of 5 mm-long bridge geometries.},

  year      = {2022},

  number    = {2},
  volume    = {16},
  abstract  = {This paper presents, as far as the authors are aware, a complete and extended new taxonomy of shape specification modeling techniques and a characterization of shape design systems, all based on the relationship of users’ knowledge to the modeling system they use to generate shapes. In-depth knowledge of this relationship is not usually revealed in the regular university training courses such as bachelor’s, master’s and continuing education. For this reason, we believe that it is necessary to modify the learning process, offering a more global vision of all the currently existing techniques and extending training in those related to algorithmic modeling techniques. We consider the latter to be the most powerful current techniques for modeling complex shapes that cannot be modeled with the usual techniques known to date. Therefore, the most complete training should include everything from the usual geometry to textual programming. This would take us a step further along the way to more powerful design environments. The proposed taxonomy could serve as a guideline to help improve the learning process of students and designers in a complex environment with increasingly powerful requirements and tools. The term “smart” is widely used nowadays, e.g. smart phones, smart cars, smart homes, smart cities... and similar terms such as “smart shape modeling”. Nowadays, the term smart is applied from a marketing point of view, whenever an innovation is used to solve a complex problem. This is the case for what is currently called smart shape modeling. However, in the future; this concept should mean a much better design environment than today. The smart future requires better trained and skilled engineers, architects, designers or technical students. This means that they must be prepared to be able to contribute to the creation of new knowledge, to the use of innovations to solve complex problems of form, and to the extraction of the relevant pieces of intelligence from the growing volume of knowledge and technologies accessible today. Our taxonomy is presented from the point of view of methods that are possibly furthest away from what is considered today as “intelligent shape modeling” to the limit of what is achievable today and which the authors call “Generic Shape Algorithm”. Finally, we discuss the characteristics that a shape modeling system must have to be truly “intelligent”: it must be “proactive” in applying innovative ideas to achieve a solution to a complex problem.},

  abstract  = {Previous work has shown that taint analyses are only useful if correctly customized to the context in which they are used. Existing domain-specific languages (DSLs) allow such customization through the definition of deny-listing data-flow rules that describe potentially vulnerable or malicious taint-flows. These languages, however, are designed primarily for security experts who are expected to be knowledgeable in taint analysis. Software developers, however, consider these languages to be complex. This paper thus presents fluent TQL, a query specification language particularly for taint-flows. fluent TQL is internal Java DSL and uses a fluent-interface design. fluent TQL queries can express various taint-style vulnerability types, e.g. injections, cross-site scripting or path traversal. This paper describes fluent TQL’s abstract and concrete syntax and defines its runtime semantics. The semantics are independent of any underlying analysis and allows evaluation of fluent TQL queries by a variety of taint analyses. Instantiations of fluent TQL, on top of two taint analysis solvers, Boomerang and FlowDroid, show and validate fluent TQL expressiveness. Based on existing examples from the literature, we have used fluent TQL to implement queries for 11 popular security vulnerability types in Java. Using our SQL injection specification, the Boomerang-based taint analysis found all 17 known taint-flows in the OWASP WebGoat application, whereas with FlowDroid 13 taint-flows were found. Similarly, in a vulnerable version of the Java Spring PetClinic application, the Boomerang-based taint analysis found all seven expected taint-flows. In seven real-world Android apps with 25 expected malicious taint-flows, 18 taint-flows were detected. In a user study with 26 software developers, fluent TQL reached a high usability score. In comparison to CodeQL , the state-of-the-art DSL by Semmle/GitHub, participants found fluent TQL more usable and with it they were able to specify taint analysis queries in shorter time.},

  abstract  = {Cloud Platforms are heterogeneous, and users may face interoperability issues migrating applications or exchanging data among distinct clouds due, for instance, to the lack of standards solutions. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome lock-in situations, and middleware platforms are one of them. A semantic interoperability solution named middleware for Data as a Service (DaaS)/Database as a Service (DBaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)—MIDAS has been developed to overcome this lock-in issue. It is an intermediate communication layer to retrieve data from DaaS or DBaaS through a Structured Query Language (SQL) or a Not Only SQL (NoSQL) created at the SaaS level. MIDAS is a platform for software execution, but software development needs support for its entire life cycle. Therefore, we propose the Model drIven Approach for MIDAS (MIAMI), which enables the specification of platform-independent middleware models and their use to generate code on different cloud platforms. MIAMI comprises a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) that enables middleware models and a transformation specification, which defines how these models can be converted to code. MIAMI offers a strategy for MIDAS specification and code generation phases to help middleware developers’ activities. MIAMI was applied to code generation specifications in Cloud Foundry, Amazon Web Services, OpenShift, and Heroku providers to evaluate our approach. This specification shows MIAMI’s feasibility and points out that MDD is a promising approach to improving cloud interoperability solutions.},

In this study, the authors demonstrate that the SRSF1 splicing factor is essential to sustain the stem cell phenotype of WNT-activated colorectal cancers. Tumour cell plasticity is a major barrier to the efficacy of targeted cancer therapies but the mechanisms that mediate it are poorly understood. Here, we identify dysregulated RNA splicing as a key driver of tumour cell dedifferentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC). We find that Apc -deficient CRC cells have dysregulated RNA splicing machinery and exhibit global rewiring of RNA splicing. We show that the splicing factor SRSF1 controls the plasticity of tumour cells by controlling Kras splicing and is required for CRC invasion in a mouse model of carcinogenesis. SRSF1 expression maintains stemness in human CRC organoids and correlates with cancer stem cell marker expression in human tumours. Crucially, partial genetic downregulation of Srsf1 does not detrimentally affect normal tissue homeostasis, demonstrating that tumour cell plasticity can be differentially targeted. Thus, our findings link dysregulation of the RNA splicing machinery and control of tumour cell plasticity.},

However, serial links driven by multiarticular muscles can cause unstable motion (e.g., buckling). The stability of musculoskeletal mechanisms driven by antagonistic multiarticular muscles depends on the muscle configuration, origin/insertion of muscles, spring constants of muscles, contracting force of muscles, and other factors. We analyze the stability of a multi-serial-link mechanism driven by antagonistic multiarticular muscles aiming to avoid buckling and other undesired motions. We theoretically derive the potential energy of the system and the stable condition at the target point, and validate the results through dynamic simulations and experiments. This paper presents the static stability criteria of serially linked robots, which are redundantly driven by monoarticular and multiarticular muscles, resulting in the design and control guidelines for those robots.},

At present, existing LEH assessment research has mainly focused on the single measurement of landscape pattern or external ecological service function, ignoring the effect mechanism. Moreover, there is a lack of targeted assessment of urban blue–green space LEH. In this study, we constructed an urban blue–green space LEH assessment framework based on the integration of pattern, process, function and sustainability, and conducted an empirical analysis in Harbin, a megacity in Northeastern China. The results showed that the spatial changes in the four assessment units of landscape ecological pattern, process, function and sustainability were not coordinated in the study area. From 2011 to 2020, the overall condition of blue–green space LEH in the study area improved but still at an unhealthy level, and the spatial difference increased. Grassland, water and wetland suffered from the widespread degradation of LEH in the study area, and the LEH level improvement type had the largest area proportion, and the stabilization type had the smallest. Moreover, based on the spatial autocorrelation analysis, we clarified the LEH spatial correlation characteristics of the study area and proposed targeted optimization suggestions. Our assessment framework will extend the LEH assessment scope and methodology, and the research results can provide significant references for urban blue–green space protection and management.},

  abstract  = {Reservoir-induced landslides are a common type of geological hazards in the hydropower area, where the frequent occurrence of catastrophic landslides has attracted widespread attention. This study focuses on the Huangtupo Riverside Slump 1#, a reservoir-induced landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China, which has been investigated with double sliding surfaces. First, a series of numerical analyses are conducted to obtain the seepage field inside the landslide subjected to fluctuation of reservoir water level. Then the stability of the landslide is analyzed by employing the results of the seepage field. Subsequently, considering the uncertainty of strength parameters of sliding surfaces, the failure probabilities for the individual sliding surfaces are assessed via first order reliability method, and then the system reliability of the landslide is analyzed by applying the Ditlevsen’s bounds method. The results indicate that the change of seepage field is closely related to the scheduling of reservoir water level and lags behind the scheduling, which has a greater impact on the stability of the 1–1# failure surface than the 1–2# failure surface. Similarly, the bounds of system failure probability vary with the reservoir water level, and the most dangerous probability occurs when the water drops to the lowest level. Evaluating the landslide from the perspective of system reliability greatly narrows the risk range, which has potential for further application in risk management and control. Besides, the relationships between the correlation coefficient of strength parameters and the landslide system response are discussed through parametric analyses.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we investigate ratchet effect of active particles in biased velocity potential in the presence of cross-correlated noises. For a single active particle, the mean velocity and mobility suggest that cross-correlated noises can lead to the ratchet effect. The finding is interpreted by the time series, the rectified potential, mean square displacement, and the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion displays hyperdiffusion, superdiffusion, and normal diffusion for different conditions and time intervals. The crossover times that separates these stages can be controlled by cross-correlated noises and static force. For interacting active particles, we find through time series and average velocity that the weak interaction between particles, which leads to weak collective motion, can enhance the ratchet effect. However, the strong interaction, which results in strong collective motion, can weaken, even eliminate it. Our results may provide a valuable way to control the transport of active particles through the ratchet effect. Graphic abstract },

  abstract  = {Decision-making processes and decision support systems (DSS) have been improved by a variety of methods originated from several scientific fields, such as information science and artificial intelligence (AI). Situated visualization (SV) allows presenting visual data representations in context and may support better DSS. Its main characteristic is to display data representations near the data referent. As augmented reality (AR) is becoming more mature, affordable, and widespread, using it as a tool for SV becomes viable in several situations. Moreover, it may provide a positive contribution to more effective and efficient decision-making, as the users have contextual, relevant, and appropriate information that fosters more informed choices. As new challenges and opportunities arise, it is important to understand the relevance of intertwining these fields. Based on literature analysis, this paper introduces the main concepts involved, and, through practical examples, addresses and discusses current areas of application, benefits, challenges, and opportunities of using SV through AR to visualize data in context to support better decision-making processes. In the end, a set of guidelines for the design and implementation of DSS based on situated augmented reality are proposed.},

Smartphones and smartwatches have become an essential tool for visually impaired and blind people in performing daily life activities, promoting independence, productivity, and self-reliance. The accessibility services such as talkback and voice assistants facilitate blind people in using smartphones to perform several activities such as placing calls, sharing pictures, reading books, and sending messages, etc. However, existing accessibility services face several problems, including late learning, accessing, and selecting non-visual items on the screen, finding objects of interest in a complex layout, multimodal interaction, and operating multiple connected devices. One solution to these problems is to design a blind-friendly interface to simplify and distribute User Interface Artefacts (UIAs), including labels, buttons, layouts, and panels across multiple devices. The framework tailor’s UI components into simplified blind-friendly user interfaces on smartphones and smartwatches, resulting in improving the user experience. Forty-nine blind people have participated in this empirical study revealing a considerable improvement in the user experience, task completion accuracy, and productivity.},

  abstract  = {Fracturing in rocks results in the formation of an inelastic region surrounding the crack tip called the fracture process zone (FPZ), which is often characterized using the Linear Cohesive Zone Model (LCZM). Various numerical studies have shown that the prediction of the FPZ characteristics is significantly influenced by variability in the input parameters of LCZM, such as crack tip opening displacement and tensile strength. In this study, an integrated approach was used for evaluating the LCZM performance in predicting fracture processes of Barre granite specimens, as a representative rock, under Mode I loading. The approach involved experimental testing, numerical simulation, uncertainty quantification of overall fracture behavior, and global sensitivity analysis. First, parameters of the LCZM were estimated from three-point bending tests on center notch Barre granite specimen using the two-dimensional digital image correlation (2D-DIC) technique. This was followed by the implementation of the LCZM in XFEM-based numerical model to simulate the evolution of the FPZ in tested geometry. The results from the deterministic numerical simulation showed that while LCZM can predict all stages of FPZ evolution, the variability in the experimental results, such as the FPZ size, cannot be accounted. The variability of the material response was quantified using a random variable analysis, which involved treating the LCZM’s parameters as random variables. This was followed by the global sensitivity analysis that revealed the most sensitive input parameters is the tensile strength for accurate prediction of the global response of rock specimens under Mode I loading.},

  abstract  = {Biped robots have attracted wide attention in exploring the mechanism of human walking, and are expected to provide rich application scenarios. Nonetheless, stable and effective gait generation is not easy to achieve. At present, the mainstream biped walking control method similar to full drive does not fully consider and make use of the dynamics of the robot itself, resulting in low walking efficiency. To overcome this problem, an indirect method has been recently introduced to leverage the natural dynamics of passive dynamic walking. In this work, we introduce a more straightforward approach to strengthen its implementation ability. First, we introduce the modeling and control method of the compass-like robot with semicircular feet. Second, we conduct numerical simulations to observe the typical gait and analyze its results. Third, we investigated the effect of feed-forward control on walking performance. Moreover, a Poincaré map is used to test the stability of the system.},

  abstract  = {Collections of large ensembles of regional climate model (RCM) downscaled climate data for particular regions and scenarios can be organized in a usually incomplete matrix consisting of GCM (global climate model) x RCM combinations. When simple ensemble averages are calculated, each GCM will effectively be weighted by the number of times it has been downscaled. In order to facilitate more equal and less arbitrary weighting among downscaled GCM results, we present a method to emulate the missing combinations in such a matrix, enabling equal weighting among participating GCMs and hence among regional consequences of large-scale climate change simulated by each GCM. This method is based on a traditional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach. The method is applied and studied for fields of seasonal average temperature, precipitation and surface wind and for the 10-year return value of daily precipitation and of 10-m wind speed for a completely filled matrix consisting of 5 GCMs and 4 RCMs. We quantify the skill of the two averaging methods for different numbers of missing simulations and show that ensembles where lacking members have been emulated by the ANOVA technique are better at representing the full ensemble than corresponding simple ensemble averages, particularly in cases where only a few model combinations are absent. The technique breaks down when the number of missing simulations reaches the sum of the numbers of GCMs and RCMs. Also, the method is only useful when inter-simulation variability is limited. This is the case for the average fields that have been studied, but not for the extremes. We have developed analytical expressions for the degree of improvement obtained with the present method, which quantify this conclusion.},

  abstract  = {Location-enabled Internet of things (IoT) has attracted much attention from the scientific and industrial communities given its high relevance in application domains such as agriculture, wildlife management, and infectious disease control. The frequency and accuracy of location information plays an important role in the success of these applications. However, frequent and accurate self-localization of IoT devices is challenging due to their resource-constrained nature. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for self-localization of IoT devices using noisy received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements and perturbed anchor node position estimates. In the proposed algorithm, we minimize a weighted sum-square-distance-error cost function in an iterative fashion utilizing the gradient-descent method. We calculate the weights using the statistical properties of the perturbations in the measurements. We assume log-normal distribution for the RSSI-induced distance estimates due to considering the log-distance path-loss model with normally-distributed perturbations for the RSSI measurements in the logarithmic scale. We also assume normally-distributed perturbation in the anchor position estimates. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of an existing algorithm that takes a similar approach but only accounts for the perturbations in the RSSI measurements. Our simulation results show that by taking into account the error in the anchor positions, a significant improvement in the localization accuracy can be achieved. The proposed algorithm uses only a single measurement of RSSI and one estimate of each anchor position. This makes the proposed algorithm suitable for frequent and accurate localization of IoT devices.},

  abstract  = {Here, we analyze future projections of cyclone activity in the Mediterranean region at the end of the twenty-first century based on an ensemble of state-of-the-art fully-coupled Regional Climate System Models (RCSMs) from the Med-CORDEX initiative under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Despite some noticeable biases, all the RCSMs capture spatial patterns and cyclone activity key characteristics in the region and thus all of them can be considered as plausible representations of the future evolution of Mediterranean cyclones. In general, the RCSMs show at the end of the twenty-first century a decrease in the number and an overall weakening of cyclones moving across the Mediterranean. Five out of seven RCSMs simulate also a decrease of the mean size of the systems. Moreover, in agreement with what already observed in CMIP5 projections for the area, the models suggest an increase in the Central part of the Mediterranean region and a decrease in the South-eastern part of the region in the cyclone-related wind speed and precipitation rate. These rather two opposite tendencies observed in the precipitation should compensate and amplify, respectively, the effect of the overall reduction of the frequency of cyclones on the water budget over the Central and South-eastern part of the region. A pronounced inter-model spread among the RCSMs emerges for the projected changes in the cyclone adjusted deepening rate, seasonal cycle occurrence and associated precipitation and wind patterns over some areas of the basin such as Ionian Sea and Iberian Peninsula. The differences observed appear to be determined by the driving Global Circulation Model (GCM) and influenced by the RCSM physics and internal variability. These results point to the importance of (1) better characterizing the range of plausible futures by relying on ensembles of models that explore well the existing diversity of GCMs and RCSMs as well as the climate natural variability and (2) better understanding the driving mechanisms of the future evolution of Mediterranean cyclones properties.},

  abstract  = {A modelagem hidrológica integrada (MHI) constitui a ferramenta a mais adequada para investigar as interações entre águas superficiais e águas subterrâneas em sistemas hidrológicos complexos, tais como sistemas de rocha cristalina (SRC), particularmente se localizados em ambientes limitados em água (ALA). Tais condições SRC-ALA são preenchidas na bacia hidrográfica Sardon ( 80 km^2) em Espanha, na qual o modelo MODFLOW 6 foi testado, aplicando as seguintes melhorias em relação a trabalhos anteriores nessa bacia hidrográfica: novo modelo conceitual, forças motrizes redefinidas com base em dados de sensoriamento remoto, uma grade não estruturada de Voronoi e, o mais importante, um novo conceito de roteamento e reinfiltração em cascata (RRC). No MODFLOW 6 padrão, a infiltração rejeitada e a exfiltração das águas subterrâneas sempre foram consideradas como sumidouros (evaporação). No entanto, na realidade, essa água pode não só evaporar, mas também reinfiltrar de volta à subsuperfície ou escoar para as linhas de água de drenagem. O RRC melhora as interações superfície-zona não saturada e também as interações entre águas superficiais e águas subterrâneas. As capacidades padrão e novas do MODFLOW 6 são apresentadas no modelo transitório da bacia hidrográfica de Sardon, calibrado utilizando 7 anos de medições pontuais e diárias dos níveis piezométricos da água subterrânea e do caudal da linha de água superficial principal. Os resultados mostraram: a grande variabilidade espaço-temporal dos fluxos de águas subterrâneas, o papel substancial da exfiltração das águas subterrâneas, o baixo armazenamento da bacia hidrográfica, a rápida reação do lençol freático e dos fluxos, e o caráter de mosaico da recarga real. Estas características são típicas da SRC-ALA com um lençol freático pouco profundo. O MODFLOW 6 tem muitas melhorias em comparação com as versões anteriores do MODFLOW, portanto, com o conceito RRC proposto (ainda pode ser melhorado), o MODFLOW 6 de ambiente único tem capacidade de modelação comparável com as SRCs multiambientais, sendo ao mesmo tempo mais flexível e mais eficiente. Geïntegreerde hydrologische modellering (IHM) kan oppervlaktewater/grondwater interacties betrouwbaar karakteriseren in complexe hydrologische systemen, bijvoorbeeld hardgesteente systemen (HRS), gelegen in waterbeperkte omgevingen (WLE). Zulke HRS-WLE omstandigheden worden gerepresenteerd door het Sardon catchment ( 80 km2) in Spanje, waar de MODFLOW 6 modelleeromgeving is getest, met toepassing van de volgende verbeteringen in vergelijking met eerder werk voor dit stroomgebied: een nieuw conceptueel model, drijvende krachten geherdefinieerd op basis van remote sensing data, een ongestructureerd Voronoi grid en, als belangrijkste, een nieuw cascade-routing en herinfiltratie (CRR) concept. In de standaard MODFLOW 6 worden verworpen infiltratie en grondwaterexfiltratie beschouwd als ‘sinks’ (verdamping). Echter, in werkelijkheid kan dat water niet alleen verdampen maar ook herinfiltreren naar de ondergrond of als ‘runoff’ vervoerd worden naar het afwateringssysteem. De CRR verbetert oppervlakte-onverzadigde zone interacties en oppervlakte/grondwater-interacties. De standaard en nieuwe capaciteiten van MODFLOW 6 zijn gepresenteerd in het ‘transient’ model van het Sardon stroomgebied, gekalibreerd met 7 jaar aan dagelijkse grondwaterstanden en beekafvoeren. De resultaten laten zien: de hoge ruimtelijke en temporele variabiliteit van grondwaterfluxen, de substantiële rol van grondwaterexfiltratie, de lage stroomgebiedopslag, de snelle reactie van waterstand en beken, en het mozaïeken karakter van de netto grondwateraanvulling. Deze karakteristieken zijn kenmerkend voor HRS-WLE’s met een ondiepe grondwaterstand. MODFLOW 6 heeft veel verbeteringen in vergelijking met eerdere MODFLOW versies, dus met het voorgestelde CRR concept (kan nog verbeterd worden) heeft de enkelvoudige-omgeving MODFLOW 6 vergelijkbare modelcapaciteiten als meervoudige-omgeving IHM’s, terwijl ze flexibeler en efficiënter zijn. Integrated hydrological modelling (IHM) can reliably characterize surface-water/groundwater interactions in complex hydrological systems such as hard-rock systems (HRS), located in water-limited environments (WLE). Such HRS-WLE conditions are represented by Sardon catchment ( 80 km^2) in Spain, where the MODFLOW 6 modelling environment was tested, applying the following improvements as compared to previous works in that catchment: a new conceptual model, driving forces redefined based on remote sensing data, an unstructured Voronoi grid, and, most importantly, a novel cascade-routing and reinfiltration (CRR) concept. In the standard MODFLOW 6, rejected infiltration and groundwater exfiltration have always been considered as sinks (evaporation). However, in reality, that water can not only evaporate but also reinfiltrate back to the subsurface or move as runoff towards drainage water bodies. The CRR improves surface–unsaturated-zone interactions and also surface-water/groundwater interactions. The standard and new capacities of MODFLOW 6 are presented in the transient model of the Sardon catchment, calibrated using 7 years of daily groundwater heads and streamflows. The results showed: the large spatio-temporal variability of the groundwater fluxes, the substantial role of groundwater exfiltration, the low catchment storage, the fast reaction of the water table and streams to rainfall, and the mosaic character of the net recharge. These characteristics are typical for HRS-WLEs with a shallow water table. MODFLOW 6 has many improvements compared to previous MODFLOW versions, so with the proposed CRR concept (still can be improved), the single-environment MODFLOW 6 has modelling capacity comparable with multienvironment IHMs, while being more flexible and more efficient. 综合水文模型(IHM)能够可靠地描述复杂水文系统中地表水/地下水的相互作用, 例如位于水限制环境(WLE)中的硬岩系统(HRS)。此类HRS-WLE条件以西班牙Sardon流域( 80 km2)为代表, 在那里应用了MODFLOW 6建模, 与该流域以前的工作相比采用以下改进措施:新的概念模型、基于遥感数据重新定义的驱动力、非结构化Voronoi网格, 最重要的是, 一种新的级联路径和再入渗(CRR)概念。在标准MODFLOW 6中, 无效入渗和地下水渗出一直被视为汇(蒸发)。然而, 在现实中, 这些水不仅可以蒸发, 还可以重新入渗到地下, 或者作为径流流向地表水体。CRR改善了地表-非饱和带的相互作用以及地表水/地下水的相互作用。在Sardon流域的瞬态模型中应用了标准以及改进的MODFLOW 6模型, 并使用7年的每日地下水水头和流量进行校准。结果表明:地下水通量具有较大的时空变异性、地下水渗出的重要作用、较低的流域蓄水量、地下水位和河流的快速响应以及净补给的镶嵌特征。这些特征是具有浅水位HRS-WLE条件的典型特征。与以前的MODFLOW版本相比, MODFLOW 6有许多改进, 因此, 通过提出的CRR概念(仍可以改进), 单环境MODFLOW 6的建模能力与多环境IHMs相当, 同时更灵活、更高效。  El modelado hidrológico integrado (IHM) puede caracterizar de forma fidedigna las interacciones entre las aguas superficiales y subterráneas en sistemas hidrológicos complejos, como los sistemas de roca dura (HRS), situados en ambientes de agua limitada (WLE). Dichas condiciones de HRS-WLE están representadas por la cuenca de Sardón ( 80 km^2) en España, donde se probó el entorno de modelado de MODFLOW 6, aplicando las siguientes mejoras en comparación con trabajos anteriores en dicha cuenca: un nuevo modelo conceptual, fuerzas motrices redefinidas en base a datos de teledetección, una malla de Voronoi no estructurada y, lo más importante, un nuevo concepto de desvío en cascada y reinfiltración (CRR). En el MODFLOW 6 estándar, la infiltración rechazada y la exfiltración de aguas subterráneas se han considerado siempre como sumideros (evaporación). Sin embargo, en la realidad, esa agua no sólo puede evaporarse, sino también reinfiltrarse de nuevo al subsuelo o moverse como escorrentía hacia las cuencas hidrográficas. El CRR mejora las interacciones superficie-zona no saturada y también las interacciones superficie-agua subterránea. Las capacidades estándar y las capacidades propias de MODFLOW 6 se presentan en el modelo transitorio de la cuenca de Sardón, calibrado a partir de 7 años de niveles de agua subterránea y caudales diarios. Los resultados mostraron: la gran variabilidad espacio-temporal de los flujos de aguas subterráneas, el papel sustancial de la exfiltración de aguas subterráneas, el bajo almacenamiento de la cuenca, la rápida reacción de la capa freática y los arroyos, y el carácter de mosaico de la recarga neta. Estas características son típicas de las HRS-WLEs con un nivel freático poco profundo. MODFLOW 6 tiene muchas mejoras en comparación con las versiones anteriores de MODFLOW, por lo que, con el concepto de CRR propuesto (que aún puede mejorarse), el MODFLOW 6 de un solo entorno tiene una capacidad de modelado comparable a la de los IHM de varios entornos, siendo al mismo tiempo más flexible y eficiente. La modellistica idrologica integrate (IHM) può caratterizzare in modo affidabile l’interazione tra acque superficiali e di falda in sistemi idrologici complessi, come nel caso dei sistemi di rocce fratturate (HRS), situati in ambienti siccitosi (WLE). Queste condizioni HRS-WLE sono ben rappresentate nel bacino di Sardon ( 80 km^2), in Spagna, dove il sistema di modellazione MODFLOW 6 è stato testato applicando i seguenti miglioramenti rispetto ai precedenti lavori condotti sul medesimo bacino: un nuovo modello concettuale, variabili rilevanti ridefinite basandosi su dati satellitari, uso di una griglia non-strutturata di Voronoi e, soprattutto, un innovativo concetto di percorso a cascata e reinfiltrazione (CRR). Nella versione standard di MODFLOW 6 il surplus rispetto all’infiltrazione e l’acqua di falda estratta sono sempre state considerate come delle perdite nette (evaporazione). Eppure quella quantità di acqua non solo può evaporare, ma anche reinfiltrarsi nel sottosuolo o muoversi come ruscellamento verso i corpi idrici di drenaggio. Il CRR migliora l’interazione tra le superficiali–zona-insatura, e tra le superficiali-acque/di falda. Sia le capacità standard che le nuove del modello MODFLOW 6 sono state utilizzate nella modellazione del bacino di Sardon, calibrato usando 7 anni di dati giornalieri sulla profondità della tavola d’acqua e sulle portate del torrente di drenaggio. I risultati mostrano: la grande variabilità spazio-temporale dei flussi di falda, il ruolo importante dell’estrazione di acqua di falda, la bassa capacità idraulica del bacino idrologico, la veloce reazione della tavola d’acqua e dei corsi d’acqua, e il carattere a mosaico della ricarica netta. Queste caratteristiche sono tipiche delle condizioni HRS-WLE con una tavola d’acqua poco profonda. MODFLOW 6 mostra miglioramenti rispetto alle versioni MODFLOW precedenti; quindi, con il concetto CRR qui proposto (che può ancora essere migliorato), il modello ad ambiente singolo MODFLOW 6 ha capacità comparabili alle versioni multi-ambiente IHM, rimanendo più flessibile e più efficiente. Zintegrowane modele hydrologiczne wiarygodnie charakteryzują interakcje pomiędzy wodami powierzchniowymi i podziemnymi w kompleksowych systemach wodonośnych, takich jak skały szczelinowate w obszarach o klimatycznie ograniczonych zasobach wodnych. W jednym z takich obszarów, jak ten reprezentowany przez zlewnię Sardon ( 80 km2) w Hiszpanii, model MODFLOW 6 był testowany i wprowadzono następujące ulepszenia w porównaniu do poprzednich rozwiązań modelowych w tej zlewni: nowy model koncepcyjny, ulepszone zmienne kontrolne dzięki zastosowaniu teledetekcji, nieregularną siatkę Voronoi oraz co najważniejsze, wprowadzono do MODFLOW 6 oryginalną metodę kaskadowego-trasowania i reinfiltracji (CRR). W standardowej wersji MODLFOW 6, odrzucona przez model infiltracja, była dotychczas traktowana jako strata na ewaporację, podczas gdy w rzeczywistości ta porcja wody może nie tylko ewaporować ale również spływać w kierunku drenujących zbiorników wód powierzchniowych oraz infiltrować pod powierzchnię gruntu. Metoda CRR poprawia system współdziałania wód powierzchniowych z wodami strefy aeracji oraz wód strefy aeracji z wodami gruntowymi. Standardowe oraz nowe możliwości MODFLOW 6 przedstawione są na przykładzie modelu dla warunków nieustalonych w zlewni Sardon, kalibrowanego z użyciem dziennych stanów zwierciadła wód podziemnych i odpływu rzeki Sardon. Wykalibrowany model pokazał: dużą czaso-przestrzenną zmienność składników bilansu wód podziemnych, istotną rolę exfiltracji wód podziemnych, małą pojemność wodną zlewni, szybką reakcję zwierciadła wód gruntowych i rzek oraz mozaikowy charakter infiltracji efektywnej. Cechy te są charakterystyczne dla obszarów skał szczelinowatych zlokalizowanych w obszarach o klimatycznie-ograniczonych zasobach wodnych oraz płytkim zwierciadle wód podziemnych. MODFLOW 6 posiada wiele ulepszeń w porównaniu do poprzednich wersji, a wraz z zaproponowaną metodą CRR (która też może być ulepszona), jedno-środowiskowy, zintegrowany model hydrologiczny MODFLOW 6, posiada możliwości porównywalne z wielo-środowiskowymi zintegrowanymi modelami hydrologicznymi, jednocześnie będąc narzędziem bardziej elastycznym oraz bardzie wydajnym. Integrierte hydrologische Modellierung (IHM) kann die Interaktionen zwischen Oberflächenwasser/Grundwasser in komplexen hydrologischen Systemen zuverlässig beschreiben, zum Beispiel in Systemen aus hartem Gestein (HRS) in wasserarmen Gegenden (WLE). Diese HRS-WLE Bedingungen sind im Sardon Einzugsgebiet ( 80 km²) in Spanien zu finden, für das die MODFLOW 6 Modellierungsumgebung getestet wurde. Dabei wurden die folgenden Verbesserungen im Vergleich zu vorangegangenen Arbeiten in diesem Einzugsgebiet angebracht: Ein neues konzeptuelles Modell, die Neudefinition der Antriebskräfte auf Basis von Fernerkundungsdaten, ein unstrukturiertes Voronoi-Gitter und, am wichtigsten, ein neuartiges Konzept zum kaskadierenden Abfließen und zum Wiedereinsickern (CRR). Im bisherigen MODFLOW 6 wurden nicht versickernde Niederschläge und Grundwasseraustritt immer als Senke (Verdunstung) betrachtet. In der Realität kann dieses Wasser jedoch nicht nur verdunsten, sondern auch in den Untergrund zurücksickern oder in Drainagegewässer abfließen. Das CRR verbessert die Interaktionen zwischen der Oberfläche und den ungesättigten Zonen, sowie zwischen Oberflächenwasser/Grundwasser. Die vorhandenen und neuen Funktionen von MODFLOW 6 werden für das Modell im Sardon Einzugsgebiet präsentiert, wobei sie mit Daten für Grundwasserdruckhöhe und Flussabflussmengen von sieben Jahren kalibriert werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigten: Die große räumliche und zeitliche Variabilität der Grundwasserströme, die erhebliche Rolle des Grundwasseraustritts, die geringe Speichermenge des Einzugsgebiet, die schnelle Reaktion von Grundwasseroberfläche und -strömen, sowie der mosaikartige Charakter der netto Grundwasseranreicherung. Diese Eigenschaften sind typisch für HRS-WLE Systeme mit einer geringen Höhe der Grundwasseroberfläche. MODFLOW 6 beinhaltet viele Verbesserungen im Vergleich mit vorhergehenden MODFLOW Versionen. Mit dem vorgeschlagenen CRR-Konzept (das weiterhin verbessert werden kann) hat die einfache MODFLOW 6-Umgebung eine Modellierungskapazität, die vergleichbar ist mit IHMs in multiplen Umgebungen, wobei es flexibler und effizienter ist. La modélisation hydrologique intégrée (IHM) constitue l’outil le plus adéquat pour étudier les interactions entre les eaux de surface et les eaux souterraines dans les systèmes hydrologiques complexes, tels que les systèmes de socle (HRS), en particulier ceux qui sont situés dans des environnements limités en eau (WLE). Ces conditions de systèmes de socle et de WLE sont représentées dans le bassin versant de Sardon ( 80 km^2) en Espagne, où l’algorithme MODFLOW 6 a été testé, en appliquant les améliorations suivantes par rapport aux travaux précédents sur ce bassin versant: nouveau modèle conceptuel, variables de forçages redéfinies par des données de télédétection, grille de Voronoï non structurée et, surtout, un nouveau concept de routage et de réinfiltration en cascade (CRR). Dans la version standard de MODFLOW 6, l’infiltration rejetée et l’exfiltration des eaux souterraines ont toujours été considérées comme des puits (évaporation). Cependant, en réalité, cette eau peut non seulement s’évaporer mais aussi réinfiltrer vers le compartiment souterrain ou se déplacer sous forme de ruissellement vers les masses d’eau de drainage. Le CRR améliore les interactions entre la surface et la zone non saturée, ainsi que les interactions entre la surface et les eaux souterraines. Les capacités standards et nouvelles de MODFLOW 6 sont présentées dans le modèle transitoire du bassin versant du Sardon, calibré à l’aide de 7 années d’hauteurs d’eau souterraine et de débits journaliers. Les résultats ont montré: la grande variabilité spatio-temporelle des flux d’eau souterraine, le rôle substantiel de l’exfiltration des eaux souterraines, le faible stockage du bassin versant, la réaction rapide de la nappe phréatique et des cours d’eau, et le caractère mosaïque de la recharge nette. Ces caractéristiques sont typiques des systèmes de socle en WLE avec une nappe phréatique peu profonde. MODFLOW 6 comporte de nombreuses améliorations par rapport aux versions précédentes de MODFLOW et, avec le concept de CRR proposé (qui peut encore être amélioré), MODFLOW 6 a une capacité de modélisation comparable aux IHM à environnements multiples, tout en étant plus flexible et plus efficace. Комплексное гидрологическое моделирование (integrated hydrological modelling, IHM) может надежно охарактеризовать взаимодействия поверхностных-вод/подземных вод в сложных гидрологических системах, таких как системы твердых пород (hard-rock systems, HRS), расположенные в средах с ограниченным количеством воды (water-limited environments, WLE).Такие условия HRS-WLE представлены водосбором Сардон ( 80 км2) в Испании, где была протестирована модель MODFLOW 6, в которой были применены следующие улучшения по сравнению с предыдущими работами в этом водосборе: новая концептуальная модель, движущие силы на основе данных дистанционного зондирования, неструктурированная сетка Вороного и, что наиболее важно, новая концепция каскадной маршрутизации и повторной инфильтрации (cascade-routing and reinfiltration, CRR).В стандартной MODFLOW 6 избыточная инфильтрация и эксфильтрация грунтовых вод всегда считались стоками (испарением).Однако на самом деле эта вода может не только испаряться, но и повторно инфильтроваться обратно в грунт или перемещаться в виде стока в дренажные водоемы.CRR улучшает взаимодействие поверхностных–ненасыщенных-зон, а также взаимодействие поверхностных-вод/подземных вод. Стандартная и новая производительность MODFLOW 6 представлена ​​в нестационарной модели водосбора Сардон, откалиброванной с использованием 7-летних суточных данных о напорах подземных вод и водотоков. Результаты показали большую пространственно-временную изменчивость потоков подземных вод, существенную роль эксфильтрации подземных вод, низкий уровень водосбора, быструю реакцию уровня грунтовых вод и водотоков и мозаичный характер чистого глубинного дренажа. Эти характеристики типичны для HRS-WLE с неглубоким уровнем грунтовых вод. MODFLOW 6 имеет много улучшений по сравнению с предыдущими версиями MODFLOW. Таким образом, с предложенной концепцией CRR (которая все еще может быть улучшена) однокомпонентная, модель MODFLOW 6 имеет возможности моделирования, сопоставимые с многокомпонентными IHMs, будучи более гибкой и более эффективной.},

  abstract  = {Rainfall is the main precursor of floods and landslide events that cause major damages every year worldwide. For an early warning system to be useful for risk mitigation and prompt interventions, the use of accurate rainfall forecasting models is crucial. With this aim, a blended model named PRAISE-MET (Prediction of Rainfall Amount Inside Storm Events with METeo) is proposed. The model is based on a coupling of a stochastic model and numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, and its characteristics are best for improving rainfall prediction at catchment scales, where the models generally used are often based on stochastic processing without using information from weather forecasts. PRAISE-MET can be easily adapted to provide input data in models for rainfall-runoff or landslide prediction, as shown for the case study illustrated here that occurred on 1 March 2006 in Montenero di Bisaccia (Central Italy). The application revealed how the use of the PRAISE-MET model would provide useful information on landslide triggering conditions in advance. The obtained results show that it is possible to gain some hours to effectively activate the protection procedures by setting the proper levels of exceedance probability for rainfall thresholds.},

  abstract  = {Horizontal connections in the primary visual cortex of carnivores, ungulates and primates organize on a near-regular lattice. Given the similar length scale for the regularity found in cortical orientation maps, the currently accepted theoretical standpoint is that these maps are underpinned by a like-to-like connectivity rule: horizontal axons connect preferentially to neurons with similar preferred orientation. However, there is reason to doubt the rule’s explanatory power, since a growing number of quantitative studies show that the like-to-like connectivity preference and bias mostly observed at short-range scale, are highly variable on a neuron-to-neuron level and depend on the origin of the presynaptic neuron. Despite the wide availability of published data, the accepted model of visual processing has never been revised. Here, we review three lines of independent evidence supporting a much-needed revision of the like-to-like connectivity rule, ranging from anatomy to population functional measures, computational models and to theoretical approaches. We advocate an alternative, distance-dependent connectivity rule that is consistent with new structural and functional evidence: from like-to-like bias at short horizontal distance to like-to-all at long horizontal distance. This generic rule accounts for the observed high heterogeneity in interactions between the orientation and retinotopic domains, that we argue is necessary to process non-trivial stimuli in a task-dependent manner.},

  abstract  = {Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) produces an array of localization coordinates by means of photoactivatable fluorescent proteins. However, observations are subject to fluorophore multiple blinking and each protein is included in the dataset an unknown number of times at different positions, due to localization error. This causes artificial clustering to be observed in the data. We present a ‘model-based correction’ (MBC) workflow using calibration-free estimation of blinking dynamics and model-based clustering to produce a corrected set of localization coordinates representing the true underlying fluorophore locations with enhanced localization precision, outperforming the state of the art. The corrected data can be reliably tested for spatial randomness or analyzed by other clustering approaches, and descriptors such as the absolute number of fluorophores per cluster are now quantifiable, which we validate with simulated data and experimental data with known ground truth. Using MBC, we confirm that the adapter protein, the linker for activation of T cells, is clustered at the T cell immunological synapse. A model-based correction (MBC) algorithm offers fast and accurate correction of multiple-blinking artifacts in PALM data. MBC outperforms other algorithms in both speed and accuracy and improves quantitative downstream image analysis.},

  abstract  = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining widespread adoption, which requires expanding the charging infrastructure. This infrastructure is part of a complex ecosystem that consists of multiple entities interacting with each other and exchanging (often personal) user data. Such a heterogeneous system with multiple participants exchanging personal data poses severe privacy risks to users. State-of-the-art literature insufficiently covers privacy aspects of charging ecosystem use cases. In this paper, a profound analysis of this ecosystem with respect to privacy is provided: First, the EV charging ecosystem and its entities are defined. Second, high-level use cases for EV charging identified in literature are analyzed and used for defining data flows within the charging ecosystem. Third, the identified use cases are compared in terms of privacy guarantees and adherence to standards. Fourth, representative implementations of these use cases are evaluated, i.e., all actors and (unintended) data flows are described and potential privacy threats are identified and visualized. It is found that privacy is not sufficiently covered by standards and implementations of EV charging use cases from literature. Furthermore, recommendations and future directions for protecting user privacy in the EV charging ecosystem are derived. In summary, stricter adherence to standards and privacy by design are suggested.},

  abstract  = {The Canary Islands are a leading tourist destination. Their strong economic dependence on this sector makes them vulnerable to climate change. The steep orography of the islands causes impact of climate change and their potential influence on tourism to be spatially heterogenous. To account for this variability, regional climate simulations were computed using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) numerical weather prediction model driven by the results of three CMIP5 global climate models as boundary conditions, using two different future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the projections. The simulations were performed at a spatial resolution of 3 km for three 30-year periods, recent past (1980–2009), mid-century (2030–2059), and end-century (2070–2099). For two widely used indices of tourist attractiveness (the Tourism Climate Index TCI and the Holiday Climate Index HCI), the coastal region of most islands currently has between 20 and 30 “excellent” and “ideal” days per month for tourism, with a decrease at higher elevations. Future leisure conditions are expected to improve at higher locations and during the autumn, winter and spring. In the RCP8.5 scenario, “excellent” days are projected to increase in winter at the end of the century. Nevertheless, in the southern areas, where most of the hotel infrastructure is located, the indices indicate significantly worsened conditions in summer, with only a few “excellent” days expected in some locations. Thermal comfort was identified as the most important factor determining the expected changes.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates international experiences and perspectives on how entrepreneurs can improve management practices while minimizing the COVID-19 pandemic’s social drama. The paper probes how companies deal with the myriad challenges they face amid the unfolding pandemic and how these processes’ economic and cultural dimensions may exert an enduring effect. A novel dataset analyses how entrepreneurs manage the change of management processes in a sample of ten countries. Three economic impacts on entrepreneurs caused by the pandemic were observed: (1) a deficit as a result of social distancing reduced due to the growth of Internet retailing; (2) a deficit resulting from a fall in demand decreased due to innovations that mitigate this demand-side change; (3) a social crisis in the labour market due to social distance and relocating many employees to remote working practices. In countries with the most considerable number of cases of COVID-19, it is recommended that attitudes towards entrepreneurial risk be raised. In countries with the vastest number of fatal cases per 100,000 people, implications for change management in entrepreneurship are an increase in Internet retailing level, a reduction in entrepreneurial fear of failure, and an increase in entrepreneurial risk awareness. Besides, an anonymous sociological survey among companies’ directors and managers in Russia on management initiatives taken on between late 2020–early 2021 shows that companies maintain a 60.21},

  abstract  = {Background Lake-terrestrial ecotone is a transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Linking land and lake, it is thus highly sensitive and vulnerable to disturbances. It includes three parts, namely, radiant belt toward land, shoreline zone and radiant belt toward lake. Extending from multi-year average low water level line to open water, radiant belt toward lake is a key part of lake-terrestrial ecotone. However, the delimitation method for radiant belt toward is unsolved, which is a big obstacle to protecting lake-terrestrial ecotone effectively. Wave is a major hydrodynamic factor in lakes, especially large shallow lakes. For linking landward and waterward directions, the boundary of radiant belt toward lake may be affected by waves. Hence, exampled as Lake Taihu, this research was carried out from wave perspective. Results In July 2021, a total of 12 species aquatic macrophyte were collected, including 3 species of floating-leaved and 9 submerged macrophyte within radiant belt toward lake of Lake Taihu. Aquatic macrophyte were incorporated into calibrated wave models driven by constant winds via MIKE21 SW. Wave height attenuation was successfully simulated, ranging − 0.19},

  abstract  = {In this paper, SBSC+SRU: an error-guided adaptive Kriging modeling method is proposed for the system reliability analysis with multiple failure modes. Therein, the accuracies of Kriging models will be improved by a novel learning function, in which the magnitude of Component Limit State Functions (CLSFs), uncertainties of Kriging models, and the coupling relationships among CLSFs are considered to identify the location and component index of the new sample. Then, the maximum estimated relative error of predicted failure probability is derivated by quantifying the probability of wrong sign prediction of samples. To be specific, the highly uncertain samples are first defined, after that the probability of wrong sign prediction of each highly uncertain sample is deduced combining the predictions of Kriging models and coupling relationship among all CLSFs. Therefore, the proposed approach knows the real-time estimated error and could terminate the adaptive updating process under the accuracy requirement. Three numerical examples including parallel and series system problems and an engineering case concerning the system reliability analysis of a stiffened cylindrical shell are studied to validate the performance of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the proposed method converges to the required estimated accuracy while saving considerable computational burdens compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

When a major event occurs, initial independent reactions may give way to more social diffusion of interpretations of the event among different communities, including those committed to disinformation. Here, we explore these dynamics through a case study analysis of the Russian-language Twitter content emerging from Belarus before and after its presidential election of August 9, 2020. From these Russian-language tweets, we extracted a set of topics that characterize the social media data and construct networks to represent the sharing of these topics before and after the election. The case study in Belarus reveals how misinformation can be re-invigorated in discourse through the novelty of a major event. More generally, it suggests how audience networks can shift from influentials dispensing information before an event to a de-centralized sharing of information after it.},

  abstract  = {Programming languages are complex systems that are usually implemented as monolithic interpreters and compilers. In recent years, researchers and practitioners gained interest in product line engineering to improve the reusability of language assets and the management of variability-rich systems, introducing the notions of language workbenches and language product lines (LPLs). Nonetheless, language development remains a complex activity and design or implementation flaws can easily waste the efforts of decomposing a language specification into language features. Poorly designed language decompositions result in high inter-dependent components, reducing the variability space of the LPL system and its maintainability. One should detect and fix the design flaws posthaste to prevent these risks while minimizing the development overhead. Therefore, various aspects of the quality of a language decomposition should be quantitatively measurable through adequate metrics. The evaluation, analysis and feedback of these measures should be a primary part of the engineering process of a LPL. In this paper, we present an exploratory study trying to capture these aspects by introducing a design methodology for LPLs; we define the properties of a good language decomposition and adapt a set of metrics from the literature to the framework of language workbenches. Moreover, we leverage the AiDE 2 LPL engineering environment to perform an empirical evaluation of 26 Neverlang -based LPLs based on this design methodology. Our contributions form the foundations of a design methodology for Neverlang -based LPLs. This methodology is comprised of four different elements: i) an engineering process that defines the order in which decisions are made, ii) an integrated development environment for LPL designers and iii) some best practices in the design of well-structured language decomposition when using Neverlang , supported by iv) a variety of LPL metrics that can be used to detect errors in design decisions.},

  abstract  = {The sudden outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the shortage of medical resources around the world, especially in developing countries and underdeveloped regions. With the continuous increase in the duration of this disease, the control of migration of humans between regions or countries has to be relaxed. Based on this, we propose a two-patches mathematical model to simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among two-patches, asymptomatic infected humans and symptomatic infected humans, where a half-saturated detection rate function is also introduced to describe the effect of medical resources. By applying the methods of linearization and constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, the local and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium of this model without migration is obtained. Further, the existence of forward/backward bifurcation is analyzed, which is caused by the limited medical resources. This means that the elimination or prevalence of the disease no longer depends on the basic reproduction number but is closely related to the initial state of asymptomatic and symptomatic infected humans and the supply of medical resources. Finally, the global dynamics of the full model are discussed, and some numerical simulations are carried to explain the main results and the effects of migration and supply of medical resources on the transmission of disease.},

We present a formal algebra FLASc for specifying and generating graph schema for labeled property graph databases. We formally define FLASc and demonstrate the use of FLASc generated graph schemas to systematically transform and load data-sets related to domains of cyber-physical systems, big data analytics and tourism. Findings from three disparate case studies show that FLASc -generated schemas assist in enforcing integrity constraints that reduce the chance of data corruption, hence assuring data consistency and integrity.},

In this paper, we present a functional infrastructure that allows modellers to define the structure and the operational semantics of multilevel modelling hierarchies, enabling simulation and analysis. Using the MultEcore tool, one can design and distribute the models that compose the language family in a multilevel hierarchy, and specify their behaviour by means of multilevel transformation, so-called multilevel coupled model transformations. We give a rewrite logic semantics to MultEcore’s MLM, on which we have based our automated transformation from MultEcore to the rewriting logic language Maude. Then, we rely on Maude to execute MultEcore models and to support analysis techniques, like reachability analysis, bounded and unbounded model checking of invariants and LTL formulas on systems with both finite and infinite reachable state spaces using equational abstraction. We illustrate our developed techniques on a DSML family for Petri nets.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, multi-level modeling has become more and more popular. It is mainly due to the fact that multi-level modeling aims to reduce or even totally eliminate any accidental complexity inadvertently created as by-product in traditional model design. Moreover, besides reducing model complexity, multi-level modeling also improves on general comprehension of models. The key enablers of multi-level modeling are the concepts of clabjects and deep instantiation. The latter is often governed by the potency notion, of which many different interpretations and variations emerged over the years. However, there exist also some approaches that disregard the potency notion. Thus, multi-level modeling approaches tend to take advantage of different theoretical and practical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework, the Multi-Level Modeling Playground (MLMP), which is a validating modeling environment for multi-level modeling research. The MLMP environment is based on our multi-layer modeling framework (the Dynamic Multi-Layer Algebra), which provides useful mechanisms to validate different multi-level modeling constructs. Since beyond the structure also the well-formedness rules of the modeling constructs can be specified, our proposed MLMP environment delivers several practical benefits: i) well-formedness is always verified, ii) multi-level constructs can be experimented with independently of any concrete tool chains, and iii) relationships (i.e., correlations or exclusions) between different multi-level constructs can be easily investigated in practice. Also, the capability of the environment is demonstrated via complete examples inspired by state-of-the-art research literature.},

  abstract  = {Tensor product model transformation could find a convex polytope representation similar to the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model from the given quasi-linear variable parameter (quasi-LPV) system model. TP models have proposed many convex hulls manipulated methods in previous studies, but these convex hulls are designed based on classical sampling methods, and local extrema refinement methods are often ignored by these classical sampling methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a convex hull manipulate method by adding local extremum to refine the partition of the entry functions, and the method is proposed based on vary input quasi-LPV state space models. First, the TP model transformation is extended by linearizing the weighting functions that is obtained via different ways of substituted entry functions, the given TS fuzzy model is converted into an alternative TS fuzzy model, and the converted TS fuzzy models are presented with different number of inputs. The difficulty level of controller design is reduced by changing the antecedents of the fuzzy sets, so the optimized control can be achieved via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Secondly, the local extrema refinement strategy is used to implement the TP model transformation, the manipulated method of convex hull is expanded. Finally, the GOOGOL’s two-wheeled self-balancing robot model is employed as the controlled object, and the tracking controller is attached for verification. At the same time, different external disturbances are considered to be added to the left and right wheels of the robot. The simulation results show that, by combining the state-space model with vary input variables and the local extrema refinement strategy, the designed controller achieved better control performance.},

  abstract  = {Cloud computing allows enterprises to incorporate applications and computational resources as services, and thus, enterprises can concentrate on their business processes, without concerning the development, configuration and maintenance of these applications and resources. Integration platforms are one of these services that allow enterprises to integrate applications in order to reduce the maintenance costs and operations of the integration of on-premises platforms. However, high performance on resources offered by the cloud, demands improvement in task scheduling of integration platforms. Our literature review has identified a lack of studies in the field of enterprise application integration, focusing on specificities and vulnerabilities of the task scheduling of integration processes. This is a pioneer work regarding the characterisation of the scheduling of tasks of integration processes. We propose a ranking according to their conceptual models and apply this ranking to five integration processes. Then, we have statistically analysed the influence of each component of their conceptual models on the performance of the execution of these integration processes. We characterise the task scheduling of integration processes and presented a mathematical equation for the makespan as a function of the components of this characterisation. This study can guide software engineers in the optimal task scheduling for integration processes, which can improve the performance runtime systems regarding using the computational resources and result in minimisation of costs of companies.},

This approach was devised to accelerate the computationally expensive geochemical reaction calculations in reactive transport simulations. We demonstrate that even with a strong heterogeneity present, the ODML algorithm speeds up these calculations by one to three orders of magnitude. Such acceleration, in turn, significantly advances the entire reactive transport simulation. The performed numerical experiments are enabled by the novel coupling of two open-source software packages : Reaktoro (Leal 2015 ) and Firedrake (Rathgeber et al. ACM Trans. Math.

However, conventional cycle-accurate DRAM subsystem models often become a bottleneck for the overall simulation speed. A promising alternative are simulators based on Transaction Level Modeling, which can be fast and accurate at the same time. In this paper we present DRAMSys4.0, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest and most extensive open-source cycle-accurate DRAM simulation framework. DRAMSys4.0 includes a novel software architecture that enables a fast adaption to different hardware controller implementations and new JEDEC standards. In addition, it already supports the latest standards DDR5 and LPDDR5. We explain how to apply optimization techniques for an increased simulation speed while maintaining full temporal accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the simulator’s accuracy and analysis tools with two application examples. Finally, we provide a detailed investigation and comparison of the most prominent cycle-accurate open-source DRAM simulators with regard to their supported features, analysis capabilities and simulation speed.},

  abstract  = {The sample distribution has a vital influence on the quality of a Kriging surrogate model, which may further influence the required cost or convergence of the surrogate model-based design and optimization problems. Adaptive sampling methods utilize the information from existing samples to reasonably allocate the sequential samples, which can generally build a more accurate Kriging surrogate model under the same computational budget. However, most of the existing adaptive sampling methods for the Kriging surrogate model are only available for single-output problems, and there are few studies on problems with multiple responses. In this paper, an adaptive sampling method based on Delaunay triangulation and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is proposed for Kriging surrogate model with multiple outputs (mKMDT). In the proposed mKMDT, Delaunay triangulation is used to partition the design space into multiple triangle regions, whose area denotes the dispersion of the sample points. The prediction error at each triangle’s centroid represents the local approximation error. Specifically, three different strategies are developed when allocating weights to the area and the prediction error of each triangle with the entropy method and the TOPSIS method. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical examples with different numbers of outputs and a collision problem between the missile and the adapter. Results show that the proposed method can construct an accuracy surrogate model with few samples, which is useful for practical engineering design problems with multiple outputs.},

WRF model at 25-km resolution was run in climate mode driven by boundary conditions from the Community Climate System Model version4 (CCSM4)—Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) outputs of the historical simulation. The model outputs were categorized for the four different seasons and validated through comparison with global analysis fields. Assessment of the model performance is done through comparison of the spatial distribution of temperature, pressure, geopotential, wind and rainfall. The simulation results show the distinct features of the atmospheric patterns corresponding to each of the four seasons. The reversal of the meridional temperature gradients over Indian subcontinent and north Indian Ocean between the winter and pre-monsoon seasons is accurately produced. All the distinct features of the winter and southwest monsoon and the transition seasons are well simulated. The simulated pre-monsoon heating and post-monsoon cooling over the land are in good agreement with the analysis. Simulation of the rainfall with the highest percentage of annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon season over central plains and during the post-monsoon season over the south peninsula authenticates the performance of the ARW (Advanced Research WRF) model in climate integrations. WRF model simulations of the 2-m temperature and rainfall on subregional scale for 30 subdivisions of the Indian subcontinent are found to be better than CCSM4. The WRF-generated regional climate data at 25 km for the Indian subcontinent agree with the analysis, which would be useful for agriculture and water resource management applications and as a reference data base for future climate studies.},

  abstract  = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly threatened global public health and produced social problems, which includes relative online collective actions. Based on the life cycle law, focusing on the life cycle process of COVID-19 online collective actions, we carried out both macro-level analysis (big data mining) and micro-level behaviors (Agent-Based Modeling) on pandemic-related online collective actions. We collected 138 related online events with macro-level big data characteristics, and used Agent-Based Modeling to capture micro-level individual behaviors of netizens. We set two kinds of movable agents, Hots (events) and Netizens (individuals), which behave smartly and autonomously. Based on multiple simulations and parametric traversal, we obtained the optimal parameter solution. Under the optimal solutions, we repeated simulations by ten times, and took the mean values as robust outcomes. Simulation outcomes well match the real big data of life cycle trends, and validity and robustness can be achieved. According to multiple criteria (spans, peaks, ratios, and distributions), the fitness between simulations and real big data has been substantially supported. Therefore, our Agent-Based Modeling well grasps the micro-level mechanisms of real-world individuals (netizens), based on which we can predict individual behaviors of netizens and big data trends of specific online events. Based on our model, it is feasible to model, calculate, and even predict evolutionary dynamics and life cycles trends of online collective actions.

Despite the already widespread use of the process, there is still a need for research to understand the mechanisms and design of clinched joints. In contrast to the tool parameters, process and material disturbances have not yet been investigated to a relatively large extent. However, these also have a great influence on the properties and applicability of clinching. The effect of process disturbances on the clinched joint are investigated with numerical and experimental methods. The investigated process variations are the history of the sheets using the pre-hardening of the material, different sheet thicknesses, sheet arrangements and punch strokes. For the consideration of the material history, a specimen geometry for pre-stretching specimens in uniaxial tension is used, from which the pre-stretched secondary specimens are taken. A finite element model is set up for the numerical investigations. Suitable clinching tools are selected. With the simulation, selected process influences can be examined. The effort of the numerical investigations is considerably reduced with the help of a statistical experimental design according to Taguchi. To confirm the simulation results, experimental investigations of the clinch point geometry by using micrographs and the shear strength of the clinched joint are performed. The analysis of the influence of difference disturbance factors on the clinching process demonstrate the importance of the holistic view of the clinching process.},

  abstract  = {A long simulation over the period 1901–2010 with an eddy-permitting ocean circulation model is used to study the variability of the upper layer circulation in the North Ionian Gyre (NIG) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMed). The model is driven by the atmospheric forcing from the twentieth century reanalysis data set ERA-20C, ensuring a consistent performance of the model over the entire simulation period. The main modes of variability known in the EMed, in particular the decadal reversals of the NIG upper layer circulation observed since the late 1980s are well reproduced. We find that the simulated NIG upper layer circulation prior to the observational period is characterized by long-lasting cyclonic phases with weak variability during years 1910–1940 and 1960–1985, while in the in-between period (1940–1960) quasi-decadal NIG circulation reversals occur with similar characteristics to those observed in the recent decades. Our simulation indicates that the NIG upper layer circulation is rather prone to the cyclonic mode with occasional kicks to the anticyclonic mode. The coherent variability of the NIG upper layer circulation mode and of the Adriatic Deep Water (AdDW) outflow implies that atmospheric forcing triggering strong AdDW formation is required to kick the NIG into an anticyclonic circulation 1–2 years later. A sensitivity experiment mimicking a cold winter event over the Adriatic Sea supports this hypothesis. Our simulation shows that it is the multi-decadal variability of the salinity in the Adriatic Sea that leads to periods where low salinity prevents strong AdDW formation events. This explains the absence of quasi-decadal NIG reversals during 1910–1940 and 1960–1985.},

  abstract  = {This study presents the improved future projections of the climate “warming—wetting” trend and climate extremes with different return periods in Northwest China at different global warming levels. The projections are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations constrained by the high-resolution observation dataset using the equidistant cumulative distribution functions (EDCDF) method. The results indicate that the climate will experience continuous warming and wetting as reflected by average temperature and total precipitation over Northwest China, especially under the scenario of the shared socioeconomic pathway 5—representative concentration pathway 8.5 (SSP5–8.5). Most parts of Northwest China will continue to warm in the future more than global average. Spatially, areas with prominent “warming—wetting” trends will be mainly distributed in western Northwest China. It is worth noting that extreme heat and precipitation events will also increase with the climate warming and wetting over Northwest China. Moreover, frequencies of rarer extreme events will increase more apparently than weaker extreme events and frequency increase of extreme heat events responds to global warming faster than that of extreme precipitation events. Limiting global warming within 2°C relative to 1850–1900 would slowdown the increase in extreme heat events and considerably suppress the increase in frequencies of extreme precipitation events, especially the rare (i.e., 50-yr) extreme events.},

The business cycle is exogenously set, and it can give rise to various scenarios. Compared to other models in this literature strand, we improve the mechanism according to which the dividends are distributed, including the possibility of stock repurchase by firms. In addition, we locate firms and banks over a space and firms may ask credit to many banks, resulting in a complex spatial network. The model reproduces a long list of stylized facts and their dynamic evolution as described by the cross-correlations among model variables. The model allows us to test the effectiveness of rules designed by the current financial regulation, such as the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer. We find that the effectiveness of this rule changes in different business cycle environments and this should be considered by policy makers.},

  abstract  = {The milk collection problem can be basically defined as the daily collection of raw milk from different points (farms/milk collection centers) and delivering it to a dairy facility. To enhance final dairy quality, it is important to use the appropriate quality of raw milk for each dairy product. However, collecting different types of milk comes with additional logistics costs which significantly increase in an uncertain environment. In this study, we, therefore, propose a novel mathematical model for the collection of different types of milk from producers by multi-tank tankers with split deliveries, uncertain demand, service time and vehicle speed conditions. A real-life case study from a dairy company is solved under different risk assessment scenarios. Indeed, several brand-new benchmark instances for the core problem are presented and solved by utilizing an efficient heuristics approach called enhanced iterative local search. All the case study results show that considering the uncertainty is very critical for designing efficient collection networks. The findings of the study indicate that logistics decision makers should design their collection networks with low, but non-zero, risk levels.},

  abstract  = {Reduced-order models (ROMs) become increasingly popular in industrial design and optimization processes, since they allow to approximate expensive high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in near real-time. The quality of ROM predictions highly depends on the placement samples in the spanned parameter space. Adaptive sampling strategies allow to identify regions of interest, which feature e.g. nonlinear responses with respect to the parameters, and therefore enable the sensible placement of new samples. By introducing more samples in these regions, the ROM prediction accuracy should increase. In this contribution we investigate different adaptive sampling strategies based on cross-validation, Gaussian mean-squared error, two methods exploiting the CFD residual and a two manifold embedding methods. The performance of those strategies is evaluated and measured by their ability to successfully identify the regions of interest and the resulting sample placement in terms of different quantitative statistical values. We further discuss the reduction of the ROM prediction error over the adaptive sampling iterations and show that depending on the adaptive sampling strategy, the number of required samples can be reduced by 35–44},

  abstract  = {Dryland droughts are prone to self-propagation due to the enhanced soil water stress, according to atmospheric moisture-tracking analysis of recent major droughts around the world. Reduced evaporation due to dry soils can affect the land surface energy balance, with implications for local and downwind precipitation. When evaporation is constrained by soil moisture, the atmospheric supply of water is depleted, and this deficit may propagate in time and space. This mechanism could theoretically result in the self-propagation of droughts, but the extent to which this process occurs is unknown. Here we isolate the influence of soil moisture drought on downwind precipitation using Lagrangian moisture tracking constrained by observations from the 40 largest recent droughts worldwide. We show that dryland droughts are particularly prone to self-propagating because evaporation tends to respond strongly to enhanced soil water stress. In drylands, precipitation can decline by more than 15},

The proposed methodology enables reducing the time application components rely on faulted services, hence residing in “unstable” states where they can suddenly fail in cascade or exhibit erroneous behaviour.

  abstract  = {Gamification refers to the attempt to transform different kinds of systems to be able to better invoke positive experiences such as the flow state. However, the ability of such intervention to invoke flow state is commonly believed to depend on several moderating factors including the user’s traits. Currently, there is a dearth of research on the effect of user traits on the results of gamification. Gamer types (personality traits related to gaming styles and preferences) are considered some of the most relevant factors affecting the individual’s susceptibility to gamification. Therefore, in this study we investigate how gamer types from the BrainHex taxonomy (achiever, conqueror, daredevil, mastermind, seeker, socializer and survivor) moderate the effects of personalized/non-personalized gamification on users’ flow experience (challenge-skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, feedback, concentration, control, loss of self-consciousness and autotelic experience), enjoyment, perception of gamification and motivation. We conducted a mixed factorial within-subject experiment involving 121 elementary school students comparing a personalized version against a non-personalized version of a gamified education system. There were no main effects between personalization and students’ flow experience, perception of gamification and motivation, and enjoyment. Our results also indicate patterns of characteristics that can lead students to the high flow experience (e.g., those who prefer to play multiplayer have a high flow experience in both personalized and non-personalized versions). Based on our results, we provided recommendations to advance the design of gamifed educational systems.},

The contributions of a developer could be in many different forms such as committing and reviewing code, opening and resolving issues. Previous approaches mainly consider the commit-based contributions which provide an incomplete picture of developer contributions. Objective Different from the traditional commit-based approaches for analyzing developer contributions, we aim to provide a more holistic approach to reflect the rich set of software development activities using artifact traceability graphs. Method For analyzing the developer contributions, we propose a novel categorization of developers (Jacks, Mavens and Connectors) in a software project.

  abstract  = {Animal migration contributes largely to the seasonal dynamics of High Arctic ecosystems, linking distant habitats and impacting ecosystem structure and function. In polar deserts, Arctic hares are abundant herbivores and important components of food webs. Their annual migrations have long been suspected, but never confirmed. We tracked 25 individuals with Argos satellite telemetry to investigate the existence of migration in a population living at Alert (Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada). During fall, 21 hares undertook directional, long-distance movements in a southwestern direction towards Lake Hazen. Daily movement rates averaged 1.3 ± 0.5 km, 4.3 ± 1.6 km, and 1.7 ± 0.9 km before, during, and after relocation, respectively. Straight-line and minimum cumulative distances traveled averaged 98 ± 18 km (range: 72–148 km) and 198 ± 62 km (range: 113–388 km), respectively. This is the first report of large-scale seasonal movements in Arctic hares and, surprisingly, in any lagomorph species. These movements may be part of an annual migratory pattern. Our results redefine our understanding of the spatial ecology of Arctic hares, demonstrate unsuspected mobility capacities in lagomorphs, and open new perspectives regarding the ecological dynamics of the northern polar deserts.},

Interactive musculoskeletal models (IMMs) can be controlled by muscle activity recorded with electromyography (EMG). IMMs are typically coded using textual programming languages that present barriers to understanding for non-experts. The goal of this project was to use a visual programming language (Simulink) to create and test an IMM that is accessible to non-specialists for research and educational purposes. Results The developed IMM allows users to practice a goal-directed task with different control modes (keyboard, mouse, and EMG) and actuator types (muscle model, force generator, and torque generator). Example data were collected using both keyboard and EMG control. One male participant in his early 40’s performed a goal-directed task for four sequential trials using each control mode. For EMG control, the participant used a low-cost EMG system with consumer-grade EMG sensors and an Arduino microprocessor. The participant successfully performed the task with both control modes, but the inability to grade muscle model excitation and co-activate antagonist muscles limited performance with keyboard control. The IMM developed for this project serves as a foundation that can be further tailored to specific research and education needs.},

  abstract  = {Electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools have become indispensable in the design of contemporary antennas. Still, the major setback of EM-driven design is the associated computational overhead. This is because a single full-wave simulation may take from dozens of seconds up to several hours, thus, the cost of solving design tasks that involve multiple EM analyses may turn unmanageable. This is where faster system representations (surrogates) come into play. Replacing expensive EM-based evaluations by cheap yet accurate metamodels seems to be an attractive solution. Still, in antenna design, application of surrogate models is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. A practical workaround has been offered by the recently reported reference-design-free constrained modeling techniques that restrict the metamodel domain to the parameter space region encompassing high-quality designs. Therein, the domain is established using only a handful of EM-simulations. This paper proposes a novel modeling technique, which incorporates the response feature technology into the constrained modeling framework. Our methodology allows for rendering accurate surrogates using exceptionally small training data sets, at the expense of reducing the generality of the modeling procedure to antennas that exhibit consistent shape of input characteristics. The proposed technique can be employed in other fields that employ costly simulation models (e.g., mechanical or aerospace engineering).},

  abstract  = {Structural reliability analysis of redundant systems in engineering practice is a demanding task. Besides the computational cost associated with performance function evaluations, it involves the identification and combination of lots failure modes and consideration of statistical dependencies among them, which can be computationally demanding. In this paper, an approach for the estimation of failure probabilities of redundant structural systems, which makes use of the global structural response and of Kriging surrogate models instead of fault tree analyses, is proposed. The global response is obtained from a mechanical model that adequately represents the sequence of events leading to a failure in a given scenario. By combining this model with Monte Carlo simulation, the statistical dependencies among events and among failure modes may be directly addressed. To reduce the number of required mechanical model evaluations, the performance function is replaced herein by an adaptive Kriging surrogate model. Moreover, in addition to the estimation of the probability of failure, the dominant failure modes can be identified along the adaptive process of the surrogate model.

  abstract  = {Nowadays, autonomous robots are increasingly accomplishing tasks in the dynamic world where environment states may change unexpectedly and be partially observable. The robot tasks in dynamic environments generally expect the robot to continuously deliberate upon the task goal while effectively obtaining environmental information with sensor and actuator actions. Implementing the underlying robotic software for such tasks can be rather difficult and tedious. The software developers need to synthetically implement the decision-making issues of controlling and planning, as well as the interactions between robotic sensing and actuating components, which is much more challenging than general-purpose software development. The existing software engineering practices focus on the general-purpose software development issues of modularity and communication, without specialized architectural solutions for the implementation of robotic controlling and decision-making processes, which still limits the implementation efficiency of robotic software in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a general-purpose scheme of adjoint observation between robotic sensing and actuating components, which specifies the integral control loop of controlling, planning, and data flows. The adjoint observation scheme solves the problem of effectively exploring the environment for effective observations by the integral control loop. Then we utilize the Behavior Tree component software architecture for concrete implementation of adjoint observation schemes. More specifically, we propose the Parallel and Fallback tree structure for concrete implementation of adjoint control flows. We also extend the BT architecture with an online planning component and mutual data store mechanism, enabling continuous planning and efficient data communication between robotic sensing and actuating processes. In the experiment, we select the Classical BT approach and Pure ROS-based approach as baseline approaches, to validate the task effectiveness of the adjoint observation scheme and development efficiency of the supporting software architecture.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, the methods retrieving tide and SWH using reflected BeiDou GEO satellite signals are proposed, and a data-driven method is proposed to calibrate sea state bias of the retrieved tide. In addition, an estimator combining multi-satellite observation based on linear unbiased minimum variance (LUMV) is developed to improve the retrieved precision. The B1I signal experiments in Qingdao and Shenzhen show after calibrating sea state influence using the proposed method, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) could fall to 0.40 m from 0.45 m, and compared to the single-satellite observation, the multi-satellite observation based on the LUMV estimator could significantly reduce the RMSE of the retrieved tide to 0.16 m. Shenzhen experiment is also used to evaluate the performance of retrieving SWH and the determination coefficient of 0.60 is obtained. This paper also conducts Monte Carlo simulation and experiment to evaluate the altimetry and measuring SWH precision using reflected B3I signal. The simulated results when SNR is over 5 dB, incoherent averaging number is 10000, and the receiver bandwidth is over 45 MHz, the estimated precision of the delay can reach up 
$$\sim $$
 ∼ 0.15 m, and the precision of the normalized area ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 m. The B3I experiment show that compared to B1I signal, when the reflected signal from individual satellite is used, the better precision with the RMSE of 0.25 can be obtained, and when combining the measurements from the three satellites using LUMV estimator, the RMSE reduces to 0.16 m. Further, the precision of 0.12 m can be obtained by calibrating the sea state influence.},

Besides assessing the baseline performance of the production process, impact of key design and operational uncertainties on the productivity and cost performance of these vaccine platforms is quantified using variance-based global sensitivity analysis. Cost and resource requirement projections are computed for manufacturing multi-billion vaccine doses for covering the current global demand shortage and for providing annual booster immunisations.

  abstract  = {Software traceability, the ability to relate software development artifacts such as requirements, design models and code to each other, is an important aspect in software development. It yields a number of benefits such as facilitating impact analysis and tracking software changes. However, for companies to reap these benefits, a proper traceability strategy—a plan for how traceability should be managed—needs to be defined and implemented. Existing literature lacks concrete guidelines for practitioners to systematically define such a strategy. In this study, we address this gap by defining a Traceability Introduction Methodology (TracIMo), which is a methodology for systematically designing, implementing and evaluating software traceability in practice. We used design science research to design TracIMo and evaluated it in a case study with an agile development team of a company in the finance domain. Our results show that TracIMo is feasible as it allows incremental definition and evaluation of a traceability strategy that is aligned with the company’s traceability goals and the existing development process. We also report practical challenges encountered when designing a traceability strategy such as defining the right level of granularity and the need for defining intermediate development artifacts.},

  abstract  = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly used in the management sciences. Though useful, ABMs are often critiqued: it is hard to discern why they produce the results they do and whether other assumptions would yield similar results. To help researchers address such critiques, we propose a systematic approach to conducting sensitivity analyses of ABMs. Our approach deals with a feature that can complicate sensitivity analyses: most ABMs include important non-parametric elements, while most sensitivity analysis methods are designed for parametric elements only. The approach moves from charting out the elements of an ABM through identifying the goal of the sensitivity analysis to specifying a method for the analysis. We focus on four common goals of sensitivity analysis: determining whether results are robust, which elements have the greatest impact on outcomes, how elements interact to shape outcomes, and which direction outcomes move when elements change. For the first three goals, we suggest a combination of randomized finite change indices calculation through a factorial design. For direction of change, we propose a modification of individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots to account for the stochastic nature of the ABM response. We illustrate our approach using the Garbage Can Model, a classic ABM that examines how organizations make decisions.},

Based on the climatic scenario data of CMIP6 SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 released by IPCC in 2020, which combines shared socioeconomic paths (SSPs) with typical concentration paths (RCPs), observation climatic data concerning meteorological stations, the population, GDP, transportation data, land-cover data from 2020, and related policy refences, are used to simulate scenarios of land-cover change in the Jing-Jin-Ji region using SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 for the years 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively.

  abstract  = {Two regional climate simulation experiments (spectral nudging and re-initialization) at convection-permitting scale are conducted using the WRF model driven by the 4th generation Global Reanalysis data (ERA5) from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The surface air temperature (T2m) and the precipitation in summer during 2016–2018 are evaluated against the in-situ station observations and the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) dataset. The results show that both experiments as well as ERA5 can successfully capture the spatial distribution and the daily variation of T2m and precipitation, with reasonable cold bias for temperature and dry bias for precipitation when compared with the station observations. In addition, the diurnal cycle of precipitation is investigated, indicating that both experiments tend to simulate the afternoon precipitation peak in advance and postpone the night precipitation peak. The precipitation bias is reduced by using the spectral nudging technique, especially at night and early morning. Both WRF experiments outperform ERA5 in reproducing the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount. Possible causes for the differences between the two experiments are also analyzed. In the re-initialization experiment, the daytime net shortwave radiation contributes a lot to the cold biases of Tmax, and the stronger vertically integrated moisture flux convergence leads to more precipitation compared with the spectral nudging experiment over the central and southeastern TP. These results can provide valuable guidance for further fine-scale simulation studies over the TP.},

However, the deployment of SOA into an enterprise is a challenging task, as it may involve the modernization of mission-critical systems with high technical debt and high maintenance costs. To this end, a process is required to provide an appropriate set of steps and techniques that minimize risks and at the same time ensure the quality of the systems during the migration process. Thus, this work presents the Service-oriented Process for Reengineering and DevOps—SPReaD, an instantiation of the mainstream SOA methodology focusing on the reengineering of legacy systems integrating DevOps aspects for developing microservices systems. This process has been defined during a real software reengineering project of legacy systems from a Brazilian State Department of Taxation.

We have developed an OLE (called APLUS) on which students can interactively teach a TA (called SimStudent) how to solve problems. APLUS has a cognitive tutor embedded (aka meta-tutor) that provides students with adaptive feedback and help on how to solve problems. The results showed that the expert model created by SimStudent was highly accurate with more than 0.95 precision and recall scores on two different task domains (equation solving and fraction addition). The cost analysis showed that although the authors need to provide SimStudent with task dependent Java code, the amount of code written was relatively small—about 1000–2000 lines of code in 20 to 50 classes. Those findings imply that the TA has practical potential to help authors of APLUS create a domain expert model for the embedded cognitive tutor and the tutoring interface used for the OLE. It was also observed that the failure of TA to learn expected cognitive skills helps the author identify missing essential cognitive factors that must be encoded in the OLE.},

Thus, it would be very desirable to overcome the challenge of stick-slip vibration via an effective control strategy. This paper proposes a new robust active controller based on the fuzzy sliding mode approach to suppress stick-slip vibration and to maintain the angular velocity of the drill components at the desired references. A discontinuous lumped parameter torsional model of a vertical drill string based on four degrees of freedom is used in this study. In addition to the drill bit and rotary table, the drill pipes and drill collars are included in the model. Moreover, nonlinear interactions between the drill bit and the rocks, including friction torque and the mud drilling effect, are considered. The proposed hybrid controller is based on a combination of artificial intelligence and a discontinuous first-order sliding mode control approach. A comprehensive numerical analysis was conducted by means of MATLAB and Simulink software. Real-time implementation of the system was conducted using dSPACE control board. The proposed controller has been tested under severe weight on bit variation and at different angular velocities. The results of the simulation and the real-time implementation are presented to demonstrate the good performance and feasibility of the proposed controller.},

The kinematics of a robot refers to the motion analysis, such as coordinates, velocity, and acceleration. However, current researches always focus on the holonomic full-actuated robot. This paper is devoted to a kind of novel NSUR and its theoretical kinematics analysis model. After NSUR was introduced, the kinematic representation of NSUR was discussed. A pair inverse and forward kinematics analysis of NSUR was put forward in detail. The kinematic analysis of joint of underactuated robot, as the application of NSUR, is applied to explain and verify this methodology.

  abstract  = {To overcome a shortage of flexible and low-cost solutions for wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) preprocessing, this work’s objective was to develop and validate an in-house computational programme in an open-source environment for WAAM preprocessing planning. Algorithms for reading STL (stereolithography) files and implementing rotation, slicing, trajectory planning, and machine code generation were elaborated and implemented in the Scilab environment (free and open-source). A graphical interface was developed to facilitate user interaction, with 5 options for path planning. The functionality of each work step is detailed. For validation of the software, single and multiple-layer prints, with different geometrical complexity and printing challenges, were built in a CNC table geared by the generated machine code. The validation criteria were deposition imperfection, morphological, and dimensional tolerances. The outputs showed that the parts were successfully printed. Therefore, this work demonstrates that Scilab provides the necessary resources for companies and universities to implement and/or develop algorithms for planning and generating trajectories for WAAM. Moreover, emerging ideas can be reasonably easily implemented in such software, not always possible in commercial packages.},

  abstract  = {Human behavior and interaction in road traffic is highly complex, with many open scientific questions of high applied importance, not least in relation to recent development efforts toward automated vehicles. In parallel, recent decades have seen major advances in cognitive neuroscience models of human decision-making, but these models have mainly been applied to simplified laboratory tasks. Here, we demonstrate how variable-drift extensions of drift diffusion (or evidence accumulation) models of decision-making can be adapted to the mundane yet non-trivial scenario of a pedestrian deciding if and when to cross a road with oncoming vehicle traffic. Our variable-drift diffusion models provide a mechanistic account of pedestrian road-crossing decisions, and how these are impacted by a variety of sensory cues: time and distance gaps in oncoming vehicle traffic, vehicle deceleration implicitly signaling intent to yield, as well as explicit communication of such yielding intentions. We conclude that variable-drift diffusion models not only hold great promise as mechanistic models of complex real-world decisions, but that they can also serve as applied tools for improving road traffic safety and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Recent research shows that flexoelectricity may prominently affect the electromechanical coupling responses of elastic dielectrics at the nanoscale. From the perspective of devices design, it is urgent to know how the input parameters affect the electromechanical coupling behaviors of flexoelectric nanostructures. In this work, global sensitivity analysis is applied to elastic dielectric nanoplates to decompose the attribution of each of the parameters. Meanwhile, the existing hierarchical regression is found not suitable for simultaneously evaluating the multicollinearity and high dimensionality problems, when global sensitivity analysis of flexoelectric nanostructures is obtained combining polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). In order to overcome the above issues, the following strategies is proposed: 1) First, an adaptive sparse scheme is employed to build the sparse PCE. The number of terms of the PCE is decreased through choosing the most related polynomials with respect to a given model output. 2) Then, the hierarchical regression can be carried out iteratively via combining with the adaptive-sparse scheme. 3) Finally, the Sobol sensitivity indices are calculated through using these procedures. Further, Sobol sensitivity indices reveal that the thickness is the decisive input parameter that strongly affects the buckling and vibration responses of the flexoelectric nanoplate; the flexoelectric coefficients is the next key parameter that affect the buckling and vibration responses of flexoelectric nanoplate. Our finding also demonstrates that the influence of the flexoelectric coefficient is much stronger than that of the piezoelectric coefficient, which revealed the domination of the flexoelectric effect in ultra-thin piezoelectric nanostructures.},

  abstract  = {A multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method based on intuitionistic fuzzy preference information is proposed for the multi-attribute intuitionistic fuzzy group decision-making problem where the decision-makers weight and attribute weight are completely unknown and the decision-maker has preference information for the scheme. Firstly, an intuitionistic fuzzy interval judgment matrix is established to describe the original data of the key decision indicators for multiple network public opinion emergencies that erupt simultaneously. Secondly, the attribute weights are determined based on the improved intuitionistic fuzzy entropy construction method, and the expert weights are determined by using objective decision information, taking into account the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy of decision matrix. MAGDM can not only synthesize experts' professional experience in different aspects, but also avoid experts' decision-making errors caused by insufficient domain knowledge. It is necessary to continuously adjust the expert weight based on decision-making information to make the comprehensive decision-making information more accurate. Thirdly, a scheme preference model and an attribute weight optimization model are established to determine the ranking method of intuitionistic fuzzy interval values. Then, a modified distance measure of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is introduced to make the evaluation result more accurate and reasonable when it comes to solving the deviation between the evaluation value and ideal solution of each scheme. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed decision-making method are verified by an example of emergency crisis severity, It assists decision makers in selecting and implementing the optimal emergency response plan in a timely and efficient manner, which improves the emergency treatment efficiency of network public opinion crisis, helps emergency departments to better deal with the network public opinion crisis, improves the ability of public opinion guidance and control, and provides a new method and idea for multi-attribute intuitionistic fuzzy group decision-making problem.},

  abstract  = {Background The ability to measure joint kinematics in natural environments over long durations using inertial measurement units (IMUs) could enable at-home monitoring and personalized treatment of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders. However, drift, or the accumulation of error over time, inhibits the accurate measurement of movement over long durations. We sought to develop an open-source workflow to estimate lower extremity joint kinematics from IMU data that was accurate and capable of assessing and mitigating drift. Methods We computed IMU-based estimates of kinematics using sensor fusion and an inverse kinematics approach with a constrained biomechanical model. We measured kinematics for 11 subjects as they performed two 10-min trials: walking and a repeated sequence of varied lower-extremity movements. To validate the approach, we compared the joint angles computed with IMU orientations to the joint angles computed from optical motion capture using root mean square (RMS) difference and Pearson correlations, and estimated drift using a linear regression on each subject’s RMS differences over time. Results IMU-based kinematic estimates agreed with optical motion capture; median RMS differences over all subjects and all minutes were between 3 and 6 degrees for all joint angles except hip rotation and correlation coefficients were moderate to strong (r = 0.60–0.87). We observed minimal drift in the RMS differences over 10 min; the average slopes of the linear fits to these data were near zero (− 0.14–0.17 deg/min). Conclusions Our workflow produced joint kinematics consistent with those estimated by optical motion capture, and could mitigate kinematic drift even in the trials of continuous walking without rest, which may obviate the need for explicit sensor recalibration (e.g. sitting or standing still for a few seconds or zero-velocity updates) used in current drift-mitigation approaches when studying similar activities. This could enable long-duration measurements, bringing the field one step closer to estimating kinematics in natural environments.},

In this paper, the criticality fuzzy safety importance measure of the multicomponent system under fuzzy inputs is first defined to measure the contribution of each component to the system failure. The defined criticality fuzzy safety importance measure can be applied to fault diagnosis, i.e., when a system fails, the component with the largest importance is the most probable component causing failure, thus should be checked first. Then, a method combining the multivariate Gaussian process and fuzzy simulation is proposed to estimate the criticality fuzzy safety importance measure and rank the importance of components by taking the correlation of components into consideration. Finally, several examples are employed to analyze the component importance as well as to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Smart decision making plays a central role for smart city governance. It exploits data analytics approaches applied to collected data, for supporting smart cities stakeholders in understanding and effectively managing a smart city. Smart governance is performed through the management of key performance indicators (KPIs), reflecting the degree of smartness and sustainability of smart cities. Even though KPIs are gaining relevance, e.g., at European level, the existing tools for their calculation are still limited. They mainly consist in dashboards and online spreadsheets that are rigid, thus making the KPIs evolution and customization a tedious and error-prone process. In this paper, we exploit model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques, through metamodel-based domain-specific languages (DSLs), to build a framework called MIKADO  for the automatic assessment of KPIs over smart cities. In particular, the approach provides support for both: ( i ) domain experts, by the definition of a textual DSL for an intuitive KPIs modeling process and ( ii ) smart cities stakeholders, by the definition of graphical editors for smart cities modeling. Moreover, dynamic dashboards are generated to support an intuitive visualization and interpretation of the KPIs assessed by our KPIs evaluation engine. We provide evaluation results by showing a demonstration case as well as studying the scalability of the KPIs evaluation engine and the general usability of the approach with encouraging results. Moreover, the approach is open and extensible to further manage comparison among smart cities, simulations, and KPIs interrelations.},

  abstract  = {Enterprise architecture has become an important driver to facilitate digital transformation in companies, since it allows to manage IT and business in a holistic and integrated manner by establishing connections among technology concerns and strategical/motivational ones. Enterprise architecture modelling is critical to accurately represent business and their IT assets in combination. This modelling is important when companies start to manage their enterprise architecture, but also when it is remodelled so that the enterprise architecture is realigned in a changing world. Enterprise architecture is commonly modelled by few experts in a manual way, which is error-prone and time-consuming and makes continuous realignment difficult. In contrast, other enterprise architecture modelling proposal automatically analyses some artefacts like source code, databases, services, etc. Previous automated modelling proposals focus on the analysis of individual artefacts with isolated transformations toward ArchiMate or other enterprise architecture notations and/or frameworks. We propose the usage of Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) to represent all the intermediate information retrieved from information systems’ artefacts, which is then transformed into ArchiMate models. Thus, the core contribution of this paper is the model transformation between KDM and ArchiMate metamodels. The main implication of this proposal is that ArchiMate models are automatically generated from a common knowledge repository. Thereby, the relationships between different-nature artefacts can be exploited to get more complete and accurate enterprise architecture representations.},

  abstract  = {As model-driven engineering (MDE) is increasingly adopted in complex industrial scenarios, modeling artefacts become a key and strategic asset for companies. As such, any MDE ecosystem must provide mechanisms to protect and exploit them. Current approaches depend on the calculation of the relative similarity among pairs of models. Unfortunately, model similarity calculation mechanisms are computationally expensive which prevents their use in large repositories or very large models. In this sense, this paper explores the adaptation of the robust hashing technique to the MDE domain as an efficient estimation method for model similarity. Indeed, robust hashing algorithms (i.e., hashing algorithms that generate similar outputs from similar input data) have proved useful as a key building block in intellectual property protection, authenticity assessment and fast comparison and retrieval solutions for different application domains. We present a detailed method for the generation of robust hashes for different types of models. Our approach is based on the translation to the MDE domain of diverse techniques such as summary extraction, minhash generation and locality-sensitive hash function families, originally developed for the comparison and classification of large datasets. We validate our approach with a prototype implementation and show that: (1) our approach can deal with any graph-based model representation; (2) a strong correlation exists between the similarity calculated directly on the robust hashes and a distance metric calculated over the original models; and (3) our approach scales well on large models and greatly reduces the time required to find similar models in large repositories.},

  abstract  = {The emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in different and complex applications has made their focus on numerous research areas. A prominent effort focused on reconfiguration approaches that present a significant concern in sensor networks. A WSN system must be capable of modifying its behavior according to its requirements or the environment changes in ways that increase network longevity. This has prompted the development of several software solutions and mechanisms that can enable the design and development of self-adaptive WSN. However, there is still a lack of support in expressing high-level techniques which provide more abstract and reusable designs. In this sense, this paper presents a new solution for the design and development of a reconfigurable WSN system based on model driven engineering (MDE) paradigm called EARN (Energy Aware Reconfigurable Node)-MDE solution. The proposed process offers a complete methodology for the development of reconfigurable WSN from the modeling step to the final code generation. The EARN-MDE process is based on design patterns and MDE concepts. It permits the automatic generation of a high-level reconfigurable WSN model, specifically network level based reconfiguration. It offers also Model-To-Text transformations for automatically generating codes that enable the system description and analysis phase. Finally, the EARN-MDE process is tested and validated through the EARNPIPE demonstrator located at the Digital Research Center of Sfax},

  abstract  = {A product line is an approach for systematically managing configuration options of customizable systems, usually by means of features. Products are generated for configurations consisting of selected features. Product-line evolution can lead to unintended changes to product behavior. We illustrate that updating configurations after product-line evolution requires decisions of both, domain engineers responsible for product-line evolution as well as application engineers responsible for configurations. The challenge is that domain and application engineers might not be able to interact with each other. We propose a formal foundation and a methodology that enables domain engineers to guide application engineers through configuration evolution by sharing knowledge on product-line evolution and by defining automatic update operations for configurations. As an effect, we enable knowledge transfer between those engineers without the need for interactions. We evaluate our methodology on four large-scale industrial product lines. The results of the qualitative evaluation indicate that our method is flexible enough for real-world product-line evolution. The quantitative evaluation indicates that we detect product behavior changes for up to 
$$55.3\%$$

  abstract  = {With the widespread use of agile software development methods, such as agile and scrum, software is iteratively updated more frequently. To ensure the quality of the software, regression testing is conducted before new versions are released. Moreover, to improve the efficiency of regression testing, testing efforts should be concentrated on the modified and impacted parts of a program. However, the costs of manually constructing new test cases for the modified and impacted parts are relatively expensive. Fuzz testing is an effective method for generating test data automatically, but it is usually devoted to achieving higher code coverage, which makes fuzz testing unsuitable for direct regression testing scenarios. For this reason, we propose a fuzz testing method based on the guidance of historical version information. First, the differences between the program being tested and the last version are analyzed, and the results of the analysis are used to locate change points. Second, change impact analysis is performed to find the corresponding impacted basic blocks. Finally, the fitness values of test cases are calculated according to the execution traces, and new test cases are generated iteratively by the genetic algorithm. Based on the proposed method, we implement a prototype tool DeltaFuzz and conduct experiments on six open-source projects. Compared with the fuzzing tool AFLGo, AFLFast and AFL, DeltaFuzz can reach the target faster, and the time taken by DeltaFuzz was reduced by 20.59},

  abstract  = {The problem of locating a contour widely exists in the engineering product design, such as the constrained optimization problem, reliability analysis, and so on. The surrogate model-assisted contour prediction methods have gained more attention lately because they can alleviate the computational burden significantly compared with the traditional simulation-based approaches. Representatively, the method built on the expected improvement (EI) infill criterion can allocate a contour from expensive simulations by refining the Kriging model with high-fidelity (HF) samples sequentially. Recently, the multi-fidelity (MF) Kriging model has gained remarkable attention because it integrates the accurate but costly HF model and cheap but biased low-fidelity (LF) model to provide an accurate prediction of the original black-box system. To facilitate the usage of the MF Kriging model in the contour prediction, a novel sequential multi-fidelity surrogate model-assisted contour prediction method is developed in this work. First, an extended expected improvement (EEI) infill criterion is developed to overcome the shortcoming of the original EI criterion on determining the locations and fidelity level of new samples. The developed EEI criterion can quantify the improvement of a sample from different fidelities over the contour of interest by considering the relative correlation between different fidelities. Second, considering the significant effect of the high-to-low simulation cost ratio on the MF Kriging model, the proposed approach selects an HF sample or several LF samples with equivalent computational resources to refine the MF Kriging model in each cycle according to their total improvements to the contour of interest. To this end, the EEI criterion is further revised combining a parallel strategy to generate the LF samples. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on three numerical examples with different complexities and an engineering case. The results show that the proposed approach has better efficiency, prediction accuracy, and robust performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Automated verification of distributed systems becomes very important in distributed computing. The graphical insight into the system in the early and late stages of the project is essential. In the design phase, the visual input helps to articulate the collaborative distributed components clearly. The formal verification gives evidence of correctness or malfunction, but in the latter case, graphical simulation of counterexample helps for better understanding design errors. For these purposes, we invented Distributed Autonomous and Asynchronous Automata (DA^3), which have the same semantics as the formal verification base—Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS). The IMDS model reflects the natural characteristics of distributed systems: unicasting, locality, autonomy, and asynchrony. Distributed automata have all of these features because they share the same semantics as IMDS. In formalism, the unified system definition has two views: the server view of the cooperating distributed nodes and the agent view of the migrating agents performing distributed computations. The automata have two formally equivalent forms that reflect two views: Server DA^3 for observing servers exchanging messages, and Agent DA^3 for tracking agents, which visit individual servers in their progress of distributed calculations. We present the DA^3 formulation based on the IMDS formalism and their application to design and verify distributed systems in the Dedan environment. DA^3 formalism is compared with other concepts of distributed automata known from the literature.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the regional impact of future climate change is one of the major global challenges of this century. This study investigated possible effects of climate change on malaria in West Africa in the near future (2006–2035) and the far future (2036–2065) under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), compared to an observed evaluation period (1981–2010). Projected rainfall and temperature were obtained from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) simulations of the Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric regional climate model (RCA4). The malaria model used is the Liverpool malaria model (LMM), a dynamical malaria model driven by daily time series of rainfall and temperature obtained from the CORDEX data. Our results highlight the unimodal shape of the malaria prevalence distribution, and the seasonal malaria transmission contrast is closely linked to the latitudinal variation of the rainfall. Projections showed that the mean annual malaria prevalence would decrease in both climatological periods under both RCPs but with a larger magnitude of decreasing under the RCP8.5. We found that the mean malaria prevalence for the reference period is greater than the projected prevalence for 6 of the 8 downscaled GCMs. The study enhances understanding of how malaria is impacted under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. These results indicate that the southern area of West Africa is at most risk of epidemics, and the malaria control programs need extra effort and help to make the best use of available resources by stakeholders.},

The three-dimensional discrete element model of cement mixture was established by using these microscopic parameters. Under the action of a certain rate load, the generation and propagation process, stress distribution, transfer and displacement field evolution behavior of the meso-fracture between the cement mixture particles are analyzed.

In this study, the application of an existing multiscale friction model is extended to the hot stamping process. The model accounts for the effects of tool and sheet metal surface topography as well as the evolution of contact pressure, temperature, and bulk strain during hot stamping. Normal load flattening and strip drawing experiments are performed to calibrate the model. The results show that the model can relatively well predict friction in strip draw experiments when the tool surface evolution due to wear is incorporated. Finally, the application of the formulated multiscale friction model was demonstrated in the FE simulation of a hot-stamped part.},

In this paper we propose a method to calibrate the model parameters on real data that is based on a novel global sensitivity analysis procedure. The innovative feature of this procedure is that it allows to estimate regression meta-models for the relationship between model parameters and model output without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations to eliminate the effect of randomness. This is achieved by sampling at the same time both the parameters and the seed of the random numbers generator in a random fashion. If correctly specified, the meta-models can be directly used to consistently estimate the average response of the ABM to any parameter vector input by the modeler and, as a consequence, also the distance between real and simulated data. The advantage of the proposed method is twofold: it is very parsimonious in terms of computational time and is relatively easy to implement, being it based on elementary econometric techniques.},

In addition to this, Business Process Modeling (BPM) is a pioneer in introducing process models with domain knowledge representation. Most of the software has similarities based on their operations, structures, validation, and so on. So, an automatic process involvement supports them in terms of cost and duration. This proposed secure Business Process Model will support the development phase and help incorporate the security code along with customer requirements. The proposed Secured Business Process (SecBP) system is an automation process to fine-tune the software engineering design process automatically. Security requirement incorporation requires an image to text and vice versa conversion at the early stages of the software design process. The security integration process is optimized by a decision learning algorithm. Hence the proposed system brings an output model as a domain-specific model with security mapping.},

  abstract  = {Background Despite a strong evidence base and clinical guidelines specifically recommending against prolonged post-procedural antimicrobial use, studies indicate that the practice is common following cardiac device procedures. Formative evaluations conducted by the study team suggest that inappropriate antimicrobial use may be driven by information silos that drive provider belief that antimicrobials are not harmful, in part due to lack of complete feedback about all types of clinical outcomes. De-implementation is recognized as an important area of research that can lead to reductions in unnecessary, wasteful, or harmful practices, such as excess antimicrobial use following cardiac device procedures; however, investigations into strategies that lead to successful de-implementation are limited. The overarching hypothesis to be tested in this trial is that a bundle of implementation strategies that includes audit and feedback about direct patient harms caused by inappropriate prescribing can lead to successful de-implementation of guideline-discordant care. Methods We propose a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation stepped-wedge intervention trial at three high-volume, high-complexity VA medical centers. The main study intervention (an informatics-based, real-time audit-and-feedback tool) was developed based on learning/unlearning theory and formative evaluations and guided by the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) Framework. Elements of the bundled and multifaceted implementation strategy to promote appropriate prescribing will include audit-and-feedback reports that include information about antibiotic harms, stakeholder engagement, patient and provider education, identification of local champions, and blended facilitation. The primary study outcome is adoption of evidence-based practice (de-implementation of inappropriate antimicrobial use). Clinical outcomes (cardiac device infections, acute kidney injuries and Clostridioides difficile infections) are secondary. Qualitative interviews will assess relevant implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, fidelity, feasibility). Discussion De-implementation theory suggests that factors that may have a particularly strong influence on de-implementation include strength of the underlying evidence, the complexity of the intervention, and patient and provider anxiety and fear about changing an established practice. This study will assess whether a multifaceted intervention mapped to identified de-implementation barriers leads to measurable improvements in provision of guideline-concordant antimicrobial use. Findings will improve understanding about factors that impact successful or unsuccessful de-implementation of harmful or wasteful healthcare practices.

  abstract  = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration is the fundamental indicator of soil health, underpinning food production and climate change mitigation. SOC storage is highly sensitive to several dynamic environmental drivers, with approximately one third of soils degraded and losing carbon worldwide. Digital soil mapping illuminates where hotspots of SOC storage occur and where losses to the atmosphere are most likely. Yet, attempts to map SOC often disagree. Here we compare national scale SOC concentration map products to reveal agreement of data in mineral soils, with progressively poorer agreement in organo-mineral and organic soils. Divergences in map predictions from each other and survey data widen in the high SOC content land types we stratified. Given the disparities are highest in carbon rich soils, efforts are required to reduce these uncertainties to increase confidence in mapping SOC storage and predicting where change may be important at national to global scales. Our map comparison results could be used to identify SOC risk where concentrations are high and should be conserved, and where uncertainty is high and further monitoring should be targeted. Reducing inter-map uncertainty will rely on addressing statistical limitations and including covariates that capture convergence of physical factors that produce high SOC contents.},

  abstract  = {Transcriptional terminators signal where transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) should halt and disassociate from DNA. However, because termination is stochastic, two different forms of transcript could be produced: one ending at the terminator and the other reading through. An ability to control the abundance of these transcript isoforms would offer bioengineers a mechanism to regulate multi-gene constructs at the level of transcription. Here, we explore this possibility by repurposing terminators as ‘transcriptional valves’ that can tune the proportion of RNAP read-through. Using one-pot combinatorial DNA assembly, we iteratively construct 1780 transcriptional valves for T7 RNAP and show how nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) can be used to characterize entire libraries of valves simultaneously at a nucleotide resolution in vitro and unravel genetic design principles to tune and insulate termination. Finally, we engineer valves for multiplexed regulation of CRISPR guide RNAs. This work provides new avenues for controlling transcription and demonstrates the benefits of long-read sequencing for exploring complex sequence-function landscapes. Transcriptional terminators are generally viewed as hard endpoints for transcribing RNA polymerases. Here, the authors reimagine terminators as transcriptional valves with predictable read through. They engineer and characterize 1780 valves and use them for multiplexed gene regulation.},

  abstract  = {Behavior trees are a control architecture that has gained recent attention in AI and robotics. Previous research on the use of behavior trees in swarm robotics has shown the necessity for the behaviors to have proper return values, instead of running indefinitely. This work extends our previous work in which we defined AutoMoDe- Cedrata , an automatic modular design that makes use of modules that have been explicitly defined for behavior trees. While the search space is sufficiently large to include well-performing solutions, Cedrata had problems discovering communication-based strategies. In this work, we extend Cedrata by introducing Cedrata-GP and Cedrata-GE which are based on genetic programming and grammatical evolution, respectively. We test these design methods on two missions and compare the performance of the automatic design methods against the performance of solutions created by human designers. The results show that the structure of Cedrata allows for well-performing solutions that are reliably found by human designers. However, the automatic design methods fail to discover the same communication strategies as the human designers.},

  volume    = {27},
  abstract  = {Context The microservices architectural style is gaining momentum in the IT industry. This style does not guarantee that a target system can continuously meet acceptable performance levels. The ability to study the violations of performance requirements and eventually predict them would help practitioners to tune techniques like dynamic load balancing or horizontal scaling to achieve the resilience property. Objective The goal of this work is to study the violations of performance requirements of microservices through time series analysis and provide practical instruments that can detect resilient and non-resilient microservices and possibly predict their performance behavior. Method We introduce a new method based on growth theory to model the occurrences of violations of performance requirements as a stochastic process. We applied our method to an in-vitro e-commerce benchmark and an in-production real-world telecommunication system. We interpreted the resulting growth models to characterize the microservices in terms of their transient performance behavior. Results Our empirical evaluation shows that, in most of the cases, the non-linear S-shaped growth models capture the occurrences of performance violations of resilient microservices with high accuracy. The bounded nature associated with this models tell that the performance degradation is limited and thus the microservice is able to come back to an acceptable performance level even under changes in the nominal number of concurrent users. We also detect cases where linear models represent a better description. These microservices are not resilient and exhibit constant growth and unbounded performance violations over time. The application of our methodology to a real in-production system identified additional resilience profiles that were not observed in the in-vitro experiments. These profiles show the ability of services to react differently to the same solicitation. We found that when a service is resilient it can either decrease the rate of the violations occurrences in a continuous manner or with repeated attempts (periodical or not). Conclusions We showed that growth theory can be successfully applied to study the occurences of performance violations of in-vitro and in-production real-world systems. Furthermore, the cost of our model calibration heuristics, based on the mathematical expression of the selected non-linear growth models, is limited. We discussed how the resulting models can shed some light on the trend of performance violations and help engineers to spot problematic microservice operations that exhibit performance issues. Thus, meaningful insights from the application of growth theory have been derived to characterize the behavior of (non) resilient microservices operations.},

We aimed to summarize the cost-effectiveness literature on CMR for CAD and create a cost-effectiveness calculator, useable worldwide, to approximate the cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) of CMR and relevant comparators with context-specific patient-level and system-level inputs. Methods We searched the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and PubMed for cost-per-QALY or cost-per-life-year-saved studies of CMR to detect significant CAD. We also developed a linear regression meta-model (CMR Cost-Effectiveness Calculator) based on a larger CMR cost-effectiveness simulation model that can approximate CMR lifetime discount cost, QALY, and cost effectiveness compared to relevant comparators [such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)] or invasive coronary angiography. Results CMR was cost-effective for evaluation of significant CAD (either health-improving and cost saving or having a cost-per-QALY or cost-per-life-year result lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold) versus its relevant comparator in 10 out of 15 studies, with 3 studies reporting uncertain cost effectiveness, and 2 studies showing CCTA was optimal. Our cost-effectiveness calculator showed that CCTA was not cost-effective in the US compared to CMR when the most recent publications on imaging performance were included in the model. Conclusions Based on current world-wide evidence in the literature, CMR usually represents a cost-effective option compared to relevant comparators to assess for significant CAD.},

  abstract  = {Background The advancement of science and technologies play an immense role in the way scientific experiments are being conducted. Understanding how experiments are performed and how results are derived has become significantly more complex with the recent explosive growth of heterogeneous research data and methods. Therefore, it is important that the provenance of results is tracked, described, and managed throughout the research lifecycle starting from the beginning of an experiment to its end to ensure reproducibility of results described in publications. However, there is a lack of interoperable representation of end-to-end provenance of scientific experiments that interlinks data, processing steps, and results from an experiment’s computational and non-computational processes. Results We present the “REPRODUCE-ME” data model and ontology to describe the end-to-end provenance of scientific experiments by extending existing standards in the semantic web. The ontology brings together different aspects of the provenance of scientific studies by interlinking non-computational data and steps with computational data and steps to achieve understandability and reproducibility. We explain the important classes and properties of the ontology and how they are mapped to existing ontologies like PROV-O and P-Plan. The ontology is evaluated by answering competency questions over the knowledge base of scientific experiments consisting of computational and non-computational data and steps. Conclusion We have designed and developed an interoperable way to represent the complete path of a scientific experiment consisting of computational and non-computational steps. We have applied and evaluated our approach to a set of scientific experiments in different subject domains like computational science, biological imaging, and microscopy.},

  abstract  = {Model-driven development (MDD) tools allow software development teams to increase productivity and decrease software time-to-market. Although several MDD tools have been proposed, they are not commonly adopted by software development practitioners. Some authors have noted MDD tools are poorly adopted due to a lack of user assistance during modeling-related tasks. This has led model-driven engineers—i.e., engineers who create MDD tools—to equip MDD tools with intelligent assistants, wizards for creating models, consistency checkers, and other modeling assistants to address such assist-modeling-related issues. However, is this the way MDD users expect to be assisted during modeling in MDD tools? Therefore, we plan and conduct two focus groups with MDD users. We extract data around three main research questions: i) what are the challenges perceived by MDD users during modeling for later code generation? ii) what are the features of the current modeling assistants that users like/dislike? and iii) what are the user’s needs that are not yet satisfied by the current modeling assistants? As a result, we gather requirements from the MDD users’ perspective on how they would like to be assisted while using MDD tools. We propose an emerging framework for assisting MDD users during modeling based on such requirements. In addition, we outline future challenges and research efforts for next-generation MDD tools.},

  abstract  = {Metamodeling platforms are an important cornerstone for building domain-specific modeling languages in an efficient and effective way. Two prominent players in the field are ADOxx and the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) which both provide rich ecosystems on modeling support and related technologies. However, until now, these two worlds live in isolation while there would be several benefits of having a bridge to exchange metamodels and models for different purposes (e.g., reuse of features and plugins that are only available on one platform, access to additional modeler and developer communities). Therefore, in this paper, we propose first steps toward establishing interoperability between ADOxx and EMF. For this, we thoroughly analyze the metamodeling concepts employed by both platforms before proposing a bridge that enables bidirectional exchange of metamodels. We evaluate the bidirectional bridge with several openly available metamodels created with ADOxx and EMF, respectively. Moreover, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the bridge by an evaluation that incorporates the instantiation and use of the metamodels on both platforms. We show that the metamodels can be exchanged without information loss and similar modeling experiences with respect to the resulting models can be achieved.},

In this approach, we demonstrate how to capture the core concepts of operations on models in our formalism MetaMorph to allow for an extension of the formal definition of a language’s syntax with a precise but platform-independent specification of language functionality. We understand as a model a series of model states that flow into one another through the interaction of the modeler and provided operations. Thereby, we distinguish structural events for the basic changes and domain events for the semantic-aware operations on models, as well as model operations in the creation phase and the operationalization phase of a model. To examine our considerations on an example, we employ ProVis , a modeling method for stochastic education.},

This paper proposes a highly efficient transformative hardware design methodology that leverages graph-grammar-based model transformations. Following the proposed methodology, main design functionalities and aspectual instrumentation are separately developed, automatically integrated, and verified. To demonstrate the applicability, industrial SoCs were transformed to support on-chip debug. Compared to the manual RTL coding, the proposed transformative methodology needed less than 32x Lines of Code (LoC) to develop and integrate the aspectual instrumentation. In particular, our approach enables high code reusability, as the implementation of the transformation script is a one-time effort, and can be applied to all evaluated SoCs. This high LoC gain and code reuse promote the overall productivity of digital design.},

Collaboration between multiple stakeholders is needed to deal with this complexity. While collaboration has been studied extensively in process modelling, there is a lack of research in collaborative process design. In this paper, we propose a model of collaboration in process design, based on the co-evolution of design ideas across different process designers. We show how this model can be used for testing hypotheses related to task openness, modes of collaboration, and modelling tools. Research models based on co-evolution are proposed for testing each hypothesis. The co-evolution model can advance our understanding of process design by providing a basis for empirically studying the contextual factors likely to contribute to collaborative ideation.},

  abstract  = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, devices and systems generate enormous amounts of real-time data, and demand real-time analytics in an uninterrupted manner. The typical solution, a cloud-centred architecture providing an analytics service, cannot guarantee real-time responsiveness because of unpredictable workloads and network congestion. Recently, edge computing has been proposed as a solution to reduce latency in critical systems. For computation processing and analytics on edge, the challenges include handling the heterogeneity of devices and data, and achieving processing on the edge in order to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. In this paper, we show how low-code, model-driven approaches benefit a Digital Platform for Edge analytics. The first solution uses EdgeX, an IIoT framework for supporting heterogeneous architectures with the eKuiper rule-based engine. The engine schedules fully automatically tasks that retrieve data from the Edge, as the infrastructure near the data is generated, allowing us to create a continuous flow of information. The second solution uses FiWARE, an IIoT framework used in industry, using IoT agents to accomplish a pipeline for edge analytics. In our architecture, based on the DIME LC/NC Integrated Modelling Environment, both integrations of EdgeX/eKuyper and FiWARE happen by adding an External Native DSL to this Digital Platform. The DSL comprises a family of reusable Service-Independent Building blocks (SIBs), which are the essential modelling entities and (service) execution capabilities in the architecture’s modelling layer. They provide users with capabilities to connect, control and organise devices and components, and develop custom workflows in a simple drag and drop manner.},

  abstract  = {In response to the difficulties of traditional antenna collaborative design, high cost of solutions evaluation and ambiguous indexes relationship, we proposed the model-driven system scheme feasibility evaluation method. Based on the Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), the Domain-specified Modeling Language (DSML) of antenna is formed by constructing the antenna system metamodel framework. And we introduce the system engineering performance evaluation methods to system modelling, establish the hierarchical analysis models, support the automatic acquisition and calculation of assessment data through system model process simulation and validation analysis, and then complete scientific decision-making of system solutions. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by the antenna drive scheme design. The results show that the feasibility evaluation method based on MBSE can significantly improve the design optimization results and the development decision efficiency, and reduce the costs of design and evaluation.},

Executable documentation goes a step further by turning domain-specific notation and documentation languages typically used in the requirements and the design phase into fully-fledged modeling/programming languages. The resulting so-called Purpose-Specific Languages are meant to tighten the semantic gap, while directly covering the what , providing the how via automated transformation, and reduce the handwritten part to why the project is of importance. We will illustrate the impact of this approach in the DevOps scenario where we turn the graphical notation GitLab provides for documenting CI/CD workflows into an Integrated Modeling Environment called Rig . At a larger scale, Rig can be seen as part of our Language-Driven Engineering approach where it covers the aspect of CI/CD at the modeling level with a push-button link towards execution. This turns the corresponding running system into the ‘ultimate’ documentation where the understanding of all stakeholders should converge.},

Although a number of process models and standards simplify the management of manufacturing equipment, there is still a lack of suitable free software applications and frameworks that incorporate new trends. The increasing need for self-organized production systems in adaptive manufacturing environments poses a particular challenge. This paper examines the current state of model-driven software development in self-organized adaptive production systems and proposes a tool that bridges the gap between asset management and configuration of a self-organized production system. The resulting system is developed and tested against a real self-organized production system, and the following research efforts are derived from the findings gained throughout the testing process.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {System-level requirements and non-functional properties pose a significant modelling challenge in software-intensive robotic systems where the software components are developed by different vendors. It is often a manual and empirically non-verifiable proposition to check all non-functional claims made by a software component and to compose a system with confidence. System-level observance of non-functional properties is key to establish their compliance with system-level requirements, which at present is mostly solely a subjective judgement of the system builder. A crucial next step in system composition policy should be to enforce encapsulation of system-level properties within the functional body of the component. A software component should be capable of informing its peers how system-level properties are modified across services that it provides. Tracking system-level properties across components is a desired mechanism to verify compliance of system-level requirements. Monitoring these properties is desired during (i) component development for debugging, (ii) system composition for adequate component selection, and (iii) at run-time for diagnosis and enforcement. This paper presents Smart Dependency Graphs “SmartDG”, an addition to the RobMoSys compliant SmartMDSD toolchain, to model system-level dependencies between robotic software components. In SmartDG methodology, component developers implement transfer functions for dependency objects defined by domain experts, which enables system builders to trace system-level properties via dependency graphs. SmartDG provides a structural template to model system-level requirements to allow for an empirically verifiable composition of a robotic software system.},

  abstract  = {In state-of-the-art approaches, requirements are gradually encoded into the model, with each modeling step being verified . Once the modeling and verification process has finished, code generation is usually applied to generate the final product. Finally, the generated code is validated , e.g., by executing tests, or running simulations. At this point, stakeholders and domain experts are actively incorporated into the development process. Especially in industrial applications, validation is as important as verification . Thus, it is important to integrate the stakeholders’ and the domain experts’ feedback as early as possible. In this work, we propose two approaches to tackle this: (1) a static export of an animation trace into a single HTML file, and (2) a dynamic export of a classical B model to an interactive HTML document, both with a domain-specific visualization. For the second approach, we extend the high-level code generator B2Program by JavaScript, and integrate VisB visualizations. An important aspect here is to ease communication between modelers and domain experts, which is achieved by implementing features to share animated traces, and giving feedback to each other.},

  abstract  = {During the last decades the interest to study User Interfaces (UI) has increased. However, the learning of UI design is a difficult process. To obtain better results, novel UI designers need guidance through this process. Feedback is among the most important factors to improve knowledge and skill acquisition. Nevertheless, the complexity of providing individual feedback is remarkable: it is a time-consuming task and requires a fair amount of expertise. This paper presents the Feedback ENriched user Interface Simulation (FENIkS) as a solution to this problem. FENIkS is a UI design simulation tool, based on model-driven engineering. The students design the UI through different models while automatically receiving feedback on how design principles have been applied through several options. From the models it is possible to generate a working prototype, enriched with feedback that explains the application of design principles. This paper describes the foundations of FENIkS for the automatic UI design evaluation that further allows generating automatic feedback. It explains FENIkS’ design: the meta-model and how design options, design principles and types of feedback are used to automatically generate feedback. The perceived usability was positive evaluated. The results of the experimental evaluation demonstrated that FENIkS improves students’ understanding of design principles.},

The model would be the “ground truth” used, for example, for downstream code synthesis and simulation; the graphical views would typically be abstractions from the model serving various purposes, including documentation. Twelve years later, we reflect on their proposal, and illustrate the current state with the recently developed polyglot coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). LF has been designed with pragmatics in mind since early on, and some characteristics of LF make it particularly suited for pragmatics-aware programming and modeling. However, the underlying pragmatic principles are broadly applicable, and by now a set of mature open source tools is available for putting them into practice.},

  abstract  = {As systems grow in complexity, systems engineers have embraced Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to tackle this complexity. The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is the most commonly used language by the systems engineers to implement MBSE. SysML is not highly capable of expressing conceptual but not executable models. In order to perform requirements/behavior verifications, systems engineers/designers mostly use separate simulation tools. Hence, the efficiency of the systems engineering process is often reduced due to the isolated and consecutive use of both SysML modeling tool and other simulation tools, for example, defining simulation inputs to each simulation tool separately. Hence, executable SysML is the next logical step towards achieving true MBSE support for all systems engineering activities in the life cycle phases – system requirements, analysis, design, implementation, integration, verification, transition, validation, acceptance testing, training, and maintenance. Therefore, various research efforts are being conducted to develop executable SysML modeling approaches. This research develops a SysML Executable Modeling Methodology (SEMM), which is demonstrated by modeling a CubeSat-based Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system in SysML. The SysML SSA-CubeSat system model is made executable by integrating with Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) simulation software, namely, Systems Tool Kit (STK) and MATLAB, following the approaches defined in the SEMM.},

To keep requirements complexity under control, system components are specified by separate models, validated and verified in isolation from the rest, but models have to be subsequently integrated and validated as a whole. For this reason, engines for orchestrated simulation of separate models are extremely useful. In this paper, we present a compositional simulation technique for managing the co-execution of Abstract State Machines (ASMs) communicating through I/O events. The proposed method allows the co-simulation of ASM models of separate subsystems of a Discrete Event System in a straight-through processing manner according to a predefined orchestration schema.

  abstract  = {In a world of ever-increasing complexity, the smooth functioning of society is critically dependent on our ability to understand and manage both individual systems and complex ecosystems of systems. Models, combined with tools to reason about them, can provide a way to do this. In order for rigorous reasoning about models to be possible, they must have a robust mathematical foundation, which must also support tools for the engineering principles—compositionality, interfaces, and local reasoning—that are required to enable the practical construction of models of ecosystems. In this paper, we present a vision for a system of modelling, based on the concept of distributed systems as a metaphor for ecosystems of systems, that captures these requirements. We describe a mathematical foundation, identify the engineering principles needed, and show how they can be built in a rigorous way that preserves the ability to reason when dealing with complex, large-scale ecosystem models. We illustrate our ideas with examples and briefly explain how they apply in a practical modelling project.},

  abstract  = {Multi-strut platform is widely used for precise instrument vibration isolation. In this paper, a Newton-Euler based 6-DOF 12-strut platform model is proposed. Nonlinearity of platform dynamic component is derived by establishing polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) system. To guarantee the linearization accuracy of LPV system while reducing model elements to a real-time computing level. Tensor product(TP) model transformation and truncated high-order singular value decomposition(HOSVD) are used to decompose LPV system high-order tensor into unique principle basis. Then low-rank approximation of system is implemented by discarding minor singular basis vectors, for the sake of minimizing storage space and computing complexity. And then the parameter varying system is represented by convex combination of discretized system vertexes. So quadratic regulator method can be applied to vertex linear time-invariant subsystem controller to construct the global controller. Performance of the proposed multi-strut platform is demonstrated through hardware in loop simulation.},

  abstract  = {Mixing formal methods (such as B) and ontology description languages is a promising approach to develop reliable, safe and secure systems. In fact, both techniques have demonstrated their strengths to handle ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness of requirements. However, domain knowledge evolves continuously throughout the application life-cycle and hence different change requirements must be addressed. Several problems have to be managed in the ontology evolution process particularly change impact analysis and resolution. Among existing works, pattern-driven techniques have been proposed to provide guidance during the ontology evolution so that it remains consistent. The underlying process is often informal and mostly methodological; and consequently automation efforts are still required. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pattern-driven approach built on an executable formal definition of the Ontology Web Language (OWL), that we call xOWL . In order to ensure the execution, the debugging and the correctness of existing patterns, we instrumented xOWL using the B method and the Meeduse language workbench.},

  abstract  = {Compositions of future airborne forces with highly automated and/or autonomous components shall be assessed in terms of mission effectiveness and efficiency through a modelling and simulation process. To this end, we have proposed a systematic metric derivation and measurement scheme in previous work. Now, its evaluation and validation were conducted through subject-matter experts (SMEs), who agree with the assessment outcomes and attest to their meaningfulness when comparing their judgements of the simulated example mission runs with the generated results. In this paper, a representative vignette for reconnaissance by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is established together with different mission execution plans to enable and test a more general use of the process in a multi-agent simulation testbed. Additionally, a complementary concept for the derivation of suitable force compositions from archetypes, which represent specific categories of aircraft, is put forward based on a morphological approach. These force compositions’ capabilities were matched to the requirements of the respective mission vignette and subsequently simulation-based comparative assessments were conducted. These assessments relied on criteria hierarchically derived from the specific vignette’s mission tasks and objectives. Therefore, we propose metrics for mission success and effort sensitive to the number of entities and the composition of force packages. We conducted simulation of several variants and replications to cover different random variables and mission execution plans to generate assessments for different force compositions and mission plans. Eventually, the derivation of a simplified metamodel for the estimation of mission efficiency using the most influential input variables was attempted.},

Despite automation progress, manual tasks performed by humans (such as maintenance) remain, and while complicated tasks can be supported by Augmented Reality (AR) devices, they remain insufficiently integrated into global production processes. To seamlessly integrate process automation, IIoT context, and AR, this paper contributes BPMN-CARX, a Context and Augmented Reality eXtension (CARX) for BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and the CARX Framework, which enables AR and IIoT context integration with existing Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs).

  abstract  = {Tightly coupled task-based multiscale models do not scale when implemented using a traditional workflow management system. This is because the fine-grained task parallelism of such applications cannot be exploited efficiently due to scheduling and communication overheads. Existing tools and frameworks allow implementing efficient task-level parallelism, however with high programming effort. On the other hand, Dask and Parsl are Python libraries for low-effort up-scaling of task-parallel applications but still require considerable programming effort and do not equally provide functions for optimal task scheduling. By extending the wfGenes tool with new generators and a static task graph scheduler, we enhance Dask and Parsl to tackle these deficiencies and to generate optimized input for these systems from a simple application description and enable rapid design of scalable task-parallel multiscale applications relying on thorough graph analysis and automatic code generation. The performance of the generated code has been analyzed by using random task graphs with up to 10,000 nodes and executed on thousands of CPU cores. The approach implemented in wfGenes is beneficial for improving the usability and increasing the exploitation of existing tools, and for increasing productivity of multiscale modeling scientists.},

  abstract  = {A novel fast Kalman filtering algorithm according to the polytopic linear differential inclusion (PLDI) was proposed in this paper to improve the real-time performance of positioning algorithms, and reduce the complexity of online programming in multi-mode satellite navigation systems (MSNS). Firstly, it is proved that the error system of a multi-mode satellite navigation system can be described by a PLDI system model, based on which the tensor product (TP) model transformation method is then used to transform the error system into a PLDI system. Then, linear filtering is performed for each PLDI vertex system, and the optimal estimation of the multi-mode satellite navigation error system is obtained by fusion of the estimates for each vertex system based on the global optimal estimation theory and data confusion method. Compared with the traditional nonlinear filtering method, the Fast Kalman Filer carries out linearization of nonlinear systems using a global linearization method, and the Jacobian matrices does not need to be updated online during filtering, which significantly reduces the complexity of online programming and computation. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are verified by the simulation results, and a preferable estimate performance for the GPS/BD-2 integrated satellite navigation are obtained.},

  abstract  = {As spatial and temporal resolutions of scientific instruments improve, the explosion in the volume of data produced is becoming a key challenge. It can be a critical bottleneck for integration between scientific instruments at the edge and high-performance computers/emerging accelerators. Placing data compression or reduction logic close to the data source is a possible approach to solve the bottleneck. However, the realization of such a solution requires the development of custom ASIC designs, which is still challenging in practice and tends to produce one-off implementations unusable beyond the initial intended scope. Therefore, as a feasibility study, we have been investigating a design workflow that allows us to explore algorithmically complex hardware designs and develop reusable hardware libraries for the needs of scientific instruments at the edge. Our vision is to cultivate our hardware development capability for streaming/dataflow hardware components that can be placed close to the data source to enable extreme data-intensive scientific experiments or environmental sensing. Furthermore, reducing data movement is essential to improving computing performance in general. Therefore, our co-design efforts on streaming hardware components can benefit computing applications other than scientific instruments. This vision paper discusses hardware specialization needs in scientific instruments and briefly reviews our progress leveraging the Chisel hardware description language and emerging open-source hardware ecosystems, including a few design examples.},

We discuss how to model a simplified bang-bang ABS controller using model-driven methods. We design a Scilab Xcos block diagram based on a physical model and suggest how to solve it numerically. Thanks to numerical solution methods, it is possible to move from pre-estimated graphical models to computer programs in order to check given scenarios of the system operation. To test the technique on a real system, we examine the slip value measurement method based on real trips with braking and discuss the result graphs. We propose to use EU certification documents for the basis of requirements, so we discuss how to calculate the utilization of adhesion parameter based on the model.},

  abstract  = {Limiting the energy consumption of IoT nodes is a hot topic in green computing. For battery-powered devices this necessity is obvious, but the enormous growth of the number of IoT nodes makes energy efficiency important for every node in the IoT. In this paper, we show how we can automatically compute execution intervals for our task-oriented programs for the IoT. These intervals offer the possibility to save energy by bringing the microprocessor driving the IoT node into a low-power sleep mode until the task need to be executed. Furthermore, they offer an elegant way to add interrupts to the system. We do allow an arbitrary number of tasks on the IoT nodes and achieve significant reductions of the energy consumption by bringing the microprocessor in sleep mode as much as possible. We have seen energy reductions of an order of magnitude without imposing any constraints on the tasks to be executed on the IoT nodes.},

  abstract  = {Developing a system for an interconnected world presents various challenges, from demanding disrupting technologies to a higher context-sensitivity. To solve these challenges, we researched the application of a modern understanding of roles for business process modeling. Roles are an approach with a long history in business process models and a proven value in other modeling perspectives. They provide multiple benefits, such as unifying structural and behavioral modeling and a rich adaptation of reference models. Furthermore, as we prove in this paper, a modern understanding of roles can be implemented as a standard conform BPMN extension. Based on these benefits, we chose a design science approach to develop the role-based BPMN extension RBPMN, which we present in this paper. We demonstrate how RBPMN unleashes the power of roles to overcome modern business process modeling challenges and briefly evaluate our approach. The use of roles with a coherent understanding at every abstraction level supports modelers and engineers equally in developing systems for an interconnected ever-changing world.},

Based on the lumped parameter method and geometric optics, the energy flow model of the laser system is established, and the unified theoretical modeling of the opto-mechanical coupling system is achieved. The research results of this paper will be applied to the unified modeling and co-simulation of the opto-mechanical coupling system, providing a theoretical and technical basis for the high-precision and efficient design verification of laser equipment.},

Therefore, this paper aims to design and implement a modeling and simulation tool with graphical modeling function based on AltaRica 3.0. The main work includes the following aspects: Firstly, a text editor for modeling is constructed. Fault model compilation, fault tree generation and fault tree analysis are implemented based on OpenAltaRica’s engines and Arbre Analyste tool. Secondly, a graph editor is constructed, and the functions of loading, modifying and saving graph models are realized. Then, a simulation method based on step simulation engine is designed and implemented. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the modeling and simulation method are verified through the analysis of an example system.},

The surgeon has the opportunity to influence the refractive state of the eye for optimal postoperative visual acuity by choosing an appropriate IOL. In addition, a certain group of patients has an ametropia called corneal astigmatism, which needs to be corrected with a so-called toric IOL, in which the key criterion for the success of the correction is its angular position in the capsular bag. Deviation from the intended angular position of the implanted lens can lead to refractive surprise, i.e. the patient's postoperative visual acuity does not reach 100},

  abstract  = {The Research group in Acquisition and representation of knowledge through expert systems and simulation “ARCOSES” (for its acronym in Spanish) developed a hybrid methodology composed of several techniques of Industrial Engineering to select the best scenario in a simulation process when there are multiple performance measures. This situation is typically presented in case of business improvement processes, where is necessary to balance different performance measures and in some cases, these are possibly in conflict. When these cases of multiple performance measures occur, it is possible to use different techniques such as design of experiments (DOE), simulation optimization (SO), meta models (MM) or the response surface methodology (MSR). These consist of a set of mathematical and statistical tools; their goal is to select the best solution. However, it has been found that these techniques can be difficult to implement because the analyst or decision-maker does not always have the mathematical bases or enough time for their execution. Therefore, a methodological proposal was developed, presented an implemented in a case of processes of improvement where the best solution is calculated through a standardized homogeneous rating based on the different goals to be achieved.},

Using the average precision as a metric, we can evaluate the results with segmentations while using the full spatiotemporal prediction. Furthermore, by applying a biophysical tumor growth model to 21 patient cases we compare two schemes for fitting and evaluating predictions. By carefully designing a scheme that separates the prediction from the observations used for fitting the model, we show that a better fit of model parameters does not guarantee a better predictive power.},

Therefore, an enterprise model is always a set of sub-models of different semantics. In order to form a consistent enterprise model, its sub-models should be aligned to each other. The practice of modeling shows the difficulties in design of an aligned set of sub-models of an enterprise model. In this paper we present a review of enterprise modeling approaches aiming to find the reasons of difficulties. Our review shows that enterprise modeling approaches not sufficiently use the semantic relations of sub-models for building an enterprise model.

The constraints imposed by sub-models of the enterprise model to each other are illustrated with a case study in ArchiMate.},

Introduced agile games increase students’ ability to appropriately communicate and to work together like a team, which are basic principles of agile methodologies. Teaching agile methodology through games is very beneficial and positively evaluated among participants. Therefore, the presented games can be considered useful for learning the basic principles of agile project management.},

  abstract  = {Unbiased assessment of the predictivity of models learnt by supervised machine learning (ML) methods requires knowledge of the learned function over a reserved test set (not used by the learning algorithm). The quality of the assessment depends, naturally, on the properties of the test set and on the error statistic used to estimate the prediction error. In this work we tackle both issues, proposing a new predictivity criterion that carefully weights the individual observed errors to obtain a global error estimate, and using incremental experimental design methods to “optimally” select the test points on which the criterion is computed. Several incremental constructions are studied, including greedy-packing (coffee-house design), support points and kernel herding techniques. Our results show that the incremental and weighted versions of the latter two, based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy concepts, yield superior performance. An industrial test case provided by the historical French electricity supplier (EDF) illustrates the practical relevance of the methodology, indicating that it is an efficient alternative to expensive cross-validation techniques.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {Industrial robots are increasingly used to drill holes in large-sized components. However, the rigidity of robots is much less than one of similarly sized machine tools for such operations. At the start of drilling operation, radial forces cause tool displacement away from the required ideal position. As a result, the location of the holes is inaccurate. FEM-SPG modeling of the start of the drilling was performed to minimize “drill walking” by predicting the magnitude of radial forces. The twist drill design was described using digital model. The model is suitable for twist drills of any design presented by the state standards of the Russian Federation. In addition, the model describes the actual geometry of the cutting edges, including edge chipping. The Johnson–Cook model was used to characterize the workpiece material properties. Calculations have shown that the forces acting on the drill are periodic in nature. This periodicity is associated with the cyclical nature of the formation and separation of metal particles from the workpiece. These particles are crushed under the tool surfaces near the drill chisel edge, and therefore, the force variation is increased. The obtained graphs of forces and torque correspond to the known data of the theory of chip formation. This is the reason to confirm the adequacy of the obtained models. The obtained values of the magnitude of radial forces make it possible to predict the drill displacement from the ideal position if the industrial manipulating robot with known rigidity is used.},

While the term “persistence” has been in the tool’s acronym from the start, it was chosen to indicate that graphs were maintained in a database with transactional support. Until now, Grape (and GrapePress ) treated graphs as ephemeral data structures, i.e., previous graph versions were not retained upon modification. This paper presents a major revision of the tool (called GrapeVine ) to support functional graph rewriting based on a fully persistent data structure.},

A distributed control protocol is constructed by taking advantage of the nearest neighbor rule. Besides, a model transformation is introduced with the help of the right eigenvector of Laplacian matrix corresponding to the zero eigenvalue, based on which the bipartite consensus problems can be converted into the asymptotic stability problems. The sufficient condition can be developed for the bipartite consensus of structurally balanced signed networks. It is shown that by selecting appropriate coupling gain, structurally balanced signed networks can accomplish the global bipartite consensus objective. By introducing a simulation example, we can demonstrate the correctness of our developed theoretical results.},

The approach rests on Uppaal for formal modelling, graphical reasoning and preliminary property checking, and on Java for enabling large model sizes and execution benefits on a multi-core machine. As a significant case study, the minority game (MG) binary game often used in economics, natural and social sciences is chosen for modelling and analysis. In MG, a population of agents/players compete, without explicit interactions, in the use of a shared and scarce resource. At each step, each player has to decide if to use or not the resource, and by understanding that when the majority of agents decides to exploit the resource, an inevitable congestion would arise. In classic MG, although each player learns from the experience, it is unable to improve its behaviour/performance. A genetic variant of MG is then considered which by using crossover and mutation on local strategies allows a bad-performing player to possibly improve its attitude. The paper shows an MG formal actor model, which is then transformed into Java for parallel execution. Experimental results confirm good execution speedup when the size of the model is scaled to large values, as required by practical applications.},

To face these issues, Model Based System Engineering proposes an approach based on an interconnected multi point of view system modeling. Each representation of the system has a different abstraction level that is valuable at different stages of the system design and suits its own objectives respectively: 1) purposes and global constraints definition, 2) architecture choices, components sizing and strategies testing, 3) accurate simulation results on various scenarios. Interconnections between the different levels have two objectives: on one hand be able to define the requirements of a lower level using higher level information and on the other hand send back simulation variable values from a lower level to evaluate the higher level requirements satisfaction. The different levels design and the development of their interconnections are detailed. Resource management is carried out through a functional model, which is a macroscopic and low-complexity model of the system providing fast simulation results. A method of arbitration between different missions of the system can be introduced in the teleological level. In this paper, this multi-level methodology is applied to the thermal system management of an electric vehicle. A method of arbitration is applied to this use case and then to the whole electric vehicle.},

In this paper, we first attempt to address pan-sharpening in both spatial and frequency domains and propose a Spatial-Frequency Information Integration Network, dubbed as SFIIN. To implement SFIIN, we devise a core building module tailored with pan-sharpening, consisting of three key components: spatial-domain information branch, frequency-domain information branch, and dual domain interaction. To be specific, the first employs the standard convolution to integrate the local information of two modalities of PAN and MS images in the spatial domain, while the second adopts deep Fourier transformation to achieve the image-wide receptive field for exploring global contextual information. Followed by, the third is responsible for facilitating the information flow and learning the complementary representation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network and demonstrate the favorable performance against other state-of-the-art methods.},

We then analyse the effect of packet loss and sensor noise on neighbour sensing in Buzz using a simple aggregation algorithm as a case study. Through infrastructural testing on this physical robot platform, we evaluate how well swarm algorithms developed in Buzz can cope with perturbations. We find that aggregation is reasonably tolerant to packet loss, however struggles to tolerate inaccurate neighbour sensing. Finally, we suggest future work that could mitigate the effect of embedded platform imperfections when developing swarm algorithms in Buzz.},

  abstract  = {Business models research is attracting the interest of both academics and practitioners due to digitalization changing the socio-economic landscape. The digitalization generates many new risks for traditional business models. At the same time, it provides new opportunities for value creation and thus contributes to changes in the enterprises business models. The object of our study is business models in light industry in the context of digitalization. Research works of scientists-economists, data of the research reports carried out by the authors were used to write this article. General scientific methods, system approach, institutional approach was applied during the research. We found that the business model transformation under the influence of digitalization is a process of irreversible essence changes in the mechanism of reproduction of the use value. These changes are due to the introduction of digital technologies and tools in production and business processes, in systems of interaction with other participants in the value chain and consumers as well as in the goods or services. We found that new sources of use value in light industry are emerging under the influence of digitalization as a result of an increase in the speed of design, production and distribution of goods; customization; value chains transformation and dynamic organization of production; the home country reputational capital use; attracting highly qualified personnel to the industry; redistribution of capitalization between individual value creation processes; transition to hybrid value creation models combining virtual and real processes; the domino principle in the digitalization of an enterprise and industry.},

In this paper, we address the question identifying the branches of science by taking advantage of the massive digitization of scientific production. In the framework of complex systems studies, we first formalize the notion of level and scale of knowledge dynamics. Then, we demonstrate how we can reconstruct a reasonably precise and concise multi-scale and multi-level approximation of the dynamical structures of Science: phylomemies. We introduce the notion of phylomemetic networks—projections of phylomemies in low dimensional spaces that can be grasped by the human mind—and propose a new algorithm to reconstruct both phylomemies and the associated phylomemetic networks. This algorithm offers, passing, a new temporal clustering on evolving semantic networks. Last, we show how phylomemy reconstruction can take into account users’ preferences within the framework of embodied cognition, thus defining a third way between the quest for objective “ground truth” and the ad-hoc adaptation to a particular user’s preferences. The robustness of this approach is illustrated by several case studies.},

Stateflow is a component of Simulink for modeling event-driven control via hierarchical state machines and flow charts. However, Stateflow lacks an official formal semantics, making it difficult to formally prove properties of its models in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we define a formal semantics for a large subset of Stateflow, covering complex features such as hierarchical states and transitions, event broadcasts, early return, temporal operators, and so on. The semantics is formalized in Isabelle/HOL and proved to be deterministic. We implement a tactic for automatic execution of the semantics in Isabelle, as well as a translator in Python transforming Stateflow models to the syntax in Isabelle. Using these tools, we validate the semantics against a collection of examples illustrating the features we cover.},

  abstract  = {The Product design and manufacturing of an Airplane is complex and requires the involvement of multiple experts sharing information and knowledge from multi-perspectives within and across institutional boundaries. From the Fourth Industrial Revolution, new concepts are emerging like smart manufacturing, which is a convergence of modern enabling technologies with artificial intelligence to increase manufacturing efficiency and eliminating pain points, ensuring higher quality levels and customization. Models for Manufacturing (MfM) is a recent methodology that presents an organization to formally defined information and knowledge. However, MfM does not consider information tracking and inconsistencies analysis across the PLM phases. Based on this context, this research explores the proposal of a Product Design and Manufacturing Knowledge-based system (PDMKBs) based on MfM and Semantic Web Technologies. PDMKBs is composed of 4-layers: ontology layer; semantic resolution     alignment layer; Application     Analysis Layer and Data Layer. OWL and Semantic rules are used to formalize the information and knowledge and to share, convert or translate information from multiple perspectives to infer the relation between multiple product design and manufacturing levels. The PDMKBs was tested in the tooling design to manufacturing a sheet metal part of the A400M. The main research contributions are: (i) the well-defined structure to formalize heterogeneous information and knowledge; (ii) the improvement of information and knowledge exchange between heterogeneous domains across different phases of the manufacturing process.},

  abstract  = {Accurately finding proteins and genes that have a certain function is the prerequisite for a broad range of biomedical applications. Despite the encouraging progress of existing computational approaches in protein function prediction, it remains challenging to annotate proteins to a novel function that is not collected in the Gene Ontology and does not have any annotated proteins. This limitation, a “side effect” from the widely-used multi-label classification problem setting of protein function prediction, hampers the progress of studying new pathways and biological processes, and further slows down research in various biomedical areas. Here, we tackle this problem by annotating proteins to a function only based on its textual description so that we don’t need to know any associated proteins for this function. The key idea of our method ProTranslator is to redefine protein function prediction as a machine translation problem, which translates the description word sequence of a function to the amino acid sequence of a protein. We can then transfer annotations from functions that have similar textual description to annotate a novel function. We observed substantial improvement in annotating novel functions and sparsely annotated functions on CAFA3, SwissProt and GOA datasets. We further demonstrated how our method accurately predicted gene members for a given pathway in Reactome, KEGG and MSigDB only based on the pathway description. Finally, we showed how ProTranslator enabled us to generate the textual description instead of the function label for a set of proteins, providing a new scheme for protein function prediction. We envision ProTranslator will give rise to a protein function “search engine” that returns a list of proteins based on the free text queried by the user.},

However, existing MPST tools support only unilingual programming (homogeneity), while many real-world distributed systems are engineered using multilingual programming (heterogeneity).

However, the prototype suffered from few deficiencies, such as allowing non-intuitive combinations of expressions and usage of temporal specifiers that quickly got difficult to understand. This paper builds on the T-EARS prototype and input from experienced testers on a previous iteration of the language. The collected experience was applied to a new prototype using a structured update process, including a set of system-level requirements from a vehicular software system. The results include a new, improved grammar for the T-EARS language and a description of the evaluation semantics.},

  abstract  = {In the early stage of aircraft design, it is of great significance to make rapid and accurate evaluation of aerodynamic characteristics. Compared with the traditional high-cost or inaccurate evaluation methods, such as wind tunnel test, CFD simulation and engineering calculation, surrogate model has the advantage of low cost and high speed, but its prediction accuracy depends on the training samples, which is obtained from expensive evaluation. The traditional one-stage sampling method is blind, which may cause unnecessary evaluations. Adaptive sequential sampling can effectively reduce the number of sample points, but it may lead to neglect of complex regions and reduce the confidence of the overall prediction. Therefore, we proposed a novel sequential method which reweights the sampling point utility by experts’ prior knowledge of vague understanding for complex/simple regions. By comparing with Latin Hypercube and general adaptive sequential sampling method, the effectiveness of the method is verified on vertical force increment and axial force increment. It is proved that our method can obviously reduce the number of sampling points which provides a basis of aerodynamic characteristics prediction. Moreover, it improves the accuracy of complex regions with only a slight negative effect on simple regions.},

This paper researches the possibility to use micro frontend architecture for frontend code reusability. The goal of this paper is to achieve code reusability by providing a good organizational structure by using a micro frontend approach. Reusing the code should help to increase the time to market and allow for better scalability. The paper starts by overviewing the base characteristics of domain-driven design as one of the key concepts behind micro frontend architecture. It continues with evaluating existing micro frontend architectures by a set of defined qualitative attributes. Lastly, it uses the findings from the evaluation in building a technical solution. The implementation process can be divided into two phases: decomposition of an existing frontend application; reusing the code by integrating the decomposed components in a new micro frontend application. The results of the implementation process should confirm the micro frontend approach for code reusability.},

Cities are problem owners and living labs for finding solutions through design-enabled innovation initiatives. However, to reach collective impact, it is paramount that these initiatives can learn from one another and align efforts through collaborative sensemaking. In the MappingDESIGNSCAPES project, we piloted a participatory collaboration mapping approach for cross-case sensemaking across design-enabled urban innovation initiatives. We used the CommunitySensor methodology for participatory community network mapping and the Kumu online network visualization tool to help representatives of three urban prototype cases share and collectively make sense of their design lessons. In this first of two papers, we describe how we set up the MappingDESIGNSCAPES project as part of the DESIGNSCAPES urban design innovations R   D program; how we created a conceptual model of the collaboration ecosystems around design-enabled urban innovations; and co-created a visual knowledge base centered around the case and cross-case maps grounded in this conceptual model. We end this paper with a discussion of participatory mapping lessons learned. In the accompanying paper [ 1 ], we show how we used this visual knowledge base to drive a process of collaborative sensemaking to share lessons learned across cases.},

Reconfiguration, context-awareness, and security features are becoming necessary for the smart and reliable behavior of future electricity grids. Several software solutions have been proposed to improve the development of such features. However, there is still a need to a software solution that clarify the relation between reconfiguration and context as well as facilitate their development all with satisfying complex needs such the real-time, coordination, and security needs. In this paper, we propose a solution for easy implementation of reconfigurations originated by a context change. We extend an existing software framework dedicated to the development of context-aware reconfigurable applications with mechanisms that handles the contexts in the controller. This paper explores the usage of the said framework as an infrastructure for general purpose SG applications. To show the suitability of the proposed concepts, a formal case of microgrids reconfigurations is conducted.},

  abstract  = {Musculoskeletal models (MMs) driven by electromyography (EMG) signals have been used to predict human movements. Muscle excitations of MMs are generally the amplitude of EMG, which shows large variability even when repeating the same task. The general structure of muscle synergies has been proved to be consistent across test sessions, providing a perspective for extracting stable control information for MMs. Although non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a common method for extracting synergies, the factorization result of NMF is not unique. In this study, we proposed an improved NMF algorithm for extracting stable control information of MMs to predict hand and wrist motions. Specifically, we supplemented the Hadamard product and L 2-norm regularization term to the objective function of NMF. The proposed NMF was utilized to identify stable muscle synergies. Then, the time-varying profile of each synergy was fed into a subject-specific MM for estimating joint motions. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme significantly outperformed a traditional MM and an MM combined with the classic NMF (NMF-MM), with averaged R and NRMSE equal to 
$$0.89\pm 0.06$$
 and 
$$0.16\pm 0.04$$
 . Further, the similarity between muscle synergies extracted from different training data revealed the proposed method’s effectiveness of identifying consistent control information for MMs. This study provides a novel model-based scheme for the estimation of continuous movements.},

  abstract  = {The application of visual servoing in robot assembly is very promising. In this paper, the 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control based on model predictive control (MPC) is implemented for 3C products assembly. Since the classical IBVS is calculated by multiplying the error times the pseudoinverse of an interaction matrix, it cannot handle constraints. Hence, the collision encountered in the process and the feature points out of the visual range cannot be solved well. Therefore, based on MPC, which can solve the servoing problems by transforming them into constrained optimization, this paper proposes a new MPC for the 3C products assembly system. In the new MPC, we estimate the depth information through image information, to solve the problem of deep collision, and propose a new cost function, which can better solve the problem of the system falling into a local optimal solution. Finally, the simulation verified in the ROS-Gazebo simulation results shows that the new control method is feasible and the control performance is more satisfactory.},

FI replaces the nonlinear error feedback (NLSEF) to improve the adaptive ability in suppressing disturbance, and the FI active disturbance rejection control based on U-model (FI-UADRC) is designed to realize a tracking control with unknown continuous disturbances. The final simulations show that FI-UADRC simplifies the parameter adjustment and maintains good anti-disturbance performance of UADRC, the tracking speed and accuracy under continuous unknown disturbance are better than UADRC.},

One-third of emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) are attributable to LULCC and agricultural activities most especially deforestation. Soil carbon sequestration has been considered as a possible strategy to counterbalance carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions and mitigate global climate change, driven by rising concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere and global increase in temperature. The role of tropical Africa's forests in mitigating climate change has been widely acknowledged under the global treaties' Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) initiatives.

For example, for finding solutions to technical and engineering problems. An alternative for achieving these goals is through knowledge mapping that aims at indexing the knowledge. Recently, we devised an approach called ME-MAP for mapping out know-how, so to facilitate knowledge indexing. However, the challenge of handling large maps still exists. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a simplification mechanism for ME-maps. In particular, we define the meaning of simplification in ME-MAP, set simplification rules, and develop an algorithm for simplifying ME-maps. In addition, we confirm the correctness of the algorithm and its scalability, as well as its support for understanding domain maps through a preliminary user study.},

  abstract  = {Agent-based models (ABM) for policy design need to be grounded in empirical data. While many ABMs rely on quantitative data such as surveys, much empirical research in the social sciences is based on qualitative research methods such as interviews or observations that are hard to translate into a set of quantitative rules, leading to a gap in the phenomena that ABM can explain. As such, there is a lack of a clear methodology to systematically develop ABMs for policy design on the basis of qualitative empirical research. In this paper, a two-stage methodology is proposed that takes an exploratory approach to the development of ABMs in socio-technical systems based on qualitative data. First, a conceptual framework centered on a particular policy design problem is developed based on empirical insights from one or more case studies. Second, the framework is used to guide the development of an ABM. This step is sensitive to the purpose of the model, which can be theoretical or empirical. The proposed methodology is illustrated by an application for disaster information management in Jakarta, resulting in an empirical descriptive ABM.},

  abstract  = {Forest management is an activity of prime economic and ecological importance. Managed forest areas can span very large regions and their proper management is paramount to an effective development, in terms both of economic and natural resources planning. A managed activity consists of individual and mutually independent policy choices which apply to distinct patches of land—named stands—which, as a whole, make up the forest area. A forest management plan typically spans a period of time on the order of a century and is normally geared towards the optimisation of economic or environmental metrics (e.g. total wood yield.) In this article we present a method which uses a declarative programming approach to formalise and solve a long-term forest management problem. We do so based on a freely available state-of-the-art constraint programming system, which we extend to naturally express concepts related to the core problem and efficiently compute solutions thereto.},

Hot cutting and quenching of boron-manganese grades is a solution to meet the part requirements out of geometry, mechanical properties, and surface condition. This approach requires an immediate sequence of austenitization, hot cutting, and quenching and has multiple thermal and mechanical adjustment screws. Hence, the design principles for the thermomechanical cutting process are revealed, which are obtained by a load path-dependent damage simulation. The basis for this is a fracture characterization at elevated temperatures. Building on this, the process and cutting parameters are simulated by variation, and optimal process execution is found. The method is validated on a component that has to satisfy a requirement collective of geometric and mechanical characteristics.},

The solution space afforded through the use of transdisciplinary approach tends to be broader than that achievable with traditional approaches. This expanded solution space is a result of new ways of thinking enabled by exploiting disciplinary convergence. A shift to transdisciplinary systems engineering requires a shift in the approaches and tools needed to engineer complex systems. These changes in systems approaches include models that can capture transdisciplinary concepts, inclusion of expansive meta-data in transdisciplinary models, and application of nontraditional engineering methods to explore concepts and outcomes. As engineering takes on the challenges of increasingly more complex systems with different levels of autonomy, we believe that transdisciplinary approaches will enable the realization of more complete solutions for such systems and enable the complexity necessary for these systems.

  abstract  = {Imperfect manufacturing is one of the factors affecting the performance of antenna systems. It is particularly important when design specifications are strict and leave a minimum leeway for a degradation caused by geometry or material parameter deviations from their nominal values. At the same time, conventional antenna design procedures routinely neglect to take the fabrication tolerances into account, which is mainly a result of a challenging nature of uncertainty quantification. Nevertheless, the ability to assess the effects of parameter deviations and to mitigate thereof is instrumental in achieving truly robust antenna designs. Furthermore, identifying the antenna-specific relationships between nominal requirements and tolerance immunity is essential to determine the necessary levels of fabrication accuracy, which affects the both the reliability and the manufacturing costs. This paper proposes a technique for multi-criterial optimization of antenna structures oriented towards rendering a family of designs representing trade-offs between the nominal performance and the robustness. The fundamental components of our procedure are feature-based regression models constructed at the level of selected characteristics points of the antenna outputs. The trade-off designs are generated sequentially, using local search carried out for gradually relaxed nominal requirements. Numerical experiments conducted for two microstrip antennas demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of yielding the performance/robustness Pareto set at the cost of only a few dozens of EM analysis of the antenna at hand per design, while ensuring reliability, as validated by means of EM-based Monte Carlo simulation.},

Their extension to constrained settings is not trivial as the coarse levels are often not capable of resolving the finest-level constraints sufficiently well, especially if the constraints are oscillatory [13].

First, the mathematical framework is derived, which incorporates the MARG model in a 16-dimensional state space model, then the observations are utilized for 9-dimensional state update in the EKF-framework. For effective state correction the orientation observation, sparse reference position data and virtual measurements are proposed.

The performance of state estimation is evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE) measure. The analysis highlights the impact of sparse reference measurements on the performance of EKF.

  abstract  = {At present, there is no uniform standard for the cost estimation of social security projects for reference, and the cost composition and estimation contents of projects under the self-management mode of all regions are different. In order to do a good job in the basic data collection and information submission for cost estimation, it is necessary to deeply study the cost efficiency of social security projects and realize the high precision assessment thereof. Aiming at the shortcomings of current cost-benefit evaluation model of social security project, such as large error, long time-consuming, low sensitivity to change of inspection value, etc., this paper studies the relevant reference, and puts forward a cost-benefit evaluation model of social security project based on fuzzy entropy. This paper uses analytic hierarchy process to construct the cost-benefit evaluation index system of social security project. By comparing the two indexes, the importance of each index is judged. The final evaluation index is determined according to the consistency test results of the judgment matrix. Combining with the calculation of fuzzy entropy, the indexes are empowered, and the social security project is established by synthesizing the weight of each index, the relevant data of investment budget and project demand. The cost-benefit evaluation model of the project is integrated to realize the benefit evaluation. The experimental results show that the evaluation efficiency of the proposed model is higher, the sensitivity of the model to the changes of the observed values is significantly higher than that of the experimental comparison model, and the evaluation results are closer to the reference values.},

We adopted a qualitative exploratory research approach to assess the readiness of firms (as an individual firm) and the emerging ecosystem in the Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) industry. The maturity model was used to assess the readiness of emerging ecosystem and individual companies. The study identifies 11 critical dimensions in readiness from an emerging ecosystem perspective. We follow a 4-step process 1) Individual companies’ current readiness level, 2) Individual companies’ target level, 3) Emerging ecosystem’s current readiness level, and 4) Emerging ecosystem’s target level. This is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge that studied the emerging ecosystem readiness for the PPO business model.},

  abstract  = {Local authorities managing vulnerable assets require flood risk forecasting tools, customised to respond to their own operational needs. Such tools are even more required in estuaries, where water level prediction is made complex as it depends on riverine flowrates, offshore conditions, astronomical tides, estuarine geometry and atmospheric conditions. In the Gironde estuary, Bordeaux Metropole sewage and rainwater management service includes such an operational tool. To enhance the quality of forecasts for extreme high levels, further hydrodynamics components should be added to this historical forecasting tool. To cope with the lack of environmental inputs in the current tool, first an analysis of how water levels in the estuary can be related to environmental parameters is performed. The sensitivity of the high water level to several inputs parametrisation has been investigated by means of a numerical modelling of the Gironde estuary. The obtained dataset can be considered as a look up table aiming at linking environmental input to high water levels in the estuary. The look up table is then tested against historical flood events. Using reanalysed inputs, it produces levels that matched with the requirements. A comparison with the current operational tool is also performed. Look up table results provided high water levels with a much higher precision.},

  abstract  = {The automotive industry is experiencing a transition from assisted to highly automated driving. New concepts for validation of Automated Driving System (ADS) include amongst other a shift from a “technology based” approach to a “scenario based” assessment. The safety validation and vehicle type approval process of ADS are seen as the biggest challenges for the automotive stakeholders today. Considering a variety of existing white papers, standardization activities and regulatory approaches, manufacturers still struggle with selecting best practices that stay aligned with their Safety Management System and Safety Culture. A step forward would be to implement a harmonized and global safety assurance scheme that is compliant with relevant regulations, standards, and reflects locally accepted behavioural laws. This will ensure a common understanding of the safety and build needed trust around ADS. Today many communities (regulatory bodies, local authorities, industrial stakeholders, and academia) work on proof-of-concept framework for the Safety Argumentation as an answer to this problem. Unfortunately, there is still no consensus on one definitive methodology and a set of safety metrics to measure ADS safety. An objective of this summary paper is to fill existing gaps in the literature reviews, concerning available methods and approaches for engineering frameworks, processes of scenario-based evaluation and a vendor- and technology-neutral Safety Argumentation approaches and tools. A particular focus is placed on safety metrics and emerging quantitative approaches.},

In this context, many researchers have focused their work on the mechanisms of failure of these systems in order to study their reliability, their lifetime and the influence of external factors on them and how well they work. In a response to this wave, a numerical modeling using the Multiphysics finite element method of Ansys Workbench is carried out to study the electro-thermomechanical modeling of the Ball Grid Array (BGA) mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) and attached with the solder joints, which are the main subject of this paper, and the effect of the random vibrations on this system. That is to say that following an electrical excitation (an applied current), the system heats up which causes a thermal gradient and stress due to the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients (CTE) which generates unwanted displacements, strains and mechanical stresses as a final result. This coupled field system is also subjected to random vibrations, which causes, because of a gradual and repeated charge over a long period of time, the system to fail due to the phenomenon of fatigue. These obtained results are shown in this paper and discussed in order to avoid the root of this failure mechanisms.},

A critical analysis of these encounters brings to light several contradictions, asymmetrical relations of power, and other geopolitical issues that discourage the open discussion of large-scale societal issues, due to the controversies and divisiveness that can be found in the intersection between HCI and public policy. In this paper, we explore some of the factors that contribute to this divisiveness, and examine different design practices that have been used in the HCI community for approaching wicked social problems. Then, we present Autonomous Design as a legitimate practice in HCI that tackles these divisive issues, and introduce Punk narratives and aesthetics as a tool for prototyping better futures where multiple worlds co-exist in a relational manner.},

  abstract  = {Compliance has become a widespread topic in industrial robotics in the last decades, both in hardware and in software . In terms of software, virtual compliance is applied widely, mostly the various implementations of impedance control algorithms. Concerning mechanics, series elastic actuators have gained a lot of attention, which are superior to the traditional rigid robotic joints in terms of shock robustness, interaction safety, torque control etc. In this article, one relatively rare case of such system is considered, i.e. a differential-drive robotic joint. This type of joint makes it possible to move the motors out of the joint unit and transmit motion regardless of the configuration of the joint axes. However, this layout leads to strong coupling between input and output joint angles. Introduction of elasticity further complicates the matter, as in general there is coupling in elastic torques as well. Hence, the control system should provide as much decoupling as possible to get satisfactory performance. A mathematical model of this joint has been designed as well as a control system based on elastic structure preserving impedance control. The latter has been verified by simulation in Simulink.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing firms are increasingly adopting Agile approaches for the development of physical products. In combination with advanced production technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM), Agile offers unprecedented opportunities to cope with increasing uncertainties, risks and complexities involved in hardware development operations. Following the case study method, this paper sets out to investigate the implications of combining Agile hardware development (AHD) and AM for the business model of a high-end manufacturer of photography equipment. A comparison of the business model canvas for plan-driven versus Agile development at the case company revealed that the two approaches featured significant differences, which required adaptations in every building block of the canvas. This study’s implications are threefold. First, this study empirically examines the potential of AHD approaches and highlights that the adoption of AHD engages with virtually all organizational functions of a manufacturing firm. Thus, AHD calls for holistic approaches during implementation. Second, this study shows that regular product take-backs are required to account for product iterations becoming frequently outdated. This result implies a closed-loop manufacturing system for operations and supply chain management. Third, this paper discusses strategies for both product design and product take-back processes, which could further enhance companies’ AHD operations.},

  abstract  = {Finite element model updating is a technique to improve the analytical or simulated finite element (FE) model of any structure from its experimental modal test data. The main purpose to apply finite model updating (FEMU) on structures is to remove the uncertainties present in the finite element model. In this paper, finite element model updating method is applied on the composite structure to remove the error present in the finite element models. The main objective of this paper is to accurately estimate the modal analysis characteristics such as the spatial model, modal –model, and the response model of the composite structure laminates. The uncertainties present in the analytical or simulated finite element model of any composite structure may be due to its in-plane elastic properties, fiber orientations, and incorrect dimensions and most probably due to the uncertainty present in the boundary conditions of the structure. In this paper, direct updating method has been used to improve the finite element model of the composite structure laminate. A graphite–epoxy composite material laminate is taken for the validation of direct updating method. It will be observed from the proposed study that direct updating method is fast and easy to implement because it directly updates the simulated finite element model by removing the uncertainties.},

Taking advantage of this, we connected a real-time version of an EMG-driven model to a bilateral ankle exoskeleton to continuously assist during a wide repertory of locomotion tasks. The advantage is that the user controls the exoskeleton voluntarily, i.e. as a direct function of own muscle force. As a result, the developed framework can seamlessly assist in different tasks as well as transitions between tasks without having to change any parameters or using an additional algorithm to switch between states. Results on three participants show that an exoskeleton controlled via this framework reduces EMGs during locomotion tasks with various speeds and/or inclinations. This is the first step toward creating controller allowing to assist in tasks independent manner.},

  abstract  = {Scaling bugs – errors that only manifest at large scale simulations, in terms of number of parallel workers or input size – are critical to detect early in the testing of HPC codes. If missed, these bugs can cause applications to either crash at runtime during production runs or, even worse, silently continue and corrupt results. This results in wasting vast amounts of resources and the crash might not provide any useful debugging information. Laguna et al. presented a method for solving this in [ 13 ] using an approach where scale variables are traced throughout an application statically and potentially overflowing instructions are detected, with further refinements done by running a few small scale experiments. However, their algorithm is not able to trace multiple code patterns found in production HPC applications, for example code modularity, and has not been applied to Fortran applications. We present an extension to their algorithm which addresses these issues thus enabling us to find scaling bugs in complex real applications where they could not be found before. The key features that enable this are backward/forward tracing and optimistic GEP comparison.},

As data center networks have grown in popularity, efficient routing has become a critical problem for maximizing network performance, scalability, and reliability. Traditional link-state algorithms are widely used in data center networks, but they take a longer convergence time. In DCN, topology-aware routing algorithms were recently discovered to be efficient. This paper proposes the ant colony-based shortest path routing algorithm (AC*) to illustrate typical topologies. To guarantee unified control of the whole network, this approach decouples the control plane from the data forwarding plane, and topology description language (TPDL) files are utilized as prerequisite information to establish initial topology in the software-defined network (SDN) controllers. Unlike other topology-aware routing algorithms, the ant colony-based shortest path routing algorithm (AC*) is designed to work on a variety of standard topologies. The AC* algorithm outperforms traditional link-state routing methods according to the results of the experiments.},

The aggregation of all the allowable ranges formulates the allowable standard.

This paper proposes a novel approach for the modeling and quantitative reliability analysis of redundancy architectures based on the SBIP framework. Our approach supports modeling the nominal system behavior and the system faults in a unified formal model, which can be further integrated into the rigorous component-based system design paradigm advocated by BIP. We also propose two categories of metrics for formal reliability evaluation of redundancy architectures in terms of whether the system can operate correctly or provide reduced functionalities in the presence of faults. We take a computation unit as the running example and apply the proposed approach to analyze static redundancy and dynamic redundancy, which are Triple Module Redundancy architecture and Cold Standby architecture respectively. The experimental results show that our approach can accurately model various redundancy architectures and provide a comprehensive analysis of reliability and related properties in an automated manner. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to a wide range of fault types and behaviors.},

  abstract  = {In aging society, a number of individuals cannot perform normal daily activities because they have not enough physical strength. Elderly people, which have low mobility and do not stay at hospital, can perform daily activity only with the aid of caregivers. Although the recent pandemic situation has drastically modified global scenarios, even in this new and challenging situation, there is the need of developing suitable solutions for increasing the autonomy of fragile people in daily – life activities that can be performed at home. The new concept of Cyber Physical- Systems (CPS), which has been introduced mainly in the industrial context, pervades new domains, such as manufacturing, transportation, medical, military, and many others. This paper deals with the use of a CPS for a STS (Sit-To-Stand) device, which serves for an essential operation consisting in the movement for transitioning from sitting to standing postures. We have focused the attention on that specific task because it is crucial for daily-life and has clinical significance, since higher STS movement ability may enhance the quality of life.},

Both require meeting individual privacy requirements and thus, privacy protection that can be customized. We introduce a synchronized Digital Twin (DT) approach suggesting that sharing autonomy of heterogeneous and dynamically evolving system components helps to increase transparency and ultimately user control of privacy concerns. The proposed architecture is based on behavior models for integrated design and engineering of CPS. The executable and federated nature of the DT approach enables a user-centered system validation of privacy management capabilities, both for organizations, and individuals. The resulting reduction of complexity is exemplified for an Internet-of-Things-based application in the logistics domain. We explore some implications of the presented approach for future research, practice, and development.},

Nowadays, some museums also undertake the roles as learning center, communication and social place, leisure center, and cultural communication center, by offering comprehensive experience of multisensory feelings, intelligence, aesthetics, social communication. As active participators and operators in virtual environment, the visitors show stronger engagement and better use experience when using virtual reality applications. A good interactive design in the virtual museum system will enhance the quality of remediation, which will encourage users to be active and immersed in the virtual tour. This study aims to analyze the interaction design of the virtual Palace Museum and examine virtual experience designed for visitors. After analyzed the virtual applications of the Palace Museum, we found that virtual museums can deliver knowledge in an attractive and accessible way for better cultural experience. Virtual reality is not to replace the unique experience of appreciating real objects, but it can greatly improve our understanding of artifacts and allow us to better understand their stories. The virtual museum enables immersive sense, good storytelling, interactive learning, and sharing between peers, which turns passive visitors to active explorers. In the digital age and the epidemic, we must re-examine the positioning and mission of museums from a longer-term perspective, dig and interpret the diverse values of cultural heritage, and give new vitality to cultural heritage.},

Firstly, according to the overall technical specification of the system, the radio broadcast communication scenario is designed and improved in detail. Then, the radio broadcast communication scenario is described by SysML language, the TCPN model of the scenario is established based on SysML model. The accessibility, boundedness, liveness, fairness and home behavior of the model are verified, and the rationality of the scenario design and the rationality and feasibility of the radio broadcast communication mode of this system are proved. In this paper, the modeling and verification of the radio broadcast communication scenario can provide a reference for the design and development of this system.},

Rainy images can be treated as an arbitrary combination of these components, some of them or all of them. How to decompose superimposed images, like rainy images, into distinct source components is a crucial step toward real-world vision systems. To facilitate research on this new task, we construct multiple benchmark datasets, including mixed image decomposition across multiple domains, real-scenario deraining, and joint shadow/reflection/watermark removal. Moreover, we propose a simple yet general B lind I mage De composition N etwork (BIDeN) to serve as a strong baseline for future work. Experimental results demonstrate the tenability of our benchmarks and the effectiveness of BIDeN. Codes and datasets are available at GitHub .},

We formulate the problem using a mixed-integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing the total travel distance while ensuring the workload balance among depots. Then, on small-scale instances, we also conduct several experiments to validate the model and to investigate how using multiple depots affects warehouse performance in terms of total travel distance. The results show that multi-depot order picking systems outperform single-depot systems in saving the total travel distance, and the performance can be enhanced by properly defining depot locations.},

To verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed DPC-SVM with MRAS, the whole system was tested under a variable wind speed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.

In this paper, we formally define the rr language and its semantics, detailing the initial definition from [ 8 ] and extending it with a notion of constraints that allows to model mandatory events. Then, we consider in turn two classes of Petri nets: priority Petri nets ( ppn ), which are safe place/transition Petri nets equipped with transitions priorities, and extended Petri nets ( epn ) which are ppn further extended with read arcs, inhibitor arcs, and reset arcs. For each of these classes, we define the translation of an rr system into a Petri net and prove that the state-space generated with the rr operational semantics is equivalent to the marking graph of the Petri net resulting from the translation. We use a very strong notion of equivalence by considering labelled transition systems ( lts ) isomophism with states and labels matching.},

  abstract  = {Paper-based microfluidics has grown continuously over the last few years. One of the most important characteristics of paper-based microfluidic devices is the ability to pump fluids with the single action of capillary forces. However, fluid flow control in paper-based microfluidic devices has been studied primarily through empirical approaches; and as paper-based microfluidic devices have become more complex, more general and precise models of fluid flow are required. Particularly difficult to model are unsaturated flow conditions, which are critical to the overall performance of paper-based analytical devices, which may contain pre-adsorbed reagents such as indicator particles or antibodies. In this work we propose an objective test and a discussion on the suitability of different models (including a novel model derived here from LET-based models) that represent fluid imbibition dynamics in paper substrates. We reproduce experimental fluid fronts with the best parameter fits of the different models to show their actual capabilities to represent the moisture content function and present an analysis of propagation of uncertainties to obtain a final objective quantification of the quality of model fits. This objective analysis will endow the paper-based microfluidics community with objective information about modeling tools to improve the designs and performance of these devices.},

  abstract  = {Schema-free (flexible schema) is an attractive feature in the NoSQL document store, where users can access the database without referring to its schema. It reduces the stress of developers to design database schema and applications. Data modeling is defined as arranging application data using acceptable data structuring patterns and is the primary component of the schema design in the document store. In addition, studies have continued examining NoSQL’s energy consumption pattern. But, our recent survey does not observe any energy-efficienct analysis for NoSQL schema. This work therefore designs alternative schemes using a particular combination of document store structuring patterns and analyzes storage criteria for everything. In NoSQL, the use of indexing and application-level joints is widely adopted. This article also compares performance and energy requirements for query processing with/without indexing, and application-level join operations and also helps to design query optimization.},

Remote sensing image has high spatial resolution, wide data source and fast update, which is conducive to the establishment of large-scale inversion of heavy metal content in soil spatial dynamic analysis. In this paper, we take Gangkou Town of Yueyang County and Dapu Town of Hengdong County as the research area, using Landsat8 data and Sentinel-2 image data as the data sources, and using the pixel linear unmixing model to extract the pure soil spectra in the image mixing end members, respectively Perform different spectral transformations on the two data sources, and compare the correlation between the original image spectrum and the decomposed soil spectrum and heavy metals. The research results show that whether it is for Landsat8 image data or Sentinel-2 image data, the number of bands that pass the sig < 0.05 two-sided correlation test after spectral linear decomposition is greater than before unmixing, and pass sig < 0.01 two-sided correlation The number of bands for sex testing has also increased, indicating that the spectral response of the soil spectrum and heavy metal Cr extracted through pixel decomposition has been effectively improved, and the spectral information has been enhanced.},

The effect of temperature is also included during the verification process. A cost-effective battery test bench is developed based on the presented test methodology and details of the test bench configuration are discussed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed test approach, a battery that supports the operation of a 6 kW integrated starter and generator is tested using the proposed approach. The effect of temperature is also studied by both simulation and experiments. The considered testing approach is expected to benefit battery suppliers by enabling the cost-effective verification of a battery performance. As the proposed approach includes the effect of drive cycles and temperature, furthermore, a comprehensive and realistic testing that focuses on the battery performance can be performed.},

An elaborate numerical analysis is implemented to discuss the spatial and temporal deformation features, and then, the deformation and failure mechanism has also been revealed. Results indicate that the deformation is time-dependent in a ladder form with the excavation process, and the deformation of rock mass is affected severely by the excavation of the corresponding and the following layers. Besides, the deformation values descend with the monitoring depth increasing. The excavation disturbed area enlarges with the unloading process, and the deformation at the corresponding position keeps deteriorating until new stability.

  abstract  = {The Taihang Mountains in North China are an important carbon-water ecosystem service supply area. Understanding the coupling effect and influencing mechanisms of mountain carbon sequestration as well as water conservation is essential for regional ecological restoration and sustainable development. In this study, we utilized models such as the coupled coordination degree model, the random forest and Geodetector to analyze the spatio-temporal changes as well as driving factors of carbon sequestration-water conservation coupling coordination in the Taihang Mountains. The results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the carbon sequestration and water conservation capacity of the Taihang Mountains exhibited a spatial pattern with higher values in the southeast and central regions, while lower values in the northwest region. (2) The average coupling coordination degree from 1990 to 2020 was 0.23, which was overall low, with a fluctuating decreasing-rising-decreasing trend over time. The coupling coordination degree exhibited a pattern that is high in the middle and low in the periphery, with a fluctuating distribution that initially decreases and then increases with the increasing altitude. The overall trend of coupling coordination is degradation, with concentrated degradation in the northwest mountainous regions. (3) Precipitation and soil texture were identified as the main driving factors influencing coupling coordination, with the interaction between precipitation and soil sand content showing the strongest explanatory power, while that among topography, vegetation and human activities had relatively low explanatory power. Therefore, enhanced protection and the continuous monitoring of vegetation and soil environments in the Taihang Mountains are essential, with particular emphasis on ecological restoration in areas experiencing a persistent degradation of carbon-water coupling. This study can provide assistance in monitoring and managing carbon sink and water resources in the mountains, meanwhile mitigating potential adverse impacts on human well-being.},

Within a 3-week lead time, ice persistence is the primary source of predictability. Beyond this period, ENSO becomes a key source of Antarctic sea ice predictability, with El Niño enhancing ice linear predictability more than La Niña.

  abstract  = {Some of the most important considerations when undertaking dynamical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) using regional climate models are the choice of model physical parameterisations, the use of spectral nudging, and whether to bias correct the driving GCMs prior to downscaling. While each of these factors have been extensively examined, very few studies have compared the effect of all 3 on model biases against independent observations during the historical period, as well as the change in future climate. We carry out this analysis and focus on the CORDEX-Australasia domain with all simulations driven using a common GCM. We found that the choice of model parameterisaton schemes had by far the largest influence on model biases and the change in climate, especially for precipitation during summer. While bias correction reduced large systematic biases for some variables in some regions, it also increased biases elsewhere, and results were not consistent for all variables. Our results show that it is important to first assess the performance of non-corrected GCM-driven simulations against the reference re-analysis driven simulations, as bias correction may not be necessary if the GCM-driven simulation already performs well compared to the reference simulation. Spectral nudging had a limited influence on both model biases and the change in climate, except for summer precipitation in the tropics. While we only use a single RCM and a single GCM, our key finding is that given limited computational and data resources, regional climate modelling groups should prioritize a multi-physics ensemble of the RCM to better account for internal physics-driven variability, over the use of bias-correction or spectral nudging.},

  abstract  = {This study addresses a fundamental challenge in digital advertising: how performance-focused campaigns, traditionally aimed at lower-funnel activity, may influence brand awareness. With the growth of online advertising, businesses increasingly rely on performance campaigns across social media, search engine marketing and display networks to drive results. However, a notable phenomenon has emerged. Businesses may observe substantial branded search activity, suggesting lower-funnel campaigns could indirectly shape brand awareness. To investigate this relationship, data were analysed from an e-commerce business operating in five European countries with an annual multimillion-euro lower-funnel budget. We employed a ridge regression model with adstock values to account for temporal advertising effects and address common challenges of multicollinearity in multichannel analysis. Our analysis reveals that lower-funnel campaigns significantly drive branded search activity, suggesting they play an unacknowledged role in building brand awareness. The incorporation of adstock values into ridge regression improves model performance, increasing the R ^2 from 0.658 to 0.768 and lowering root mean square. This approach stabilizes residual variance and provides a more accurate representation of advertising’s fading effects over time. These findings offer a replicable framework for practitioners to measure the indirect branding effects of performance campaigns and optimise cross-channel investments.},

  abstract  = {Visual grounding is a fundamental task that bridges vision and language, aiming to accurately associate natural language queries with specific regions in an image. Existing approaches, predominantly based on Transformers or CNNs, struggle with balancing computational efficiency and fine-grained semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose RWKV-VG, the first visual grounding framework entirely built on the RWKV architecture. Leveraging RWKV’s unique ability to combine RNN-like sequential modeling with Transformer-like attention, our model efficiently achieves both intra-modal and cross-modal reasoning. The framework consists of a RWKV-based visual encoder, a RWKV-based linguistic encoder, and a RWKV-based visual-linguistic decoder, complemented by a learnable [REG] token designed for box regression. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ReferItGame and the RefCOCO series, demonstrate the superiority of RWKV-VG, achieving state-of-the-art performance with rapid convergence. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the RWKV modules and the [REG] token design. Our work establishes RWKV as a compelling alternative to conventional architectures for visual grounding tasks. To facilitate future research, the code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/nianfd/RWKV-VG .},

Teleosts often exhibit rapid turnover of SCs and sex-determining (SD) genes, alongside a diverse range of SC differentiation mechanisms. Results On the basis of new chromosome-scale assemblies of three Silurus species ( S. microdorsalis , S . glanis , and S. lanzhouensis ) and two outgroup species ( Pterocryptis cochinchinensis and Kryptopterus bicirrhis ), along with our previous assemblies of S. meridionalis and S . asotus , we traced the evolution of SC in the Silurus genus (Siluriformes), following the fate of the known SD gene amhr2y . Phylogenetic analysis showed that a mhr2y occurred at least before the divergence of Pterocryptis , Kryptopterus , and Silurus and lost in P. cochinchinensis and K. bicirrhis . Chr24 has become the SC in the ancestor of five Silurus species due to the duplication-and-translocation of amhr2 mediated by LTR transposon. Then, a proto Y was formed and maintained with a shared 60 kb male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) by transposable elements (TEs) expansion and gene gathering . Due to the continuous TEs accumulation, genes other than amhr2y in MSYs have degenerated or been lost, while non-recombinant regions continue to expend, forming MSYs of different sizes in different Silurus species (from 320 to 550 kb). Two turnover events, one homologous (from the left arm to the right arm of Chr24) and one nonhomologous (from Chr24 to Chr5), occurring among five Silurus species were possibly mediated by hAT and Helitron transposons. Conclusions Our results on the dynamic evolutionary trajectory of SD gene amhr2y , MSYs, and SCs in Silurus catfish indicated the variability and diversity of fish SCs and confirmed that frequent turnover is an important way to maintain the homology and low differentiation of fish SCs.},

  abstract  = {The increasing incidence of fires has resulted in a growing number of casualties and economic losses. On the one hand, traditional firefighting approaches and equipment are inefficient and expose firefighters to great danger. On the other hand, in recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gradually being applied in firefighting fields such as fire detection and extinguishing due to their safety, flexibility, and low cost. The performance of the firefighting UAV has a significant impact on its efficiency in performing their tasks. To calculate the performance quantitatively, support vector regression (SVR) is employed to establish the performance prediction model. However, it is difficult to set SVR parameters efficiently because of the high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and complexity in this problem, which restricts the prediction effect. Therefore, the mutant shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA) based SVR method is proposed to optimize SVR parameters and predict the performance of the UAV. First, the step size equation is modified in MSFLA, which expands the search range in the iterations and can help to find better solutions. Meanwhile, considering that traditional optimization algorithms are prone to falling into local optimums, the Cauchy mutation is introduced into the position update process of the proposed MSFLA to overcome this shortcoming. The mutation strategy improves the global optimization capabilities. Finally, the performance prediction based on the proposed methods are simulated. The simulations focus on comparing the prediction errors of the different methods on the testing set. The average predicted errors and four commonly used assessment indicators are calculated, and the corresponding results suggest that the prediction effectiveness of MSFLA-SVR is much better than the other methods. Moreover, the results of statistical test further demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract  = {Based on previous in vitro experiments with specimens of porcine mandibular premolars, the simulation of the periodontal ligament response to force in the initial phase of orthodontic tooth movement is described. The initial response of the periodontal ligament can be simulated with a poro-visco-hyperelastic model. For the ground substance a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible material was used. To facilitate parameter identification a reduced order model and an optimal interpolation metamodel were used. Parameters for the constitutive model identified herein are in good agreement with published values. They indicate a high initial compressibility of the periodontal ligament, which may be attributed to the compressibility of the vascular system within the periodontal ligament. Dimensionless analysis suggests that poroelastic behaviour will gradually cease when viscoelastic relaxation progresses. This was observed as well in the simulation and confirmed by varying the poroelastic model parameters within physically justified limits. Alveolar bone permeability has a significant influence on the flow of pore fluid in the periodontium due to poroelasticity. It is argued that in vivo alveolar bone perforation may adapt locally to optimise for the predominant load situation. A strain rate hardening effect was observed, which is not covered by the simulation, and may be the subject of further investigations.},

  abstract  = {The mTORC1 pathway is essential for increased energy requirements of proliferating cancer cells, but its upstream regulation remains elusive. This study reports neddylation of lysosomal small GTPase RHEB as control mechanism for mTORC1 activation, autophagy suppression, and hepatic malignancy. Depletion of NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F suppresses cell growth and induces autophagy in liver cancer cells. UBE2F depletion inactivates mTORC1 activity in a RHEB-dependent manner. UBE2F cooperates with E3 ligase SAG in RHEB neddylation, increasing its lysosome localization and GTP-binding activity. UBE2F depletion inhibits liver steatosis and tumorigenesis in mouse models. High UBE2F expression levels and mTORC1 activity correlate with worse prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. NEDD8 conjugation of lysosomal small GTPase RHEB controls mTORC1 activity, autophagy and hepatic cancer progression. Small GTPase RHEB is a well-known mTORC1 activator, whereas neddylation modifies cullins and non-cullin substrates to regulate their activity, subcellular localization and stability. Whether and how RHEB is subjected to neddylation modification remains unknown. Here, we report that RHEB is a substrate of NEDD8-conjugating E2 enzyme UBE2F. In cell culture, UBE2F depletion inactivates mTORC1, inhibiting cell cycle progression, cell growth and inducing autophagy. Mechanistically, UBE2F cooperates with E3 ligase SAG in neddylation of RHEB at K169 to enhance its lysosome localization and GTP-binding affinity. Furthermore, liver-specific Ube2f knockout attenuates steatosis and tumorigenesis induced by Pten loss in an mTORC1-dependent manner, suggesting a causal role of UBE2F in liver tumorigenesis. Finally, UBE2F expression levels and mTORC1 activity correlate with patient survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, our study identifies RHEB as neddylation substrate of the UBE2F-SAG axis, and highlights the UBE2F-SAG axis as a potential target for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.},

Cells in quiescence can survive for a short or long term in silence, may undergo genetic or epigenetic changes, and can initiate relapse through certain contextual cues. The state of dormancy can be induced by multiple conditions including cancer drug treatment, in turn, undergoes a life cycle that generally occurs through dissemination, invasion, intravasation, circulation, immune evasion, extravasation, and colonization. Throughout this cascade, a cellular machinery governs the fate of individual cells, largely affected by gene regulation. Despite its significance, a precise view of cancer dormancy is yet hampered. Revolutionizing advanced single cell and long read sequencing through analysis methodologies and artificial intelligence, the most recent stage in the research tool progress, is expected to provide a holistic view of the diverse aspects of cancer dormancy.},

  abstract  = {Observations of the Phoenix cluster using the James Webb Space Telescope reveal rapid cooling in galaxy cluster cores, driven by black hole jets, with gas temperatures mapped between 10^5 K and 10^6 K and cooling rates of 5,000–23,000  M _⊙ yr^−1. In the centres of many galaxy clusters, the hot (approximately 10^7 kelvin) intracluster medium can become dense enough that it should cool on short timescales^ 1 , 2 . However, the low measured star formation rates in massive central galaxies^ 3 – 6 and the absence of soft X-ray lines from the cooling gas^ 7 – 9 suggest that most of this gas never cools. This is known as the cooling flow problem. The latest observations suggest that black hole jets are maintaining the vast majority of gas at high temperatures^ 10 – 16 . A cooling flow has yet to be fully mapped through all the gas phases in any galaxy cluster. Here we present observations of the Phoenix cluster^ 17 using the James Webb Space Telescope to map the [Ne vi ] λ 7.652-μm emission line, enabling us to probe the gas at 10^5.5 kelvin on large scales. These data show extended [Ne vi ] emission that is cospatial with the cooling peak in the intracluster medium, the coolest gas phases and the sites of active star formation. Taken together, these imply a recent episode of rapid cooling, causing a short-lived spike in the cooling rate, which we estimate to be 5,000–23,000 solar masses per year. These data provide a large-scale map of gas at temperatures between 10^5 kelvin and 10^6 kelvin in a cluster core, and highlight the critical role that black hole feedback has in not only regulating cooling but also promoting it^ 18 .},

  abstract  = {The production of industrial enzymes requires an efficient expression system with a suitable host. This study investigated the isolated Bacillus subtilis 007 as a host for expressing three enzymes with potential application in the food industry. Firstly, testing the P_aprE and P_43 promoters and the corresponding 5’ untranslated regions revealed great differences in the production of the recently discovered β-galactosidase from Paenibacillus wnnyii . Expression controlled by the P_aprE promoter yielded a significantly higher activity of 2515 µkat/L, compared to 56 µkat/L with the P_43 promoter. Modifications on the P_aprE core promoter region or the spacer, the sequence between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon, did not improve β-galactosidase production. Since the aprE 5’ untranslated region contributes to a high mRNA stability, it was incorporated into the P_43 construct to determine whether mRNA stability is responsible for the differences observed in β-galactosidase production. Interestingly, mRNA stability was significantly improved and led to a nearly 50-fold higher β-galactosidase production of 2756 µkat/L. This strategy was successfully validated by the expression of two other enzymes: the cellobiose-2-epimerase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and the β-glucosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus . These findings underscored the crucial role of post-transcriptional regulation and emphasized mRNA stability as a key role in recombinant enzyme production in B. subtilis 007.},

Typically, clinical diagnosis using radiology images involves disease reporting and classification, where the former is a multimodal task whereby textual reports are generated to describe clinical findings in images, as are common in various domains, e.g., chest X-ray or computed tomography. Existing approaches are mainly supervised, the quality of which heavily depends on the volume and quality of available labeled data. However, for rarer or more novel diseases, enrolling patients to collect data is both time-consuming and expensive. For non-English languages, sufficient quantities of labeled data are typically not available. We propose the Multimodal Multidomain Multilingual Foundation Model. It is useful for rare diseases and non-English languages, where the labeled data are frequently much more scarce, and may even be absent. Our approach achieves encouraging performances on nine datasets, including 2 infectious and 14 non-infectious diseases.},

Methods The hybrid coordinate dual screw in this paper is developed based on the dual number representation of a rigid body. We firstly provided a general six-dimensions screw form of vectors and matrices that can directly match the mechanical engineering parameters of a rigid body, to replace the currently three-dimensional dual form. On this basis, the representation and operation of six-dimensional dual screws are extended to n-dimensional space to describe vibration of a flexible body. Hybrid coordinate system is used to establishing a cross dimensional coupling function between n-dimensional vibration and six-dimensional attitude-orbit spiral motion. Specifically, two parameters, dual modes and dual coupling coefficients, are defined in hybrid coordinate dual screw. Results The general dynamic model for the rigid-flexible multibodies is developed based on the small deformation hypothesis, assumption of constant center of mass, and assumption of configuration stability. Conclusion The general dynamic model proposed in this paper can describe the motion envelope of rigid-flexible multibodies for close range relative missions with safety requirements, such as space debris capture, on-orbit services.},

We utilised Radial Basis Functions to predict the oceanauts’ cognitive performance and investigated the impact of mental workload, personal characteristics, and comfort on their cognitive performance. The findings indicated that establishing an appropriate level of mental workload for the visual, auditory, cognitive, and psychomotor channels can enhance the oceanaut’s cognitive performance of individuals engaged in ocean exploration. It is worth noting that the optimal values for mental workload vary across these channels. Furthermore, the presence of suitable comfort, appropriate age, and a relatively higher level of educational background contribute to the enhancement of cognitive performance among oceanauts.},

  abstract  = {Accurate phonon-limited transport methodologies are crucial for predicting material performance, as electron–phonon interactions impact key properties such as mobility, Hall factor and thermoelectric efficiency. The main approaches for phonon-limited transport modelling are the Boltzmann transport equation, Kubo formalism and Landauer–Büttiker approach, each suited to specific transport conditions and system scales. These first-principles methods enable accurate calculations of electronic transport properties without relying on empirical parameters, allowing the prediction of new materials. Transport behaviour can become particularly complex in certain regimes involving, for example, non-equilibrium phonons, high electric fields, low dimensionality or spin–orbit coupling effects, each introducing their own specificities. A better understanding of electronic transport in semiconductors is essential for both fundamental and applied physics, as it directly affects key material properties such as the conductivity and thermoelectric quantities. This Technical Review explores different frameworks and computational tools available for computing these properties of semiconductors. Understanding electronic transport in materials is essential to both fundamental and applied physics, as it directly influences critical properties such as the mobility of semiconductors and the efficiency of thermoelectric materials. Electron transport hinges on electronic structure of a material and various scattering events. Among these, scattering by phonons stands out as one of the most fundamental mechanisms, as it occurs even in pristine single crystals. But only recently have advances in the development of accurate first-principles methods allowed the precise calculation of electronic transport properties entirely from first principles, without relying on experimental parameters. This Technical Review presents the underlying physics of phonon-limited linear transport, primarily within the framework of the Boltzmann transport formalism but also for alternative approaches, such as the Landauer–Büttiker and Kubo frameworks. In addition, this Review covers technical aspects of implementing these formalisms, including their limitations and the scope of their applicability. Finally, we will discuss some specific transport regimes, such as transport in a strong electric field or involving the effect of spin–orbit coupling.},

  abstract  = {Locally distributed processes include several process participants working on tasks at different locations, e.g., craftspeople working on construction sites. Compared to classical IT environments, new challenges emerge due to the spatial context of a process. Real-time location data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can help businesses implement more efficient and effective processes through business process management (BPM). However, only small parts of existing research have touched on those advantages, while the architecture and implementation of actual executable location-aware processes area has only been vaguely considered. Therefore, we introduce and present a non-exhaustive list of patterns for using location data in BPM while also including an actual implementation of a location-aware approach using a multilayer system architecture based on standard BPM technology. These can be used to leverage the location perspective of process entities as contextual data in BPM.},

  abstract  = {To enable artificial agents to generate human-like goals, a model must capture the complexity and diversity of human goals. Davidson et al. model playful goals from a naturalistic experiment as reward-producing programs, mapping an agent’s behaviour to goal success. They then develop a computational model to generate diverse human-like goals. People are remarkably capable of generating their own goals, beginning with child’s play and continuing into adulthood. Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals and goal-oriented behaviour, models are still far from capturing the richness of everyday human goals. Here we bridge this gap by collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals (in the form of scorable, single-player games), modelling them as reward-producing programs and generating novel human-like goals through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose, add temporal constraints and allow program execution on behavioural traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative model of goals, we learn a fitness function over the infinite set of possible goal programs and sample novel goals with a quality-diversity algorithm. Human evaluators found that model-generated goals, when sampled from partitions of program space occupied by human examples, were indistinguishable from human-created games. We also discovered that our model’s internal fitness scores predict games that are evaluated as more fun to play and more human-like.},

  abstract  = {The goal of our research was to design a methodology for extracting systematized knowledge from free speech. The sources of knowledge in our analysis were records of production meetings, focused on production disturbance (PD). The main obstacle is to properly identify the specific meaning of words, in a specific, usually narrow, industry. Machine learning based on data from production records has been increasingly used to build such models. In the case of manufacturing plants with diverse production programs, acquiring the right number and structure of data is not possible; hence, proper identification of such terms is for classical NLP tools, even supported by large language models, not possible. We have attempted to use AI and NLP tools from recorded production meeting recordings to create and continuously update PD’s knowledge as a supplement to data from documentation. This is an approach not previously known in the field of production management. The solution we developed consists of an expert-defined specific ontology, based on the pre-processed speeches. At this stage, a lexicon (vocabulary) is also created, supporting the transformation of the speeches into interpretable texts. The model ontology formulated this way is then used to analyze consecutively provided meeting records and thus update the operational ontology. In our research, we used the materials provided to us in the form of records of production meetings from a medium-sized pressure foundry. The obtained results confirm that the adopted knowledge model and the algorithms might be successfully utilized to solve real-world manufacturing problems.},

Mechanical properties degradation is used as macroscopic indicator. Changes in structure and morphology assessed by FTIR and XRD are used as microscopic indicators. Both microscopic and macroscopic indicators have confirmed that aging under higher temperatures affect dramatically XLPE behavior. Mechanical properties declining are due to a thermo-oxidation process caused by the antioxidant consumption. Besides, an important increase of carbonyl index is also caused by this thermo-oxidation degradation at microscopic scale. The drastic deterioration of the material was noticed after 2000 h of aging at 110 °C and 135 °C. This aging time can be taken as a critical time between two underwent different aging processes. Moreover, the mechanical properties evolutions are used to determine the thermal endurance and the temperature index (IT) of the material by using the Arrhenius formulation. Finally, a cross-correlation assessment between macroscopic and microscopic results was given in the end of this paper.},

  abstract  = {The Amazon forest is fire sensitive, but, where fires were uncommon as a natural disturbance, deforestation and drought are accelerating fire occurrences, which threaten the integrity of the tropical forest, the carbon cycle and air quality. Fire emissions depend on fuel amount and type, moisture conditions and burning behaviour. Higher-resolution satellite data have helped more accurately map global burnt areas; however, the effects of fuels on the combustion process and on the composition of fire emissions remain uncertain in current fire emissions inventories. By using multiple Earth observation-based approaches, here we show that total fire emissions in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are dominated by smouldering combustion of woody debris. The representation of woody debris and surface litter presents a critical uncertainty in fire emissions inventories and global vegetation models. For the fire season 1 August to 31 October 2020, for which all approaches are available, we found 
$$372^{605}_{277}\,\mathrm{Tg}$$

The findings enable diagnosing the representation of fuels, wildfire combustion and its effects on atmospheric composition and the carbon cycle in global vegetation–fire models. Fire emissions in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are mainly produced from smouldering combustion of woody debris, according to observationally constrained fire emissions inventories.},

We recruited a total of 220 healthy volunteers from the Shanghai Pudong Cohort (NCT05206643), spanning 13 age groups from 0 to over 90 years, and profiled their peripheral immune cells through single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with single T cell and B cell receptor sequencing, high-throughput mass cytometry, bulk RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry validation experiments. We revealed that T cells were the most strongly affected by age and experienced the most intensive rewiring in cell–cell interactions during specific age. Different T cell subsets displayed different aging patterns in both transcriptomes and immune repertoires; examples included GNLY^+CD8^+ effector memory T cells, which exhibited the highest clonal expansion among all T cell subsets and displayed distinct functional signatures in children and the elderly; and CD8^+ MAIT cells, which reached their peaks of relative abundance, clonal diversity and antibacterial capability in adolescents and then gradually tapered off. Interestingly, we identified and experimentally verified a previously unrecognized ‘cytotoxic’ B cell subset that was enriched in children. Finally, an immune age prediction model was developed based on lifecycle-wide single-cell data that can evaluate the immune status of healthy individuals and identify those with disturbed immune functions. Our work provides both valuable insights and resources for further understanding the aging of the immune system across the whole human lifespan. In this Resource, authors profile peripheral immune cells from a total of 220 healthy volunteers from birth to over 90 years. This revealed that T cells were most affected by aging with divergent aging patterns in different subsets and identified a population of cytotoxic B cells that were enriched in children.},

  abstract  = {Family-based behavioral models capture the behavior of a software product line (SPL) in a single model, incorporating the variability among the products. In representing these models, a common technique is to annotate well-known behavioral modeling notations with features, e.g., featured finite state machine (FFSM) as an extension to the well-known finite state machine notation. It is not always the case that family-based behavioral models are prepared before developing an SPL, or kept up-to-date during the development and maintenance. Model learning is helpful in such situations. Taking advantage of the commonality among the SPL products, it is possible to reuse the product models in learning the behavior of the entire SPL. In this paper, the process of constructing FFSM models for SPLs is enhanced. Model learning is performed using an adaptive learning algorithm called PL*. Regarding the model learning step, we introduce a new heuristic method for determining the product learning orders with high learning efficiency. The proposed heuristic takes into account the complexity of features added by each product and improves the previous heuristics for learning order. To construct the whole family-based behavioral model of an SPL, the behavioral models of individual products are iteratively merged into the whole family-based model. A similarity metric is used to determine which states of the two models are merged with each other. By providing a formalization for the existing FFSM_Diff algorithm for this purpose, we prove that in the FFSM constructed by this algorithm, the choice of the similarity metric does not affect the observable behavior of the constructed FFSM. We study the efficiency of three similarity metrics, two of which are local metrics, in the sense that they determine the similarity of two states only in terms of their adjacent transitions. On the other hand, a global similarity metric takes into account not only the adjacent transitions, but also the similarity of their adjacent states. It is shown by experimentation on two case studies that local similarity metrics can result in constructing FFSMs as concise as the FFSM resulting from the global similarity metric. The results also show that local similarity metrics increase the efficiency and scalability while maintaining the effectiveness of the FFSM construction.},

  abstract  = {Effect heterogeneity analyses using causal machine learning algorithms have gained popularity in recent years. However, the interpretation of estimated individualized effects requires caution because insights from these data-driven approaches might be misaligned with the contextual needs of a human audience. Thus, a practical framework that integrates advanced machine learning methods and decision-making remains critically needed to achieve effective implementation and scientific communication. We introduce a 2-step framework to identify characteristics associated with substantial effect heterogeneity in a practically relevant format. The proposed framework applies distinct sets of covariates for (i) estimation of individualized effects and (ii) subgroup discovery and shows the subgroups with heterogeneity based on highly interpretable if-then rules. By referring to existing metrics of interpretability, we describe how each step contributes to leveraging a theoretical advantage of machine learning models while creating an interpretable and practically relevant framework. We applied the pragmatic subgroup discovery framework for the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial to assess practically relevant and comprehensive insights into the effect heterogeneities of intense lifestyle intervention for individuals with diabetes on cardiovascular mortality. Our analysis identified (i) individuals with history of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction had the least benefit from the intervention, while (ii) individuals with no history of cardiovascular diseases and HbA1c < 7},

A lack of information regarding the temporal variation in atmospheric emissions has made it challenging to reconcile pipeline volumetric (bottom-up) estimates^ 1 – 8 with measurement-based (top-down) estimates^ 8 – 18 .

We obtain consistency between our modelled atmospheric emissions and top-down estimates and find that 465 ± 20 thousand metric tons of methane were emitted to the atmosphere.

  abstract  = {Context Forests are vital renewable resources for timber, while also serving as carbon reservoirs and habitats for many terrestrial species. However, there are tradeoffs between timber production and other ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and biodiversity, highlighting the need for new management strategies that more effectively balance these tradeoffs. This case study models the effectiveness of four such strategies, based on a newly proposed management plan for a state forest in coastal Oregon. Objectives We tested the effectiveness of four landscape-scale forest management strategies designed to minimize tradeoffs between timber production, carbon storage, and biodiversity. These strategies include land sparing (spatially separating timber production from conservation), land sharing (integrating timber production with conservation), and two variants of Triad management (dividing forests into intensive, extensive, and reserve areas). This study assesses the long-term impacts of these strategies on timber production, tree and shrub diversity, and carbon storage, while also evaluating how natural disturbances (i.e. wind and fire) and climate change could affect their relative benefits. Methods We used the spatially interactive, raster-based forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, to simulate forest succession, management, windthrow, and wildfire under a range of potential climate futures from 2016 until 2100. Results Our results demonstrate that while all management strategies ensured sustainable timber production, land sharing promoted the highest occupancy, Shannon diversity index, and biomass of key early and mid-successional tree and shrub species identified by managers for their conservation value. In contrast, Triad management and land sparing tended to maximize carbon storage. Under extreme climate projections, carbon storage was equally compromised across all management strategies and there was a further shift towards Douglas-fir dominance. Conclusion To our knowledge, this study represents the first modelled comparison of land sharing, land sparing, and Triad management under climate change and natural disturbance regimes. Management strategies differed in their provisioning of carbon, diversity, and plant biomass, and while the relative differences between these benefits remained consistent, all outcomes were negatively affected by climate change. We demonstrate the use of LANDIS-II in strategic forest planning and highlight the necessity of using spatial models for informed decision-making to simultaneously achieve multiple forest management objectives under climate change and disturbances.},

  abstract  = {We examine which decentralized finance architectures enable meaningful regulation by combining financial and computational theory. We show via deduction that a decentralized and permissionless Turing-complete system cannot provably comply with regulations concerning anti-money laundering, know-your-client obligations, some securities restrictions and forms of exchange control. Any system that claims to follow regulations must choose either a form of permission or a less-than-Turing-complete update facility. Compliant decentralized systems can be constructed only by compromising on the richness of permissible changes. Regulatory authorities must accept new tradeoffs that limit their enforcement powers if they want to approve permissionless platforms formally. Our analysis demonstrates that the fundamental constraints of computation theory have direct implications for financial regulation. By mapping regulatory requirements onto computational models, we characterize which types of automated compliance are achievable and which are provably impossible. This framework allows us to move beyond traditional debates about regulatory effectiveness to establish concrete boundaries for automated enforcement.},

  abstract  = {The Japanese Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse gases and Water cycle (GOSAT-GW) will be an Earth-observing satellite to conduct global observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO_2), methane (CH_4), and nitrogen dioxide (NO_2) simultaneously from a single platform. GOSAT-GW is the third satellite in the series of the currently operating Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) and GOSAT-2. It will carry two sensors, the Total Anthropogenic and Natural emissions mapping SpectrOmeter-3 (TANSO-3) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 3 (AMSR3), with the latter dedicated to the observation of physical parameters related to the water cycle. TANSO-3 is a high-resolution grating spectrometer designed to measure reflected sunlight in the visible to short-wave infrared spectral ranges. It aims to retrieve the column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO_2 and CH_4 (denoted as XCO_2 and XCH_4, respectively), as well as the vertical column density of tropospheric NO_2. The TANSO-3 sensor onboard GOSAT-GW will utilize the wavelength bands of 0.45, 0.76, and 1.61 µm for NO_2, O_2, and CO_2 and CH_4 retrievals, respectively. GOSAT-GW will fly in a sun-synchronous orbit with a local overpass time of approximately 13:30 and a 3-day ground-track repeat cycle. The TANSO-3 sensor has two observation modes in the push-broom operation: Wide Mode, which provides globally covered maps with a 10-km spatial resolution within 3 days, and Focus Mode, which provides snapshot maps over targeted areas with a high spatial resolution of 1–3 km. The objectives of the GOSAT-GW mission include (1) monitoring atmospheric global-mean concentrations of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), (2) verifying national anthropogenic GHG emissions inventories, and (3) detecting GHG emissions from large sources, such as megacities and power plants. A comprehensive validation exercise will be conducted to ensure that the sensor products’ quality meets the required precision to achieve the above objectives. With a projected operational lifetime of seven years, GOSAT-GW will provide vital space-based constraints on both anthropogenic and natural GHG emissions. These measurements will contribute significantly to climate change mitigation efforts, particularly by supporting the Global Stocktake (GST) mechanism, a key element of the Paris Agreement.},

These PDFs have been recently computed and can be used to define lepton-induced processes at high-energy colliders. In this article, we propose a novel way to test the computation of lepton PDFs of the proton by analyzing both non-resonant di-lepton and resonant Z gauge boson production processes induced by leptons within the proton at proton-electron colliders like HERA and EIC. Despite the fact that lepton PDFs of the proton are known to be small, this work demonstrates that both processes imply a measurable yield of events at HERA and EIC, which could be used to test these PDFs.},

  abstract  = {Precipitation impacts leaf senescence. Here, the authors use carbon flux and satellite data to demonstrate that reduced precipitation frequency is associated with a faster drought response in trees and show that Earth system models don’t capture the impact of reduced precipitation. Precipitation is an important factor influencing the date of foliar senescence, which in turn affects carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the temporal patterns of precipitation frequency and its impact on foliar senescence date remain largely unknown. Using both long-term carbon flux data and satellite observations across the Northern Hemisphere, we show that, after excluding impacts from of temperature, radiation and total precipitation by partial correlation analysis, declining precipitation frequency may drive earlier foliar senescence date from 1982 to 2022. A decrease in precipitation frequency intensifies drought stress by reducing root-zone soil moisture and increasing atmospheric dryness, and limit the photosynthesis necessary for sustained growth. The enhanced drought acclimation, showing a more rapid response to drought, also explains the positive relationship between precipitation frequency and foliar senescence date. Finally, we find 30 current state-of-art Earth system models largely fail to capture the sensitivity of DFS to changes in precipitation frequency and incorrectly predict the direction of correlations for approximately half of the northern global lands, in both historical simulations and future predictions. Our results therefore highlight the critical need to include precipitation frequency, rather than just total precipitation, into models to accurately forecast plant phenology under future climate change.},

  abstract  = {Context Practitioners prefer to achieve performance without sacrificing productivity when developing scientific software. The Julia programming language is designed to develop performant computer programs without sacrificing productivity by providing a syntax that is scripting in nature. According to the Julia programming language website, the common projects are data science, machine learning, scientific domains, and parallel computing. While Julia has yielded benefits with respect to productivity, programs written in Julia can include security weaknesses, which can hamper the security of Julia-based scientific software. A systematic derivation of security weaknesses can facilitate secure development of Julia programs—an area that remains under-explored. Objective The goal of this paper is to help practitioners securely develop Julia programs by conducting an empirical study of security weaknesses found in Julia programs. Method We apply qualitative analysis on 4,592 Julia programs used in 126 open-source Julia projects to identify security weakness categories. Next, we construct a static analysis tool called J ulia S tatic A nalysis T ool (JSAT) that automatically identifies security weaknesses in Julia programs. We apply JSAT to automatically identify security weaknesses in 558 open-source Julia projects consisting of 25,008 Julia programs. Results We identify 7 security weakness categories, which include the usage of hard-coded password and unsafe invocation. From our empirical study we identify 23,839 security weaknesses.

Through validation, our method outperforms the statistical method in simulating precipitations and river discharges. For the first time, we presented detailed insights into the intensity and duration of the 1931 flood, revealing a smaller magnitude but associated with an amplified loss, likely due to social vulnerability and reduced societal resilience compared to the 1998’s. While successful simulation can be interfered with by model variability, our dynamical method shows promise for simulating pre-instrumental flood and building a long-term pre-instrumental-hydrology database.},

  abstract  = {Globally, cardiovascular diseases remain among the leading causes of mortality, highlighting the urgent need for innovative research models. Consequently, the development of accurate models that simulate cardiac function holds significant scientific and clinical value for both disease research and therapeutic interventions. Cardiac organoids, which are three-dimensional structures derived from the induced differentiation of stem cells, are particularly promising. These organoids not only replicate the autonomous beating and essential electrophysiological properties of the heart but are also widely employed in studies related to cardiac diseases, drug efficacy testing, and regenerative medicine. This review comprehensively surveys the various fabrication techniques used to create cardiac organoids and their diverse applications in modeling a range of cardiac diseases. We emphasize the role of advanced technologies in enhancing the maturation and functionality of cardiac cells, ensuring that these models closely resemble native cardiac tissue. Furthermore, we discuss monitoring techniques and evaluation parameters critical for assessing the performance of cardiac organoids, considering the complex interactions within multi-organ systems. This approach is vital for enhancing precision and efficiency in drug development, allowing for more effective therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a thorough and innovative perspective on both fundamental research and clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases, offering insights that could pave the way for future advancements in understanding and addressing these prevalent health challenges.

In this study, we developed a comprehensive physiologically-based quantitative systematic pharmacology model of the alogliptin-glucose control system to predict plasma exposure and use glucose as a clinical endpoint to prospectively understand its therapeutic outcomes with varying renal function. Our model incorporates a PBPK model for alogliptin, DPP-4 activity described by receptor occupancy theory, and the crosstalk and feedback loops for GLP-1-GIP-glucagon, insulin, and glucose. Based on the optimization of renal function-dependent parameters, the model was extrapolated to different stages renal impairment patients. Ultimately our model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin, the progression of DPP-4 inhibition over time and the dynamics of the glucose control system components. The extrapolation results endorse the dose adjustment regimen of 12.5 mg once daily for moderate patients and 6.25 mg once daily for severe and ESRD patients, while providing additional reflections and insights. In clinical practice, our model could provide additional information on the in vivo fate of DPP4 inhibitors and key regulators of the glucose control system.},

  abstract  = {Statically typed languages offer numerous benefits to developers, such as improved code quality and reduced runtime errors, but they also require the overhead of manual type annotations. To mitigate this burden, language designers have started incorporating support for type inference, where the compiler infers the type of a variable based on its declaration/usage context. As a result, type annotations are optional in certain contexts, and developers are empowered to use type inference in these situations. However, the usage patterns of type annotations in languages that support type inference are unclear. These patterns can help provide evidence for further research in program comprehension, in language design, and for education. We conduct a large-scale empirical study using Boa, a tool for mining software repositories, to investigate when and where developers use type inference in 498,963 Kotlin projects. We choose Kotlin because it is the default language for Android development, one of the largest software marketplaces. Additionally, Kotlin has supported declaration-site optional type annotations from its initial release. Our findings reveal that type inference is frequently employed for local variables and variables initialized with method calls declared outside the file are more likely to use type inference. These results have significant implications for language designers, providing valuable insight into where to allow type inference and how to optimize type inference algorithms for maximum efficiency, ultimately improving the development experience for developers.},

This study introduces GameScript, a simplified scripting language designed for video game development. Based on principles of structured programming and inspired by the While language, GameScript focuses on essential game behavior definitions using a limited set of statements, including IF-THEN-ELSE selection and operations related to game elements to create and destroy them, or to modify properties. By using only numeric variables and simple arithmetic and relational operators, GameScript simplifies data handling and allows for the creation of various arcade games with straightforward syntax. Integrated into a multi-agent system game engine, GameScript has been validated through the successful implementation of diverse arcade game mechanics, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {We present an argument about the methodology of ethics, broadly conceived, drawing on recent research on modelling in the philosophy of science. More specifically, we argue that normative ethics should adopt the methodology of modelling. We make our case in two parts. First, despite the perhaps unfamiliar terminology, modelling already happens in ethics. We identify it, and argue that its practice could be improved by recognising that it is modelling and by adopting some methodological lessons from philosophy of science. Second, modelling should be adopted more widely within normative ethics, because it fits well with various methodological ends we shall identify. Models can be used to investigate ethical questions in a manner that is systematic but relatively free of foundational theoretical commitments in first-order ethics. Models are more local, and less ambitious, than theories. They can be used to break deadlocks, by focusing attention on the particularities of a sub-domain and by providing a common tool–the surrogate model system–which each side can use to make their principles precise, illustrate the implications of their view, and identify sources of disagreement or points of agreement. We are pluralists about method, so this is not a call to abandon other philosophical methods. It is simply a plea for modelling, motivated by the method’s independent benefits and its fruitfulness in resolving some persistent methodological problems in ethics.},

Vegetation cover regulates the exchanges of energy, water and carbon between land and atmosphere. Remotely-sensed fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), a land-surface greenness measure, depends on carbon allocation to foliage while also controlling photon flux for photosynthesis. Here we use an equation with just two globally fitted parameters to describe annual maximum fAPAR as the smaller of a water-limited value transpiring a constant fraction of annual precipitation, and an energy-limited value maximizing annual plant growth. This minimalist description reproduces global greenness patterns and temporal trends in remote-sensing data, comparable to the best-performing dynamic global vegetation models. Widely observed greening is attributed principally to the influence of rising carbon dioxide on the light- and water-use efficiencies of photosynthesis; limited browning regions are attributed to drying.

A gene encoding GFP was introduced downstream of the key enzymes involved in limonene biosynthesis to enable real-time kinetics monitoring and the identification of cell heterogeneity according to microscopic and flow cytometric analyses. Three different plasmid configurations (one correct and two incorrect) were identified through cell sorting based on subpopulations expressing different levels of GFP at 10 and 50 µM IPTG.

  abstract  = {Robustness against measurement uncertainties is crucial for gas turbine engine diagnosis. While current research focuses mainly on measurement noise, measurement bias remains challenging. This study proposes a novel performance-based fault detection and identification (FDI) strategy for twin-shaft turbofan gas turbine engines and addresses these uncertainties through a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference system. To handle ambient condition changes, we use parameter correction to preprocess the raw measurement data, which reduces the FDI’s system complexity. Additionally, the power-level angle is set as a scheduling parameter to reduce the number of rules in the TSK-based FDI system. The data for designing, training, and testing the proposed FDI strategy are generated using a component-level turbofan engine model. The antecedent and consequent parameters of the TSK-based FDI system are optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm and ridge regression. A robust structure combining a specialized fuzzy inference system with the TSK-based FDI system is proposed to handle measurement biases. The performance of the first-order TSK-based FDI system and robust FDI structure are evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies. Comparative studies confirm the superior accuracy of the first-order TSK-based FDI system in fault detection, isolation, and identification. The robust structure demonstrates a 2},

  abstract  = {Bearings are critical in mechanical systems, as their health impacts system reliability. Proactive monitoring and diagnosing of bearing faults can prevent significant safety issues. Among various diagnostic methods that analyze bearing vibration signals, deep learning is notably effective. However, bearings often operate in noisy environments, especially during failures, which poses a challenge to most current deep learning methods that assume noise-free data. Therefore, this paper designs a Multi-Location Multi-Scale Multi-Level Information Attention Activation Network (MLSCA-CW) with excellent performance in different kinds of strong noise environments by combining soft threshold, self-activation, and self-attention mechanisms. The model has enhanced filtering performance and multi-location information fusion ability. Our comparative and ablation experiments demonstrate that the model’s components, including the multi-location and multi-scale vibration extraction module, soft threshold noise filtering module, multi-scale self-activation mechanism, and layer attention mechanism, are highly effective in filtering noise from various locations and extracting multi-dimensional features. The MLSCA-CW model achieves 92.02},

To address these issues, a high-precision stress mapping method of hydraulic column is proposed. The hydraulic column loss function was constructed to guide the data-driven model training, and the cylinder stress mechanism model was established by using the elastic–plastic theory of thick-walled cylinder. The weight coefficients of the data-driven model and the mechanism model were determined by the measurement data, and the high-precision stress mapping results were obtained by combining the data-driven model data and mechanism model data. A monitoring platform was built for the unit hydraulic support column, and the unit hydraulic support column was used as the test object to carry out pressure tests of 600 kN, 800 kN, 1000 kN and 1200 kN.

  abstract  = {Context and motivation: In recent years, behavior trees have gained growing interest within the robotics community as a specification and control-switching mechanism for the different tasks that form a robotics mission. Problem: Given the rising complexity and prevalence of robotic systems, it is increasingly challenging and important for practitioners to design high-quality missions that meet certain qualities, for instance, to consider potential failures or mitigate safety risks. In software requirements engineering, quality or non-functional requirements have long been recognized as a key factor in system success. Currently, qualities are not represented in behavior-tree models, which capture a robotic mission, making it difficult to assess the extent to which different mission components comply with those qualities. Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we propose an extension for behavior trees to have qualities and quality requirements explicitly represented in robotics missions. We provide a meta-model for the extension, develop a domain-specific language (DSL), and describe how we integrated our DSL in one of the most used languages in robotics for developing behavior trees, BehaviorTree.CPP . A preliminary evaluation of the implemented DSL shows promising results for the feasibility of our approach and the need for similar DSLs. Contribution: Our approach paves the way for incorporating qualities into the behavior model of robotics missions. This promotes early expression of qualities in robotics missions, and a better overview of missions’ components and their contribution to the satisfaction of quality concerns.},

  abstract  = {Conceptual modelling (CM) has gained prominence in software development, especially with the rise of low-code/no-code development techniques rooted in model-driven development (MDD), which simplify coding complexity and bridge the gap between business and IT. However, these approaches are not without issues, as errors in models can lead to unreliable, error-prone software. One particular challenge for modellers is that of potential deadlock situations which can obstruct the system’s components and make it unable to finish the assigned tasks. This paper reports a study that aimed to explore how an Automated Feedback System (AFS) can assist novice modellers in identifying and rectifying possible deadlock situations in conceptual models. The study consisted of a two-group posttest-only experimental design, allowing to assess the impact of an AFS-enhanced approach on novice modellers’ ability to identify and correct deadlock-related errors in the context of a CM course. Unfortunately, the experiment did not conclusively demonstrate that the AFS-enhanced approach significantly improves novice modellers’ performance. Nonetheless, after performing additional post-hoc statistical tests on the behavioural data collected from the participants during the CM course prior to the experiment, we were able to conclude that this negative result was in part due to an imbalanced experimental group division. Subsequently, we redivided the participants based on the self-reported usage of a model-simulation tool during the experiment, which did allow us to find evidence for one of our hypotheses. We conclude the paper by proposing several improvements to the used experimental design as well as the implications for teaching conceptual modelling based on the already found results.},

  abstract  = {Robotic assembly in flexible manufacturing faces challenges in adapting to dynamic environments and handling system failures. These challenges necessitate swift identification and execution of recovery processes without impeding ongoing operations. Furthermore, the capability limitations of existing robots require adaptive solutions that integrate additional robots and implement compensation actions. Model-driven development offers significant advantages for robotic assembly systems, particularly in maintaining consistency, facilitating recovery process identification, and seamlessly integrating new plug-in robots, yet challenges remain in fully leveraging these benefits in dynamic manufacturing environments. Addressing these challenges, this paper presents a novel constraint-based model using Reference Attribute Grammars (RAGs) to extend an existing knowledge-based approach, enabling self-healing capabilities in robotic assembly processes. Our model integrates with a MAPE-K feedback loop, facilitating real-time adaptation to environmental changes and system failures. By combining constraint checking and assembly sequence planning, our approach allows for efficient fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery. A key innovation of our work is the implementation of a modular, extensible constraint model that defines constraints for robots, components, and processes. This design enables incremental reevaluation of constraints and assembly processes, supporting continuous monitoring, analysis, and replanning. We demonstrate the efficacy of our self-healing capabilities through two scenarios involving multiple robots with diverse capabilities collaborating on product assembly. These scenarios showcase the system’s ability to dynamically reorganize plug-in robots and reallocate tasks and resources in response to failures.},

  abstract  = {The proliferation of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies has significantly increased cybersecurity risks. Modern vehicles, as complex and networked computer systems, require comprehensive protection against malicious ejpt@metacase.comxternal attacks, much like conventional computers. Addressing these challenges requires robust tools that align established automotive model-based development approaches with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard for automotive cybersecurity, which became mandatorpublication in 2021. Building on prior research, this paper introduces key innovations in the conceptual framework and the tool support that integrate seamlessly into existing automotive development methodologies. These advancements are rooted in extensions to the Security Abstraction Model (SAM) informed by the ISO/SAE 21434 standard. Notably, SAM now incorporates advanced methods for score calculation, including an attack potential-based approach for assessing attack feasibility and the computation of risk scores using risk matrices. Usability improvements are also a contribution, achieved through the introduction of BPMN-style (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams tailored for the accessible visualization of otherwise complex security models. These diagrams make multifaceted attack trees easier to interpret, enabling managers and other non-technical stakeholders to intuitively understand security vulnerabilities and make informed decisions. Additionally, the tool supports updated metrics for impact and risk analysis, demonstrated through practical applications involving automotive subsystems such as braking. These examples illustrate improved traceability between SAM and functional design, ensuring that cybersecurity requirements are effectively integrated into the broader development lifecycle.},

To deal with this challenge we propose an iterative formal model-driven approach that helps validating step-by-step a real formal specification of ERTMS/ETCS hybrid level 3. Our approach introduces Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) to help system experts understand existing specifications that are already proven.

  abstract  = {At the heart of Product Line Engineering (PLE) lies the feature model, which describes how features can be combined to create customized variability and commonality in the development of reconfigurable cyber-physical systems. Since standardized processes are key to high-quality product development, managing their variability should align with PLE principles and regulatory standards. However, misconfigurations frequently arise due to the complexity of these standardized processes leading to potentially hazardous conditions. Therefore, containment verification of each configuration in variability management remains a complex task, that requires extensive analysis and considerable effort. We introduce a containment verification approach to determine whether a certain product configuration is consistent with the specification defined in a feature model. Our method provides a model-based architectural analysis that identifies misconfiguration against the architecture and the potential damage scenarios of their mitigations. To facilitate this task, we model the security architecture and requirements in an Eclipse-based IDE that supports all phases of feature-oriented software development for PLE. Subsequently, the proposed approach performs automated transformation of these models, using the Acceleo transformation language, into formal constraints and descriptions, in order to leverage the analytical power of model-checking techniques. The formal verification of completeness, consistency, and conflict is carried out using the NuSMV model checker. In case a counterexample is produced, a change impact analysis is performed for the identification of problems and their resolutions. We conducted a case study to evaluate the accuracy of the verification results and the inferred model transformations.},

This separation of concerns naturally leads to a proliferation of models, and thus to the challenge of ensuring that all models actually represent the same system. We can study this problem by considering that the property is abstracted as a relation between models called consistency. Yet, the exact nature of this relation remains unclear in the context of cyber-physical systems, as such models are heterogeneous and may not be formally described. Therefore, we propose a formal foundation for consistency relations, by (1) providing a set-theoretical description of the virtual single underlying model (V-SUM) methodology, (2) relating consistency to model transformations, and (3) studying the connection between consistency of models and their semantics. In particular, we show that a relation on the semantic spaces of models can be reflected as a relation on models and that this semantics forms a lattice, such that a canonical semantics can be derived from a consistency relation. Our findings lay the foundation for a formal reasoning about precise notions of consistency.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an approach for the static analysis of the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents deployed on cyber-physical systems (CPS) using the Petri nets (PN) and Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. A CPS integrates computational and physical components that require verification to ensure correct and safe operation before executing the BDI agents deployed on the CPS. The BDI agent architecture provides a model for programming intelligent behaviour on CPS, while PN offers a formalism for analyzing these behaviours. This way, the operation of the BDI agents can be statically analyzed by simulating the PN before their deployment on the CPS. To this end, the semantic space of the BDI agents can be transformed into the PN by MDE. Since the BDI model provides a high-level programming abstraction that requires high expressiveness, the Coloured Petri nets (CPN) formalism has been employed to detect the undesired execution paths. Hence, BDI agents are mapped onto Petri nets, allowing the translation of the Jason BDI AgentSpeak code into a CPN model. This mapping verifies properties such as reachability, boundedness and deadlock. Moreover, a case study is presented to demonstrate the approach’s applicability. The results highlight the proof-of-concept of this approach on a single but pertinent agent to identify and resolve potential issues, contributing to developing verified CPSs.},

In contrast, specialized manufacturing process simulation tools typically adopt a resource-based approach which, while effective in certain aspects, often lacks robust process modeling capabilities and requires custom coding to define detailed system behaviors. Although prior research has explored extending BPMN to better support manufacturing scenarios, there is still a lack of tools that integrate both activity-centric and resource-centric approaches for comprehensive modeling and simulation. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel metamodel that extends BPMN with enhanced resource capabilities. We present a process modeler that allows users to design manufacturing processes and a corresponding simulator that uses these models to generate insightful information about the process performance through simulation. The solution proposed is then validated using both made-up and real-world manufacturing scenarios.},

  abstract  = {In the traditional development process of electric locomotive traction control software, there existed problems such as high labor costs, inconsistent development standards, difficult software verification, and high software maintenance costs. MBD (Model-Based-Design) and the automatic code generation technology were mostly used in the field of automotive electronics, promoted in several mainstream automobile factories, but had hardly ventured into the field of rail transit. The MBD method was applied to the development process of electric locomotive traction control software, to realize the model-based traction control logic and algorithm development in the MATLAB platform. The paper shows the process of designing the traction control model, generating the code and being downloaded to the traction control unit automatically, finally, testing the system with HIL (Hardware-In-Loop) semi-physical simulation. The four-quadrant waveforms met the design requirements. The results showed that it was feasible, efficient and economical to design the four-quadrant control software of the traction converter by the MBD method.},

  abstract  = {Massive crowd simulation offers valuable insights into human behavior, with applications in urban planning, public safety, computer animation, and beyond. However, traditional methods that treat crowds as individual agents face significant scalability challenges as crowd sizes grow, resulting in performance bottlenecks. While there are advanced animation engines capable of supporting the efficient rendering of large-scale crowds, existing crowd simulation frameworks often face limitations in scalability and flexibility. In response to these challenges, we present TaiCrowd, an open-source crowd simulation framework. TaiCrowd employs a generic parallel approach specifically designed for agent-based methods, filling the current gap for a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly crowd simulation framework. Experiment results show that TaiCrowd achieves a substantial 60-fold improvement for crowd simulations involving hundred thousand individuals compared to other simulation frameworks, outperforming existing frameworks and enabling real-time simulation for large-scale crowd management.

  abstract  = {End-User Programming (EUP) environments typically offer either a text-based or a visual programming language for end users. Even when both options are provided, they lack real-time synchronization between the two representations. This study explores the integration of the textual and visual representations of a domain-specific language (DSL) for EUP based on Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) scenarios. By combining a visual editor featuring a block-based language with a textual representation featuring syntax highlighting, error detection, and auto-completion, the platform can enhance accessibility, flexibility, and efficiency in EUP. The primary challenge investigated is achieving real-time, two-way synchronization between the visual and textual editors to maintain consistent code representation, crucial for an optimal user experience. The solution leverages Blockly’s custom code generators to translate blocks to text and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to convert text to blocks. We evaluated our approach in two use cases in the robotics domain, confirming the potential of the dual editor to offer flexible, domain-tailored end-user programming, with potential for broad future applications.},

The key idea is to generate the required templates from appropriately annotated runnable prototypes written in the target language. In essence, this turns template definition into a two-step process: 1. writing a prototype (base configuration) in the target language, and 2. annotating the prototype’s AST with parameterized operations that, given the required parameters, allow one to transform this base configuration into the intended target code. The advantage of this approach is that prototypes, in contrast to templates, can be conveniently developed and evolved with the full tool support of common software development. We illustrate the ease of CCG-based code generator development by first specifying and then evolving the required templates in order to overcome a detected security vulnerability. A proof-of-concept implementation is publicly available for reproducibility.},

  abstract  = {Acquisition and Learning of procedural (e.g. Technical) and Non-Technical competencies by flight crew are critical factors for the elevation of Aviation and Aerospace safety. In this context, simulators provide a risk free and safe environment for the acquisition, application and practice of necessary flying competencies and behaviors. Among the most demanding tasks for the effectiveness of flight simulator training is the customization of the training scenarios (e.g. flight scripts) to the individual trainee competencies, based on data provided from real flight operations and previous trainee performance assessments. This customization is still mainly the responsibility of a certified flight instructor rendering thus their design and development a challenging process in terms of time, effort, knowledge and other resources that need to be invested. A promising solution to this challenge lies in the development of a software framework that will support a flight instructor in semi-automatically design, publish and re-use flight training scripts. The software framework will pre-populate some fundamental components in the flight script and then the flight instructor would be given the “final touch” (i.e. Go/Non Go decision) for fine tuning the training session. Information and data for prepopulating the script could be provided by Air Transportation authorities, Airlines, Flight Simulator Manufacturers and Flight Training Academies. For making this integrated system to work, a shared conceptualization is required between the different entities that will provide data, for our proposed software framework. In this work we present initial efforts for such information interoperability by setting the foundations for a description language for flight training scenarios, namely Unified Flight Training Language (UFTL). The primary purpose for developing UFTL is to define a common terminology (i.e. shared conceptualization vocabulary) required for the representation of flight training scripts based on the principles of Scenario Based Training and Evidence Based Training (EBT).},

Here, we explore a different path and define a natural-language semantics for a component UML model that embodies state machines and composite structure diagrams. We then integrate with the NAT2TEST strategy to provide means for analysis (via model checking and theorem proving), simulation and testing. The integration is based on a systematic process (mapping rules), and its soundness has been validated considering an independent reference formal semantics. The developed tool support automates the translation from UML models to natural-language requirements directly based on the proposed mapping rules. We illustrate our contributions and tool support with respect to two case studies: the classical Dijkstra’s dining philosophers problem, and a distributed ring-buffer model.},

In particular, the EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities outlines criteria for when business practices contribute towards a sustainable future. However, it is unclear in how far existing methods for identifying, analysing, and improving business practices, in particular those of the disciplines of Business Process Management (BPM) and Green BPM (that is, a variant of BPM with a focus on environmental sustainability) can relate to those criteria and the concepts contained therein. Therefore, we develop and propose a metamodel that combines concepts of the EU taxonomy and Green BPM, and clarifies the relationship of the two frameworks. This metamodel increases conceptual clarity and allows practitioners to apply Green BPM approaches in light of the EU taxonomy, and researchers and tool providers to further explore technical solutions in light of the EU taxonomy. It provides a clear overview of how the gap between sustainability regulations and approaches for sustainable business practices can be bridged. We evaluate the semantics and pragmatics of our metamodel, and sketch potential applications with an illustrative example.},

The iterative process encourages collaboration between users, designers and developers, prioritizing consistency between user expectations and technical specifications. The tool’s architecture comprises modules to import design metadata, enrich components with pattern-based rules, and generate reusable code.

The findings indicate significant improvements in attention, communication, and adaptive behaviors, suggesting that MR technologies can be a powerful tool in the special education toolkit . Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of MR to bridge gaps in traditional educational methods, offering a supportive and engaging learning environment for children with autism.

In the meantime, although model-based techniques are being used widely to address the design of complex systems, but are not extended to their operation—in particular when dealing with faults: operators can benefit from the use of formal models for system monitoring and diagnostics. We thus propose a methodology to create a new type of Operations Dedicated Model (ODM) from the already existing system design models (functional and dysfunctional), with the use of the Behaviour Tree (BT) formalism. With the assumption that Safety Analysis (SA) models describe dysfunctional aspects of the system—notably via Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), we us Fault Trees (FTs) as an input for the ODM construction. We also demonstrate our proposed approach on a Satellite Ground Station example, and discuss how ODMs can improve systems’ operations.},

  abstract  = {Many children are introduced to LEGO^® bricks for the first time at a young age. LEGO^® models are usually built according to a set of building instructions, each instruction step being printed onto paper as an orthographic projection. However, as children’s spatial reasoning skills are yet to be fully developed, they tend to misinterpret positions and shapes from these types of instructions, resulting in suboptimal performance in LEGO^® construction tasks. With Augmented Reality (AR), users can perceive and interact with three-dimensional, virtual content as if it was present in the real world, eliminating the need to convert two-dimensional instructions into three-dimensional models. In this work, an AR - A ssisted L EGO^® B uilding I nstruction (ARALBI) application was developed, providing three-dimensional reference LEGO^® models. ARALBI was specifically designed to be used by preschool children, with them constructing the real model step by step next to the virtual model. It was tested against typical paper-building instructions in a user study based on the General Assembly Task Model (GATM). Using AR instructions, preschool children performed better in terms of effectiveness (i.e. made fewer mistakes) but not efficiency (i.e. required more time to finish assembling the model) when compared to paper instructions. The results of this study indicated that preschool children, who never used AR technology before, enjoyed the use of the AR application and preferred it over paper-building instructions.},

Typically, changes in one design phase may affect all subsequent phases or even affect the entire design process. Graph-based design languages (GBDLs) offer a unified and consistent digital data model capable to store and propagate relationships of design objects via linked graph nodes, thereby expressing the different mutual dependencies for design modifications within the model. By defining the contents of the knowledge domains in a vocabulary, rules and a rule sequence, the entire design process can be described and executed automatically.

Specifically, we employed a modified Mitchell-Schaeffer computational model and calibrated per case the key parameter that tunes the action potential duration using the recorded intracardiac ECGs. To validate the predictions, we compared the measured VT cycle length (CL) per case to the simulated VTCL obtained from each calibrated digital twin by precisely replicating the experimental inducibility protocol. We further defined 100 pacing sites on the right and left endocardial surfaces, respectively, and investigated the impact of pacing location on the VT inducibility. Overall, results demonstrated that our pipeline was able to accurately predict VT inducibility after calibration, reproducing the experimental VT with a small error in CLs (i.e., <4},

By employing a clustering-based approach, we aim to statistically identify commonalities and differences among companies and examine the relationships between risk-related topics and various management indicators. Our analysis utilizes Fin-BERT, a domain-specific language model, and compares it with a general BERT to assess their ability to capture nuanced patterns in corporate risk descriptions. The results demonstrate that Fin-BERT effectively captures granular semantic information, particularly in financial contexts, which standard models might overlook. We observed a modest correlation between shifts in corporate risk descriptions and key management metrics, such as stock price fluctuations, indicating that risk narratives influence investor perceptions and pricing behaviors. These findings suggest opportunities to improve the integration of domain-specific language models into financial analysis and provide a foundation for future research to explore industry-specific variations and refine the methodologies for analyzing corporate risk descriptions.},

In this work, we present SkiNet, a user-oriented tool which aims to assist in the design of skill-based robotic systems using a formal model based on Petri nets. The main idea for SkiNet is to interpret the user-written specifications and properties, into elements from the formal model, and vice versa. This allows the user to be more independent when diagnosing and validating the specified behavior, without having to directly manipulate the back-end formal tools. An example of the verification process of robotic skills specifications using SkiNet is given to showcase this paradigm.},

  abstract  = {When considering risky events or actions, we must not downplay the role of involved objects: a charged battery in our phone averts the risk of being stranded in the desert after a flat tyre, and a functional firewall mitigates the risk of a hacker intruding the network. The Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER) highlights how the role of objects and their relationships remains pivotal to performing transparent, complete and accountable risk assessment. In this paper, we operationalize some of the notions proposed by COVER – such as parthood between objects and participation of objects in events/actions – by presenting a new framework for risk assessment: WATCHDOG. WATCHDOG enriches the expressivity of vetted formal models for risk – i.e., fault trees and attack trees – by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an ontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling formalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (DOGs), logic (DOGLog) and an intermediate query language (DOGLang). With these, WATCHDOG allows risk assessors to pose questions about disruption propagation , disruption likelihood and risk levels , keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in sight.},

  abstract  = {Situational awareness (SA) is crucial in convoy-following tasks, where drivers must accurately anticipate and respond to the lead vehicle’s behavior to ensure safety and efficiency. This study investigates the role of mental models (MMs) in enhancing SA, focusing on the design of human-machine interfaces (HMI) that align with drivers’ cognitive mechanisms. The research explores how various HMI designs, guided by key mental models, improve drivers’ ability to perceive, understand, and predict the lead vehicle’s behavior in dynamic driving scenarios. Four fundamental MMs are identified: the distance perception model, the response prediction model, the risk assessment model, and the attention allocation model. The study evaluates HMI interface designs that vary in the level and type of information displayed to the driver, with a focus on visualizations of lead vehicle status and following distances. The results indicate that presenting multiple levels of information significantly enhances SA by providing drivers with contextually relevant data, without overwhelming their cognitive resources. These findings offer valuable insights into designing adaptive HMI systems that support drivers in complex, high-pressure environments, improving situational awareness and overall performance in convoy-following tasks.},

  abstract  = {As a critical component of wind turbines, the scarcity of fault data for the main bearing presents significant challenges for fault diagnosis. Generative adversarial network (GAN) presents a new approach to tackle fault diagnosis with small samples but still faces issues such as training instability. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on WSRGAN-GP and LSTM for time-series data. Time-series data are transformed into image data, and WSRGAN-GP is utilized for data augmentation. Fault diagnosis is achieved using an LSTM model. Firstly, a loss function is designed by incorporating Wasserstein distance and gradient penalty. Secondly, a generator is constructed using a residual block, and a GAN model with a self-attention mechanism is developed. Finally, an LSTM model is employed for fault diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively diagnoses faults in wind turbines under small sample conditions, validating the efficacy of the model.},

  abstract  = {Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is designed to separate the target from complex background clutter. Challenges in discerning minor infrared targets stem from their diminutive size and the absence of texture cues within intricate surroundings. The UNet architecture has promoted the development of IRSTD. However, when the target and background are highly similar, existing methods will cause serious false positives and missed detections due to the loss of target discriminant features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-scale complementary feature fusion network (MCFFNet). Initially, we design a parallel feature aggregation (PFA) module, which helps to better extract target features information and reduce feature loss due to the downsampling process. Subsequently, we propose an adjacent feature enhancement (AFE) module that bridges semantic differences between encoder and decoder by augmenting encoder output features. Finally, we present a progressive feature fusion (PFF) module to facilitate the information interaction of shallow and deep features. Comprehensive testing on the NUAA-SIRST and NUDT-SIRST datasets confirms the superiority of MCFFNet over current IRSTD approaches making it a promising solution for IRSTD tasks.},

  abstract  = {Currently, the landscape of computer hardware architecture presents the characteristics of heterogeneity and diversity, prompting widespread attention to cross-platform portable parallel programming techniques. Most existing portable programming approaches adopt the “MPI+X” strategy, focusing mainly on node-level “X” parallelism, while inter-node parallelization still relies on manual MPI programming. OP2 is a domain-specific language-based portable parallel programming framework for unstructured mesh applications that supports the automatic generation of MPI parallel code. However, programmers must manually write pre-processing code during code refactoring, such as handling the mapping relationship between global and process-local variables and the initial distribution of process-local data. In this paper, we propose MARO (MPI Automatic Refactoring for OP2), an automatic refactoring method for generating pre-processing code targeting MPI code generation within the OP2 programming framework for unstructured mesh applications. This method automatically generates the pre-processing code required for MPI parallelism through the source-to-source translator, enabling OP2 to generate MPI parallel code without requiring users to write MPI-related code manually. We compare the automatically refactored OP2 applications using the proposed method with those manually refactored to validate its effectiveness. The proposed method enhances OP2’s automatic parallel code generation capability, enabling it to achieve fully automatic MPI parallelization.},

Although this is largely recognized, how to achieve it is still a relatively ambiguous desideratum. In the dynamic and competitive tourism industry, managing and designing personalized travel itineraries in an effective way is essential for ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. In this paper, we aim to contribute to improving this process by providing a solution that involves the creation of a conceptual modeling language. The language can be used for two model types: one for creating the actual itineraries, and another one for representing the resources needed for certain tourist attractions, such as necessary equipment. Additionally, we will store information from the created models in a graph database using RDF serialization, benefiting of the Linked Data capabilities that enable connecting with information that resides outside the modeling environment (e.g. about each tourist). Using a graph-based structure enables data analysis and easier identification of connections and patterns between elements.},

However, current Wi-Fi human sensing suffers from the “data scarcity” problem: all the existing proposals require collecting a large amount of human-based datasets to train the sensing models, which is labor-intensive and may raise ethical concerns in certain scenarios. This obstacle seriously restricts the size, quality, and diversity of available datasets, thereby affecting the sensing performance in terms of accuracy and cross-domain applicability.

For this reason, providing assurance that Simulink models fulfill given functional and timing requirements is desirable. In this paper, we propose formal syntax and semantics of Simulink blocks and their composition, and introduce the tool SIMPPAAL that automates a previously introduced pattern-based, execution-order preserving transformation of Simulink atomic and composite blocks into stochastic timed automata. The resulting model can then be analyzed formally with UPPAAL Statistical Model Checker. We validate the approach on an industrial prototype called the Brake-by-Wire system.

We present a comprehensive bilingual health news corpus comprising 68,603 articles spanning 2018–2025, with a carefully constructed evaluation set featuring 470 high-quality health news clusters. The HealthBridge framework integrates advanced text representation strategies with temporal constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that, for the task of cross-lingual health news association, methods based on complex vector representations significantly outperform explicit entity matching techniques. HealthBridge advances both cross-lingual natural language processing and global health communication by enabling systematic analysis of health reporting across linguistic boundaries.

  abstract  = {The rise of Industry 4.0 has spurred a growing need for smart, interconnected production systems and supply chains in manufacturing. In this context, the seamless integration of Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) practices is crucial for ensuring operational efficiency, product quality, and regulatory compliance across the manufacturing life-cycle. This paper presents a formal foundation for the Object-Oriented Event-Graph (OOEG) language, which aims to enable efficient simulation within the MOM architecture. At the core of this work is the proposal and formal definition of a new OOEG language, named Refinement Calculus for Object-Oriented Event-Graph (rCOE), and we explore the language’s operational semantics. This rigorous semantics specification provides a solid theoretical underpinning for the OOEG language, facilitating precise formalization and simulation of complex manufacturing processes. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach, we present a real-world case study within the aviation manufacturing domain, focusing on the partial assembly phase.},

As nano-technology and bio-engineering continue to advance, the feasibility of molecular communication is constantly improving. This paper examines the feasibility of using magnetic nanomaterials as information carriers for medium-distance transmission driven by magnetic field force, based on the existing molecular communication theory of diffuse channel. The study compares the two situations with and without relay. After conducting derivation and simulation verification, it can be concluded that the transmission rate and bit error rate data results are excellent when under the influence of magnetic field force drive.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we delve into the issues of radio resource and energy management in wireless networks with hybrid energy supply. Within this network, base stations (BSs) are driven by both the conventional power grid and renewable energy sources, with the capability to share the energy collected. To achieve efficient collaborative management of radio resource and energy resources, we propose a distributed resource management framework based on multi-layered games. The primary objective of this framework is to minimize the energy consumption of BSs, all the while ensuring that quality of service (QoS) requirements for each user are met. The framework consists of two distinct strategies, organized in a hierarchical and distributed fashion: the radio resource allocation (RRA) strategy, which addresses interference coordination and power control, and the energy sharing (ES) strategy, designed for collaboration in BS energy resources. These strategies undergo updates facilitated by game theory algorithms, and their interaction effectively a d dresses the issue of BS energy consumption. Through extensive simulation experiments, we substantiate the effectiveness of our framework in reducing the energy consumption of BSs while simultaneously meeting the QoS requirements of users.},

  abstract  = {The microservices architecture (MSA) is highly popular for its scalability, deployability in the Cloud and compatibility with DevOps practices. Many companies are migrating their legacy systems to an MSA. They need to rely on automatic approaches to ease their migration while taking into account their business features. Existing migration approaches to an MSA often focus on technical features but neglect functional ones, which are essential for appropriate MS granularity. To address this lack, we introduce BOAM (Business Oriented identification Approach of Microservices), a hybrid approach that focuses on business decomposition by leveraging not only technical features, such as source code, but also business oriented artifacts, especially use cases . BOAM thus leverages static and semantic analyses of source code using nanoentities (data, operations or artifacts), followed by a semantic analysis of use cases to capture business features. For that, BOAM leans on machine learning, particularly clustering methods, to identify microservices through technical (source code) and business (use cases) artifacts. The goal is to ensure that identified microservices are technically sound and meet specific business features of the company. Our evaluation shows that BOAM outperforms other literature approaches to identify microservices, achieving an average precision of 74.51},

  abstract  = {In the wake of escalating service demands on key-section components within renewable energy systems, coupled with the ambitious goals of carbon neutrality, this paper introduces the novel “engineering damage theory.“ This groundbreaking theoretical framework is the cornerstone of our study, designed to transcend the limitations inherent in existing life assessment methodologies, which predominantly provide passive macroscopic predictions without the capability for dynamic adaptation and regulation. By integrating disciplines such as material science, information science, and mechanical science, the engineering damage theory provides a comprehensive, full-chain approach to understanding and managing the progression of structural damage from the microscale to macroscale. The development and implementation of this theory are articulated through four interconnected stages: deformation mechanism, damage regulation, life prediction, and reliability assessment. Key direction in the future to this theory is the establishment of an advanced intelligent life-management platform, which leverages real-time data acquisition and analytics to enhance the assessment of damage resistance in critical components. This platform supports the foundational elements for a next-generation digital twin system equipped with active feedback capabilities, aimed at optimizing the operational performance and safety of mechanical structures. By shifting from a traditionally passive life assessment to an active life design, the engineering damage theory not only aims to significantly extend the operational lifespan of structures but also to enhance their safety and efficiency. This proactive approach is particularly crucial in high-stakes environments where the failure of components can lead to severe consequences. Furthermore, by aligning this theory with carbon reduction initiatives, it contributes directly to the sustainability goals of modern engineering practices, promoting longer life cycles and reduced resource consumption in clean energy and beyond.},

Traditional customer flow analyses, through measurements or simulations, have not sufficiently accounted for behavioral changes due to time or events, failing to capture the variations in customer behavior across different situations. This paper proposes a method that dynamically captures changes in customer behavior by sequentially incorporating measurement data into simulations. We employ a particle filter, a data assimilation technique, to agent-based simulation to dynamically estimate the customer’s transition tendencies between stores. The evaluation of the proposed method involves estimating the transition tendencies in a virtual shopping mall based on real-time inflow counts of customers. The experiments show that the proposed method can qualitatively estimate the dynamically changing customer’s transition tendencies. Implementing this approach could afford a dynamic insight into customer behavior, aiding in the formulation of effective strategies to drive sales and improve safety.},

Referring to the literature, various modeling languages can be used to model an IoRT-aware BP. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is among the most attractive and descriptive languages. However, the latter lacks a formal aspect, potentially leading to inconsistencies and ambiguities. Therefore, to effectively check an IoRT-aware BP modeled using BPMN, it seems relevant to cope with a consistent formalism (e.g., Petri Net (PN), Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), etc.), simplifying the process structure verification. From this perspective, we propose an approach that deals with DEVS formalism to check IoRT-aware BP structure (e.g., deadlock, loop, dead task, etc.). To evaluate the proposed approach, we consider a case study of IoRT-aware BP in agriculture by checking its process model structure. The findings show the effectiveness of our approach in capturing structure errors.},

This paper proposes a multi-fidelity surrogate model method based on HDMR-Kriging (MFS-HK) to predict aerodynamic characteristics of morphing craft quickly and accurately. First, two computational models of aerodynamic characteristics for morphing aircraft are obtained based on the parametric geometric model of morphing aircraft: one with high-fidelity and the other with low fidelity. Second, the low-fidelity aerodynamic characteristics surrogate model based on the HDMR-Kriging method is established. Furthermore, the multi-fidelity surrogate model is constructed based on the hybrid scaling function. MFS-HK can achieve fast and accurate global prediction of morphing aircraft’s aerodynamic characteristics. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are verified by analyzing the computational model of morphing aircraft aerodynamic characteristics.},

Within this framework, aspects such as estimated range and vehicle acceleration, among others, could be examined. The simulation helps to determine the ideal parameters of the powertrain during the design process before the prototype is implemented.

  abstract  = {Low Earth Orbit satellite communication has become an important part of the integrated network between earth and space, offering low-latency, seamless communication services that are available everywhere. Adopting a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach to digital design has grown in importance as a way to deal with the complexity of such a system and increase the effectiveness of system design. The paper presents the initial design of the LEO satellite communication system architecture and demonstrates how MBSE, using the System Modeling Language (SysML), can better comprehend and analyze the system's functionality and architecture, meet stakeholder requirements, and extend the model results to the full lifecycle of system development. MBSE-based development improves the model's consistency and reusability. Based on the analysis of the requirements of the LEO access network, bearer network, and core network, the design methods and ideas of models, including the core element model refinement, communication scenario use case and activity design, satellite communication payload logical architecture design, and SysML model integration simulation analysis. The results of these models can provide support for the architecture design and key technology verification of the LEO satellite communication system.},

Firstly, the ICEEMDAN decomposes the original PV power sequence into several modal components and permutation entropy (PE) is used to reconstruct data to decrease the computational complexity. Secondly, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to classify weather patterns based on reconstructed dataset. Finally, a PV power ensemble prediction model is constructed by combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with a self-attention mechanism integrated to achieve multi-scale feature fusion by effectively capturing both long-term dependencies and local features, and significantly improves the accuracy of PV power prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms individual models in PV power prediction, with more precise fitting performance across different time periods, confirming its effectiveness and reliability.},

  abstract  = {The punching industry (PI) remains largely dependent on unsustainable resource use in its manufacturing process, consuming finite materials. Evolving market needs for increased environmental sustainability in the PI causes punching companies to reevaluate their existing manufacturing processes. Considering this trend, this research explores the prerequisites for transitioning to circular business models (CBMs), a subset of sustainable business models, by using smart sensor technology (SST) supporting a sustainable manufacturing process (SMP). Prior research has shown that using different sensors pertaining punching tools and machines is prevalent. Standard parts in the punching tool itself address these challenges of an imprecise set-up of the punching tool on the punching machine resulting in process improvements and efficiency enhancements. Yet, no similar data-driven punching tool concepts have been installed highlighting the novelty. To address this gap, this study examines how data can be gathered and successfully utilized to support SMP fostering CBMs in the PI based on data-driven punching tools. Mixed methods are applied in a practice oriented project, involving a Swiss-based manufacturer. The results demonstrate several key drivers supporting SMPs enabled by data-driven punching tools. Future research should involve a larger number of interviews and further field testing to increase maturing SST data-driven punching tools.},

In contrast, we study the question of how to support MPST by using internal DSLs . Answering this question positively, this paper presents the mpst.embedded library: it leverages Scala’s lightweight form of dependent typing, called match types, to embed MPST directly into Scala.

However, accurate numerical simulations of flow boiling remain a challenge due to the accuracy of predictions and the difficulty of implementing phase change models. This paper presents a boiling phase-change model that is easy to implement and provides acceptable accuracy based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The model drives phase changes primarily based on deviations of the interfacial temperature above the saturation temperature, and the model takes into account vapor and liquid thermal conductivities and grid size. Furthermore, the phase change model is restricted to implementation in interface or liquid cells directly adjacent to pure gas cells. Various theoretical problems with analytic solutions, such as the one-dimensional Stefan problem, the sucking problem, the two-phase Stefan problems, and the bubble growth in superheated liquid, are used to validate the accuracy of the model. The results show that the proposed boiling phase change model is well adapted and provides good accuracy for various problems.},

The framework adopts incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) for addressing hazard variability, and promotes significant computational efficiency improvement for propagating epistemic uncertainties associated with the structural models. It utilizes both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction approaches, equipped with inverse mappings, to learn a functional between the input parameter space (e.g., the epistemic uncertainties of the structure) to the high-dimensional output space created through the IDA implementation across different ground motions and seismic intensity levels. Polynomial chaos expansion is adopted as the surrogate model to learn this functional in the reduced space. A nine-story steel moment-resisting frame with uncertain structural properties is used as a testbed. We select the seismic fragility curves as a measure of the structure’s seismic performance, since it provides an estimate of the probability of entering specified damage states for given levels of ground shaking.},

However, the substantial volume of data associated with point clouds presents numerous challenges, particularly in terms of high bandwidth consumption and large storage capacity. Despite various solutions proposed thus far, with a focus on point cloud compression, upsampling, and completion, these reconstruction-related methods continue to fall short in delivering high fidelity point cloud output. As a solution, in DiffPMAE , we propose an effective point cloud reconstruction architecture. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we combine Masked Autoencoder and Diffusion Model to remotely reconstruct point cloud data. By the nature of this reconstruction process, DiffPMAE can be extended to many related downstream tasks including point cloud compression, upsampling and completion. Leveraging ShapeNet-55 and ModelNet datasets with over 60000 objects, we validate the performance of DiffPMAE exceeding many state-of-the-art methods in terms of autoencoding and downstream tasks considered.

The findings reveal that the correlation between building shape and wind behaviors is strongest within a radius of 0.7 1.3H of the target building. Moreover, the study observes that building width, building projected width, frontal area, and shape coefficient can substantially affect indoor and outdoor ventilation potentials of the surrounding spaces, but the influence of these parameters significantly varies depending on the incident wind direction. Certain building typologies can increase the outdoor ventilation potential of the neighborhood by 10–20},

Practice exercises in VR can help learners develop practical skills safely and effectively. Furthermore, VR provides the ability to interact directly and receive immediate feedback, helping students better understand processes and techniques, thereby improving their skills. Using VR in training helps reduce costs associated with using and maintaining realistic mechanical equipment, and VR simulations can be used repeatedly without wear or damage. Besides, VR creates an engaging and interesting learning environment, enhancing students’ learning motivation as well as other communication methods. This technology also allows the organization of distance learning courses, helping students in different locations participate in training programs without having to move. The research focuses on understanding the application of VR technology research in mechanical engineering training. The research results solve limitations in mechanical engineering training.

Shifting towards a more resilient and sustainable industry to tackle today’s challenges, like climate change and the global food and water supply, cannot be solved through siloed systems. It requires a paradigm shift towards coopetition and knowledge sharing of larger systems. The Industrial Metaverse (IMV) integrates the physical and digital space into interconnected Virtual Environments (VEs) based on Digital Twin models to exchange data and knowledge, representing an accessible meta-ecosystem. While the IMV’s enabling technologies are well explored, the interdependencies between its ecosystems and network effects, including interoperability of identities and tokenized assets, of all participating systems to achieve a unified experience and decentralized digital economy in the application layer remain fuzzy. Following these issues, we discuss the IMV platform ecosystem architecture as a system of systems for exchanging and sharing resources. In particular, we investigate system interoperable, decentralized orchestration and governance mechanisms for regulation compliance, data privacy, and access control that, if unresolved, may discourage institutions from participating. Additionally, we outline the general capabilities of the IMV’s application layer and its relation to the ecosystem methodology as an asset-heavy industrial platform. Furthermore, we discuss the most promising use case categories for VEs in the IMV, such as interoperable assets, hyper customization, and cross-collaboration within industrial production processes embedded in a digital economy of enterprise creators and communicating systems.},

To improve indoor comfort, architects focus mainly on the structure and type of the building during the schematic design phase and try to save as much energy as possible on the surrounding environment. In this study, a traditional single atrium layout was compared to a multiple atrium configuration to assess their respective effects on the indoor thermal environment. Simulation software was used to calculate the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Predicted Percentage Dissatisfaction (PPD) indices using subjective assessments and physical measurements. The index is a comprehensive evaluation index that considers many factors related to human thermal comfort, starting from the basic equations of human heat balance and the psychophysiological rating of subjective thermal sensations. The results show that for most of the indicators, the building is more suitable for a multi-atrium layout. Improvements in the thermal environment were not significant in winter, but in summer, indoor thermal comfort was better in multi-atrium office buildings than in single-atrium office buildings in most climatic zones. Further exploration of the multi-atrium configuration reveals that the increase in atriums introduces more natural ventilation and natural light, significantly improving the indoor thermal environment and reducing energy consumption.},

By analyzing MAR characteristics, we construct a user mental model based on “execution" and “evaluation" dimensions alongside six attributes, guiding MAR interaction design. Methods: We analyze MAR traits like interactivity, information display, and physical comfort, deriving two dimensions (execution and evaluation) and six attributes (usage habits, information attention, interactive behavior, usage experience, cognitive experience, and workload). Through user interviews and affinity diagrams, we construct the mental model. To demonstrate its practical application, we utilize a MAR exhibition with a miniature model theme. Results: Through case application and user testing, we validate the effectiveness of the mental model-driven design in enhancing MAR interaction. Users perceive improvements in ease of use, learnability, and satisfaction with systems designed using this approach. Conclusion: This study underscores the value of leveraging user mental models rooted in “execution" and “evaluation" dimensions to guide MAR system design.

The model cascades across 38 Provinces (Level 2), 514 Regencies (Level 3), 7,277 Districts (Level 4), and 83,763 Villages (Level 5). Each administrative layer functions as an edge server, designed to improve latency, bandwidth utilization, and cache efficiency. This journal evaluates the performance metrics, including Time-to-Live (TTL) settings, Cache Hit Ratio (CHR), Throughput, Latency, and Bandwidth Consumption at each hierarchical level. Findings suggest that the pull caching model enhances content accessibility, reduces data transfer load from higher-level servers, and optimizes end-user experiences in decentralized regions.},

Green building, a novel paradigm in construction development, has emerged as a pivotal trend within the global construction sector. The advent of information technology has precipitated a transformation in the construction industry’s management paradigm, propelling it towards a data-driven and collaborative approach that encompasses the entire lifecycle. Notably, Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology has emerged as a pivotal catalyst for innovation in green building design and management models. This study explores the application of BIM technology in green building design and analyses how it can improve the energy efficiency, resource utilisation and environmental performance of building design through information technology. Using a hospital project in Yunnan as a case study, the research demonstrates how BIM technology can be used to optimise building energy simulation, environmental impact assessment, energy-saving measures and intelligent management. The findings of the case study demonstrate that BIM technology has the capacity to optimise the design decision-making process, to achieve refined control during the construction and operation and maintenance stages. The research results provide both theoretical and practical support for the transformation of the construction industry’s information technology and innovation of management models, and help to achieve the goal of sustainable development in the construction industry.},

  abstract  = {Several software businesses Over the past twenty years, one of the most contentious themes among researchers has been agile software development approaches. They are known as light weight development approaches due to their flexible, informal, and adaptable methodology. The foundation of these models is an assortment of optimal methodologies that facilitate the resolution of issues pertaining to evolving specifications, client contentment, and merchandise excellence. There are several agile models available to suit the requirements of various projects. Nonetheless, the two most well-known and frequently applied models are Extreme Programming and Scrum. This study contributes much by thoroughly examining these models. This study compares Extreme Programming with Scrum in-depth in order to identify their shared and unique characteristics as well as their complementary aspects. The practice of estimating software effort is a crucial and indispensable aspect of any software project. Project success or failure is largely determined, among other things, by how accurately effort and schedule are estimated. Agile approaches’ introduction into the software development industry has brought both possibilities and difficulties for scholars and practitioners. An important problem in agile software development is estimating work. Agile software projects use traditional methods for estimating effort, however these methods typically produce estimates that are not accurate. The creation of an effort estimation model for agile software projects is the main goal of this study. A detailed explanation of the model's construction and use is provided. Abstract should summarize the contents of the paper in short terms, i.e. 15–250 words.},

Although the threat of AI-generated content in such attacks is growing, current training methods predominantly rely on simplistic human-designed emails. This research introduces a novel experimental paradigm to investigate differences in the detection of human-generated versus AI-generated phishing emails, as well as two different methods by which cyberattackers could use AI as a tool to generate phishing emails. Our behavioral results reveal that emails co-created by humans and Generative-AI models pose a greater challenge to end users compared to emails created by GPT-4 or Humans working alone. We also propose a cognitive model that predicts user behavior during training, which offers the potential to be used in future user training to improve training outcomes. Our work contributes by (1) identifying critical weaknesses in current social engineering training, (2) describing biases that human participants demonstrate when viewing GPT-4 written content in emails, and (3) proposing a cognitive model-driven solution to better train users against evolving threats.},

  abstract  = {The Digital Twin concept involves the transition to digital representations of factory floor equipment, the computerized simulation of processes and the visualization of data in real time. This type of digital transformations can be considered radical, encountering barriers in its implementation either due to resistance to change by the different elements that make up the industry or due to the disruption it can cause in the production process. The start of production on an assembly line is usually preceded by a checking procedure of parameters/conditions of the equipment present on the assembly line, using a sheet of paper containing the list of items to check and validate. In this article we describe the adoption of a paperless checklist to verify the configuration of assembly line equipment at production bootstrapping. A training program to coach the employees for a successful digital transition is also presented and discussed. Both the digital checklist and the training program are validated in a real-world industrial scenario. The results highlight the advantages of the digital approach given to the checklist with a multi-access viewing and maintenance of data for later analysis, with the training plan demonstrating effectiveness in breaking down barriers and resistance to the adoption of a new working method.},

It consists of three modules, document image augmentation and feature extraction, sequence modeling and contextual information learning, and the robust document image dewarping. In particular, given a distorted document image, we first extract its deep convolution features, outputting a group of down-sampled feature maps. Each feature map is flatten into a vector, and a document sequence is built by all these feature vectors. The contextual information hidden in the sequence are learned by using the Selective State Space Sequence Model. That is, sequence-to-sequence transformations are performed based on the Mamba2 blocks. All sequences are then reshaped to updated feature maps and further encoded by using the dilated convolution layers. Finally, the original feature maps and the final feature maps are adding together and fed into a rectification decoder to estimate a coarse backward mapping. The final rectified image is achieved by performing the up-sampled backward mapping on the original distorted image. Extensive experiments conducted on the DocUNet and DIR300 benchmarks showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {As the scale and complexity of software in the aerospace industry exponentially increase, airborne systems are experiencing a continuous rise in the number of system design defects and frequency of software rework. A significant portion of these defects are exposed during the integration and testing phases of software and hardware, leading to high cost and schedule overruns in the development and delivery of systems. The traditional development process is being challenged due to the limited ability to build safe aircraft. Exploring cost-effective and affordable solutions, and shifting risks forward to earlier phases of the system development lifecycle are critical issues. Recently, model-based system engineering has gradually been applied in the development of airborne systems, and Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is widely used to model and analyze airborne systems. To combine the analysis activities and system development process, however, is quite limited. In this paper, considering the system development process and existing analysis method, a mixed-fidelity modeling and analysis method via system architecture is proposed. The AADL model is an Authoritative Source of Truth (ASOT) of the analytic model. And an architecture-centric approach is adopted to model and analyze embedded systems at different levels of fidelity with respect to quality attributes such as performance, safety, reliability, etc. An example is given for demonstrating how to apply this method. The practical application results show significant contributions to discovering system design defects earlier in the design phase and reducing risk, cost, and development cycle.},

Currently, the accuracy of common commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices still typically ranges from meters, which proves insufficient for most vehicular safety applications. Therefore, a method to improve this accuracy is needed. In addition, GNSS accuracy varies depending on the technology used by each specific device carried by road users, making implementing GNSS accuracy enhancement at the device level less feasible. This paper proposes a centralized system leveraging Kalman Filters to enhance the accuracy of heterogeneous devices.

Image schemas, important concepts in cognitive science, are used to explain and understand certain patterns and structures in human thinking. This article aims to analyze the current research status of image schemas through scientometric analysis and to review the literature to understand their application in the field of design, providing a reference for further research into their feasibility in design. The research method involves a scientometric analysis of 921 academic publications related to image schemas from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 1996 to 2023. Utilizing ‘CiteSpace,’ co-occurrence networks are identified and visualized, and cluster analysis of primary research categories and timelines is conducted to describe the knowledge landscape. Additionally, a literature review on the application of image schemas in the design field is further conducted. The results indicate that the number of papers related to image schemas is rapidly increasing and that image schemas hold significant potential for development in the design domain. The connection between image schemas and the design field primarily focuses on conceptual metaphor, memory, representation, and other aspects, with notable advantages in visual, experiential, and interactive domains. In conclusion, research related to image schemas in the design field is gradually progressing, and its significance in promoting human-centered design development is noteworthy, warranting broader and deeper research efforts.},

  abstract  = {Combinatorial testing (CT) is an efficient and effective black-box testing technology, combinining mathematically guaranteed input space coverage with comparatively small test sets. However, it requires a current and complete model of all input parameters to a system under test (SUT), their respective value domains, and any constraints between parameters. This factor greatly hinders the adoption of CT in real-world development settings, as creating and maintaining an input parameter model requires signficant effort and is often not sufficiently integrated into relevant workflows in the face of software evolution. To alleviate this drawback, we propose an annotation-based method that aims to improve the locality of model information. It allows developers to define parameter values as well as constraints in immediate vicinity to function or method definitions, enabling them to incorporate modeling into their workflows with minimal overhead. Required oracles are implemented following a common structure and interface, permitting flexible evaluation of results while retaining low complexity for common cases. By incorporating the automated generation and execution of combinatorial test sets into continuous integration processes, our method streamlines the practical application of CT and thus aims to facilitate the industrial adoption of this high-assurance testing approach. A practical implementation targeting the Kotlin programming language serves as the basis for our evaluation, which verifies the applicability of our method when incorporated into an existing medium-sized codebase. At the same time, it offers directions for future work, including improvements regarding stateful testing in object-oriented languages.},

After reviewing literature on metaverse retailing, channel strategies, VR/AR technologies, and user experiences, a conceptual framework was developed. Data from the “Voice of the Consumer: Digital Survey” (2020–2024) in over 20 countries was analyzed, using Pearson’s correlation, factor analysis, and multiple linear regressions. The results point that key challenges for VR/AR adoption include security, privacy, content, price, headset-free experiences, digital fatigue, and poor experiences. Gaming is the most common VR/AR activity, while metaverse retailing activities like shopping and virtual try-ons have fewer users. Practical considerations drive metaverse retailing, unlike gaming, which is mainly hedonic. Privacy concerns, safety risks, poor experiences, and lack of knowledge surprisingly increase VR/AR usage for metaverse retailing, indicating informed consumers or threshold characterization of these variables. Additional insights were found for tourism, hospitality, and gaming activities. Theoretical implications, insights, and potential actions for retailers and tech companies are discussed, along with limitations and suggestions for further research.},

  abstract  = {Nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvesters (NPEHs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their wide harvesting bandwidth and high harvesting efficiency. Due to the complexity of NPEHs, researchers usually use theoretical numerical and experiments to analyze. However, two problems prevent us from more accurate analysis and design. Firstly, the common magnetic model named magnetic dipole model (MDM) will usually cause an unacceptable error in NPEHs; secondly, the harmonic balance method (HBM) which usually only uses the first-order harmonic terms is accurate in the monostable configuration for low-amplitude vibrations, but for the bistable or multi-stable ones, this method has major differences compared to numerical methods such as sweep method (SM) or experiment. To solve the above two problems, we propose a more accurate magnetic model based on the MDM to reduce the error. Meanwhile, we use the swarm intelligent optimization algorithm (SIOA) to solve the high-dimensional nonlinear algebraic equations obtained by high order HBM, which is in agreement with the SM, and find out more nonlinear dynamical phenomena. What’s more, the high-energy orbital solutions which can be easily neglected in the SM and experiment but have significant advantages to energy harvesting have been found.},

  abstract  = {Existing image deraining methods often rely on synthetic data, but the domain gap between synthetic and real data causes significant performance degradation in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Cross-Domain Attention-Guided domain adaptive deraining network (CDAG-network) that learns rainfall characteristics from both synthetic and real data to achieve better generalizability. Firstly, we introduce cross-attention as a fine-grained domain adaptation constraint into the CDAG-network, to enhance its capability in analyzing features from real and synthetic domains and aligning their distributions. Secondly, in light of the complex nature of rain artifacts, we propose the Mixed-Scale Convolutional Transformer (MSCT) block that effectively captures features from both global and local perspectives and improves the spatial perception of the model. With the two key designs, the CDAG-network demonstrates enhanced efficiency in domain adaptation and degradation modeling. Furthermore, we present a novel model for synthesizing rain images, which more accurately emulates rain effects in real-world scenes. Based on this model, we synthesize 9K synthetic rain images that along with 6K real rain images collected from real scenes constitute a new domain adaptive deraining dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in real-world rain removal task.},

In this paper, based on the transient dynamics explicit integration algorithm and finite element analysis method, finite element analysis is carried out to analyse the nonlinear process of the structural deformation of the support member in the crash. The results show that the peak acceleration at the centre of the floor can be reduced by reducing the thickness of the strut to improve its crashworthiness. The width of the edge strip of the brace and the angle of the outer support of the brace have little effect on the deformation of the bottom of the fuselage and the peak acceleration at the centre of the floor.},

We propose to formalise the concrete interaction rules as natural transformations, called coordination laws , and embed these specifications into a bialgebraic representation based on multi-sorted algebraic signatures. If the coordination laws can be transformed into an abstract GSOS format, the approach is compositional, i.e. syntactical operations on the individual components are fully abstract w.r.t. bisimilarity. We obtain resulting operational semantics as a holistic coalgebra, which comprises the behaviour of the individual components and the resulting global behaviour. This guarantees non-intrusiveness for the individual components and, furthermore, enables successive coordination steps building on each other by taking the individual components as initial input and yielding an ultimate compound behaviour as final output.},

The results revealed that the decision-makers seemed to spend more time, attention and cognitive effort on the screen declared as preferred. In addition, it is suggested that, in one of the interfaces, the change in the arrangement of the data on the graph resulted in an increase in the demand for the task, suggesting an increase in task time, duration of fixation and pupil diameter.

  abstract  = {The video games industry reached a revenue of US$455.27 billion in 2024 [ 6 ], with Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) as the figurehead. However, this industry, which depends on user satisfaction, is threatened by cheating actions degrading the gaming experience. Cheaters can exploit the distributed nature of MOGs with network flow disruption attacks, manipulating the network to disrupt game synchronization. Detecting those attacks is challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between instabilities and latency inherent in the network and artificial manipulations. This paper proposes a framework that game developers can integrate into their games to generate data that helps understand whether it is possible to differentiate between honest and cheating behaviors. The framework enables developers to automate the execution of network flow disruption cheats in their MOG environment and incorporates a logging mechanism to record both cheating and honest behaviors. The framework is implemented within the game engine, making it generic to different MOGs. Early results of the generated data are presented, highlighting the effects of network flow disruption attacks on MOGs.},

  abstract  = {Wave-induced ship heave and roll motions pose great challenges for the design of control systems of dual ship-mounted cranes (DSCs) along with complicated nonlinearities and physical constraints. Aiming at the above issues, this paper establishes the dynamic model of DSCs subject to ship roll and heave motions and proposes a nonlinear coordinated stabilizing controller which could achieve precise positioning and swing-elimination. First, the DSCs dynamic model considering ship roll and heave motions is built by utilizing the Lagrange method. On the basis of the dynamic model, the system energy function consisting of the kinetic and potential energy is introduced. With the first-order derivation of the energy function, explicit expressions of ship-to-ship interaction forces caused by ship motions are derived. These forces are then incorporated into the controller to mitigate the effects between the two ships, thereby achieving coordinated control of the two cranes during payload transportation. Lyapunov techniques are used to rigorously prove the stability of the control system. Finally, numerous simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract  = {In introductory programming courses in higher education, systematic problem-solving consists of three interdependent steps: 1) the specification of the task, 2) the algorithm of the solving program, and 3) the implementation of the algorithm. During the specification phase, numerous decisions are made that help to describe subsequent steps, making specification a crucial stage in the design process, mainly when we use stricter analogous programming approaches, like derivation. However, the formal language used for the specification requires a considerable level of abstraction, so in practice this part of the task solution is often incomplete or incorrect from students. In this article, we aim to explore the challenges associated with the specification step in introductory programming courses in higher education. Additionally, we introduce a tool designed to alleviate these issues and elevate the specification process to the same level of experience as writing algorithms and code during problem solving.},

An improved controller design approach is proposed in the context of CAVs with second-order models and HDVs with intelligent driver models (IDM). This enables CAVs to not only maintain following behavior with the vehicle ahead but also actively guide the rear vehicle's movement, which improves the previous state where the CAVs only take the role of followers. We first construct a mixed vehicle formation model to convert the formation control problem into a leader-following consensus problem, after which we design a control protocol and solve the formation consensus problem using state linear transformation and partial stability theory. Finally, the solution method of the gain matrix in the control protocol is given, and the effectiveness and superiority of the controller are verified through simulation.},

  abstract  = {The deployment of wind power plants equipped with energy storage systems is expected to mitigate the variability of wind power outputs. When these wind-storage units are encouraged to participate in the day-ahead (DA) electricity market as price-makers, their offering strategies will not only affect the market prices, but also be influenced by the bidding strategies of other market participants. In this context, a bi-level model considering strategic interactions between the wind-storage unit and other market participants in the DA market is proposed, aiming to investigate the impacts of the strategic interaction on the offering strategy and energy storage utilization of the wind-storage unit. At the upper-level, each market participant decides its offering strategy to maximize its own profit. At the lower level, the independent system operator (ISO) performs the DA market clearing to maximize social welfare. Then, the bi-level model is transformed into a single-level equilibrium problem and can be solved by using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and nonlinear complementarity methods. Finally, the model’s reasonableness and effectiveness are verified through case studies. It is shown that the wind-storage unit’s strategic interaction with other market participants can help improve the utilization of energy storage and achieve higher profit.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of aerospace products, with an increasing number of components, more demanding delivery times, and reduced costs, is leading companies to look for integrated management systems. The future of the aerospace industry is linked to the development of new methodologies, such as Model-Based Engineering (MBE). In the last two decades, the use of semantic structures, such as ontological models, to improve information systems has proven to be very effective in the industry. Models for Manufacturing (MfM) is a recent OBE (Ontology- Based Engineering) methodology for defining complex manufacturing systems’ data, functions, and behaviours using graphical models. It is based on agnostic tools and is structured in an architecture of three independent layers. In this paper, the MfM methodology is applied to describe the manufacturing process of Aerospace Sheet Metal (ASM) parts. The implementation is described through a practical example for a part manufactured with one of the most used sheet metal forming processes in the aerospace industry: hydroforming. A study analysed 26 typical sheet metal parts, finding bending and hydroforming to be the main processes. The model aims to characterize the forming process, i.e., to recognize the most appropriate manufacturing process, and subsequently to define the necessary operations and resources, based on the part’s Computer Aided-Design model. In addition, the model is complemented by other existing MfM tools for sheet metal forming.},

The method combines the time variation corresponding to the same current during charging, the time variation corresponding to the same voltage during discharging, and the moment movement characteristics corresponding to the temperature peak, and utilizes Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to study the linear correlation relationship between the multiple factors and the battery life degradation, and combines with the empirical model of linear regression to achieve a more accurate prediction of the battery life.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Extensible Document Parsing Structure Framework based on Font-Aware (EDPS-FA), which innovatively integrates Font-Aware semantic analysis with multimodal fusion to enhance parsing accuracy and robustness. The framework introduces three key innovations: (1) The Font-Aware Box Selection (FABS) that resolves layout parsing ambiguities, including in complete boundary recognition and accurate partition, through typographical feature extraction. (2) The Font-Aware Paragraph Extraction (FAPE) can accurately identify and analyze the cross-page paragraph information. (3) The Textual Tree JSON Reconstruction (TTJR) that extends conventional JSON-based structural representations by incorporating font-semantic relationships, enabling adaptive hierarchical reconstruction. At the same time, the optimal comparison enhancer (OCE) can optimize the analytical output through the multi-criteria alignment iteration method. Implemented with intelligent web-based parsing and batch processing capabilities, EDPS-FA demonstrates efficacy in processing structurally complex medical documents. Experimental validation through comparative and ablation studies achieved an F1-score of 90},

  abstract  = {Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is a commonly used tool for stroke diagnosis, and accurate segmentation of cerebral vessels based on CTP images is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients. However, the complex tree-like structure of cerebral vessels and inhomogeneous diffusion of contrast agents during dynamic imaging pose significant challenges to manual segmentation or the establishment of supervised automatic segmentation models. This research presents a multi-statistical features-based 4D level set model (MSF-4DLSM), which requires no labeled training samples while achieving segmentation accuracy comparable to fully supervised models. First, the temporal dimension information of the CTP image is introduced into the level set through the variance map to construct a 4D level set combining temporal and spatial features. Then, in the evolution term of the model, a mixed image of the fixed-point enhanced temporal variance map and the spatiotemporal mean map is used to replace the basic variance map, which improves the model’s adaptability to the uneven diffusion of contrast agents. Finally, to improve the continuity of the vessel segmentation results, we added optical flow information to the model evolution term. The proposed method was validated on 50 CTP images, and achieved an encouraging performance, with Dice, Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and Jaccard of 0.90, 0.92, 0.94, 0.99 and 0.85, respectively. The results are close to those of the supervised model U-Net (Dice: 0.91, Sensitivity: 0.93; Specificity: 0.95; Accuracy: 0.99; Jaccard: 0.87).},

  abstract  = {The transition to green industrial policies has become a global imperative as countries strive to achieve sustainable economic growth parallel to a reduction of environmental externalities. Developing countries face unique challenges in adopting green industrial policy, as they are latecomers to industrialization and must balance economic growth with stringent environmental controls. This study aims to gain insights into the progression of publications on green industrialization in developing countries and identify key themes and research gaps. By using a systematic-cum-bibliometric review, the study identified publication trends, influential articles and research themes. The analysis of the merged dataset of 539 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases revealed a notable increase in publications from 2014 to 2022, driven by the momentum of the Paris Climate Agreement. China emerged as a leading country in green industrial policy research, followed by the UK and the USA. The University of Sussex and Tsinghua University demonstrated significant contributions to the field. We identified six themes which offer valuable insights for adopting environmentally friendly policies while fostering economic growth and inclusivity. Targeted subsidies, technological innovation and collaboration are vital to accelerate the transition to green industrialization. Research gaps remain particularly in integrating the informal sector into green economies, harmonizing climate policies with international trade rules and understanding the impact of digital technology on green industrialization in developing countries. The findings have crucial implications for policymakers, researchers and stakeholders aiming to promote green industrial policies and sustainable development. The study calls for further research to expand the scope of data sources beyond Scopus and Web of Science to Google Scholar and Dimensions to enhance the breadth of knowledge in this field.},

As actors, services, and user interfaces are increasingly interconnected and nontransparent within these ecosystems, traditional disciplinary and existing interdisciplinary methods from the realms of information systems and law become insufficient to cope with the extent and pace of change. To address this challenge, this paper follows a design science research approach to develop a novel method for ecosystem-architecture guided regulatory reasoning. This method is intended to be more collaborative, interdisciplinary, and agile to enable regulatory reasoning in the digital age. By enabling the systematic decomposition of ecosystem architectures, our method helps researchers and practitioners gain transparency about ecosystems and their various interfaces, identify legal issues, and derive policy implications to adjust laws. The paper demonstrates the method based on the Google News ecosystem and discusses identified legal issues in terms of the Interstate Media Treaty.},

  abstract  = {Architecture has evolved continuously, aligning itself with the evolving needs and desires of society. The idea of interactive architecture emerged with the development of technologies and increment in environmental, functional, and human problems. Interactive architecture refers to the architecture which can change, adapt, and reconfigure to the needs of users and the environment in real time. A Space’s Interaction, flexibility, and integration both with the environment and individuals can be done with the help of IoT, artificial intelligence, sensors, actuators, etc. This research paper aims to explore diverse ways and potential in interactive architecture in responding to user needs and environmental dynamics. In the Indian context, the application of interactive architecture is limited, and embracing it will ensure innovation, efficiency, and enhanced user experience. We shouldn’t lag in the global evolution of design, adopting these advancements aligns with progress and enriches our built environment. To understand the user-centric perspective, a questionnaire survey (primary) was conducted involving 204 participants along with interviews (secondary). The study encompasses respondents of multiple disciplines, ranging from architects, architecture students, data science students, educators, and others to provide comprehensive insights. The finding of the paper presents that interactive architecture has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. Also, there are challenges like high cost, complex technology, and lack of understanding and awareness among the public. In conclusion, this research advances the existing theoretical discourse on interactive architecture and offers more practical insights for architects and other stakeholders in shaping the built environment.},

  abstract  = {Recovering the camera motion and scene geometry from visual data is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Its success in conventional (frame-based) vision is attributed to the maturity of feature extraction, data association and multi-view geometry. The emergence of asynchronous (event-based) cameras calls for new approaches that use raw event data as input to solve this fundamental problem. State-of-the-art solutions typically infer data association implicitly by iteratively reversing the event data generation process. However, the nonlinear nature of these methods limits their applicability in real-time tasks, and the constant-motion assumption leads to unstable results under agile motion. To this end, we reformulate the problem in a way that aligns better with the differential working principle of event cameras. We show that event-based normal flow can be used, via the proposed geometric error term, as an alternative to the full (optical) flow in solving a family of geometric problems that involve instantaneous first-order kinematics and scene geometry. Furthermore, we develop a fast linear solver and a continuous-time nonlinear solver on top of the proposed geometric error term. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the superiority of our linear solver in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and its practicality as an initializer for previous nonlinear solvers. Besides, our continuous-time non-linear solver exhibits exceptional capabilities in accommodating sudden variations in motion since it does not rely on the constant-motion assumption.

  abstract  = {Most current single image-deraining (SID) methods are based on the Transformer with global modeling for high-quality reconstruction. However, their architectures only build long-range features from the spatial domain, which suffers from a significant computational burden to keep effectiveness. Besides, these methods either overlook negative sample information in training or underutilize the rain streak patterns present in the negative ones. To tackle these problems, we propose a Frequency-Aware Deraining Transformer Framework (FADformer) that fully captures frequency domain features for efficient rain removal. Specifically, we construct the FADBlock, including the Fused Fourier Convolution Mixer (FFCM) and Prior-Gated Feed-forward Network (PGFN). Unlike self-attention mechanisms, the FFCM conducts convolution operations in both spatial and frequency domains, endowing it with local-global capturing capabilities and efficiency. Simultaneously, the PGFN introduces residue channel prior in a gating manner to enhance local details and retain feature structure. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-domain Contrastive Regularization (FCR) during training. The FCR facilitates contrastive learning in the frequency domain and leverages rain streak patterns in negative samples to improve performance. Extensive experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of our FADformer. The source code is available at https://github.com/deng-ai-lab/FADformer .},

Food systems are essential for the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in China. Here, using an integrated assessment modelling framework that considers country-specific pathways and covers 18 indicators, we find that most social and environmental targets for the Chinese food system under current trends are not aligned with the United Nations Agenda 2030. We further quantify the impacts of multiple measures, revealing potential trade-offs in pursuing strategies aimed at public health, environmental sustainability and livelihood improvement in isolation. Among the individual packages of measures, a shift towards healthy diets exhibits the lowest level of trade-offs, leading to improvements in nutrition, health, environment and livelihoods. In contrast, focusing efforts on climate change mitigation and ecological conservation, or promoting faster socioeconomic development alone, have trade-offs between social and environmental outcomes. These trade-offs could be minimized by bundling all three aspects of measures.},

  abstract  = {Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with broad applications. However, existing works often simplify this task within the context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting surface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization (ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image restoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution dataset Ambient6K , comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend , a novel strong baseline that maximizes I mage- F requency joint entropy to selectively restore local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow localization priors. Experiments show that IFBlend achieves SOTA scores on Ambient6K and exhibits competitive performance on conventional shadow removal benchmarks compared to shadow-specific models with mask priors. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend .},

  abstract  = {Image restoration aims to enhance low-quality images, producing high-quality images that exhibit natural visual characteristics and fine semantic attributes. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful technique for image generation, and it has been explicitly employed as a backbone in image restoration tasks, yielding excellent results. However, it suffers from the drawbacks of slow inference speed and large model parameters due to its intrinsic characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that implicitly leverages the diffusion model to assist the training of image restoration network, called DiffLoss, which drives the restoration results to be optimized for naturalness and semantic-aware visual effect. To achieve this, we utilize the mode coverage capability of the diffusion model to approximate the distribution of natural images and explore its ability to capture image semantic attributes. On the one hand, we extract intermediate noise to leverage its modeling capability of the distribution of natural images, which serves as a naturalness-oriented optimization space. On the other hand, we utilize the bottleneck features of diffusion model to harness its semantic attributes serving as a constraint on semantic level. By combining these two designs, the overall loss function is able to improve the perceptual quality of image restoration, resulting in visually pleasing and semantically enhanced outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the visual quality and semantic perception of the restoration network.

The method leverages the powerful representation of word embeddings through an evolutionary algorithm, focusing on classification tasks. EBIE monitors shifts in individual embedding dimensions over generations and, by tracking these dimensional changes, identifies which parts of the embedding are most responsive to changes performed by genetic operations. These insights reveal critical features that influence model decisions and expose latent biases embedded within NLP classifiers. Through correlation analysis between individual tokens and classification scores, EBIE uncovers systematic biases in model behavior, such as reliance on stereotypical markers and neglect of nuanced expressions. By uncovering these tendencies, our methodology provides actionable insights to refine model training, enhance fairness, and improve robustness. Its flexibility ensures broad applicability across various NLP tasks, offering a powerful and versatile framework for developing more equitable and transparent machine learning systems.},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {Natural images can suffer from various degradation phenomena caused by adverse atmospheric conditions or unique degradation mechanism. Such diversity makes it challenging to design a universal framework for kinds of restoration tasks. Instead of exploring the commonality across different degradation phenomena, existing image restoration methods focus on the modification of network architecture under limited restoration priors. In this work, we first review various degradation phenomena from a frequency perspective as prior. Based on this, we propose an efficient image restoration framework, dubbed SFHformer, which incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform mechanism into Transformer architecture. Specifically, we design a dual domain hybrid structure for multi-scale receptive fields modeling, in which the spatial domain and the frequency domain focuses on local modeling and global modeling, respectively. Moreover, we design unique positional coding and frequency dynamic convolution for each frequency component to extract rich frequency-domain features. Extensive experiments on thirty-one restoration datasets for a range of ten restoration tasks such as deraining, dehazing, deblurring, desnowing, denoising, super-resolution and underwater/low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our SFHformer surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance, parameter size and computational cost.

  year      = {2025},

  publisher = {Springer},
  abstract  = {Multicollinearity (MC) occurs when various variables in a multiple linear regression analysis are substantially correlated, not only with the response variable, but also with each other. Due to MC, several of the relevant variables under investigation become statistically insignificant. Conversely, overfitting occurs when the model fits the training set too closely, resulting in unwanted data being captured instead of the patterns that lie beneath. This research addresses three basic strategies for finding MC in thyroid disease dataset. The RE estimator (RE) is compared with principal component analysis (PCA) and also compared with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), and the results are summarized. Principal components are used by PCA to represent the data instead of performing explicit feature selection (FS). Since these elements are only linear combinations of the original traits, it could be difficult to see how they contribute. A small number of factors are chosen by the PCA with the help of information gain at an acceptable level of p -values of 0.4 and below. With p -values of 0.5 and lower, the RE automatically chooses factors. With more acceptable p -values, like 0.03, 0.02, and 0.007, and so forth, the Lasso automatically chooses factors. RE and Lasso have chosen a log lambda of 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, to resolve MC. The resolution of MC for the RE and PCA is 0.49 and 0.51, respectively. The RE incorporates all of the model’s properties while penalizing the coefficients to keep them from growing excessively. The Lasso model drives some coefficients absolutely to zero in order to carry out automatic FS. It offers a limited collection of chosen features with nonzero coefficients, making it possible to create a more understandable model that concentrates on the most significant predictors. But we can use RR to choose the model’s more salient features. On the other hand, a preferable alternative is to utilize Lasso to choose the model’s minimum number of salient features. In contrast, MC resolution and FS can be handled concurrently by RE and Lasso. But the PCA was not the best choice for FS in parallel; it was only better at resolving MC.},

  abstract  = {Data collection, particularly ground-truth generation, is crucial for developing computer vision models used for construction progress monitoring applications. The performance of such models relies heavily on the quality of the data, which drives the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms. If data is not collected and subsequently managed correctly, the algorithms will fail, and the applicability of these models for construction monitoring applications will be degraded. In the absence of quality data, synthetic image generation using BIM has been widely studied to resolve data insufficiency issues. Because of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world images, most recent works have focused on rendering techniques to enhance the realism of lighting and texture. However, the impact of extrinsic camera parameters, which directly influence how BIM elements are rendered in camera views, is heavily underexplored. This leads to an over-utilization of weakly created synthetic ground-truth images. As a result, these images and their often-random camera position and viewpoints fail to reflect real-world visual perspectives needed for enterprise-grade solutions for monitoring construction progress. To improve the quality of synthetic construction environment datasets, this paper explores the integration of per-element visibility metrics to understand how different positional camera parameters impact the synthetic data collection pipeline and segmentation model performance improvement. This work is validated by comparing real-image segmentation accuracy through experiments using visibility metrics from different camera positions and directions. Finally, a discussion of how positional camera parameters can be selected for producing a more efficient and less biased synthetic dataset is presented.},

To explore more practical and efficient teaching methods, we integrated the OBE and PBL concepts and implemented reforms in terms of teaching objectives, curriculum content, assessment methods, and teaching methodologies.

  abstract  = {Methods, incl. modeling methods, are important for designing innovations. They (should) provide hands-on guidance for creating outcomes in a systematic way using certain techniques. These techniques need to be understood, (correctly) applied, and possibly also selected as well as arranged. Previous research called for more studies on the ‘presentation formats’ supporting these tasks, specifically for practitioners. This is especially relevant for the early stage of innovation projects. Here, business stakeholders with different disciplinary backgrounds engage in collaborative design who are not accustomed to, e.g., formalized notations. For this context, we develop support for understanding, selecting, arranging, and applying modeling techniques. Following the design science research paradigm, we develop the presentation format of a two-page diagram brief. The development of this artifact is informed by the established format of design cards as well as knowledge from research in enterprise modeling and situational method engineering. A brief is centered around one or few closely related diagrams and provides information structured along nine categories which are identical for all briefs. For example, briefs provide outcome creation and usage instructions, excerpts from a stakeholder perspective catalog, and quality criteria. The brief design is demonstrated through 18 briefs for strategy, organization, and high-level information technology design and evaluated with survey data (n = 88). Our research contributes a template for researchers, instructors, and practitioners to support lightweight, collaborative modeling by non-experts (i.e., grass-roots modeling) in the early stage of innovation projects.},

A work system perspective can address those issues by serving as an integrating nexus between disciplines and between IS modeling traditions while also bridging gaps between rigor and broad usability in IS modeling. The work system perspective provides a natural nexus at many areas of overlap between disciplines that focus on systems designed and operated to achieve goals.

  abstract  = {Although several methodologies, processes, and frameworks are available for constructing sophisticated autonomous multiagent systems organizations, none of them provide techniques for the reliability analysis of multiagent systems designs. This is an important issue when designing a multiagent system because of the nature of the environments where it operates (dynamic, continuous, and partially accessible). Additionally, the multiagent system must be adaptive (self-organized) to adjust its behavior to cope with the dynamic appearance and disappearance of goals (tasks), their given guidelines, and the overall goal of the multiagent system. To address such an issue, we propose a novel approach for computing the reliability, in design time, of organization-based multiagent systems. This process consists of five steps. First, the multi-agent system is designed by adopting a modified version of the OMACS framework. Second, such a design is transformed into a P-graph model to take advantage of the combinatorial nature of the underlying structure. Third, algorithm SSG of the P-graph framework is used to generate all feasible assignment sets, which represents the different ways agents can play roles to achieve goals in the organization. Fourth, for each assignment set, a Markov chain is constructed, which captures the behavior of the system; finally, algorithm 
$${R}_{O}$$
 R O is executed on each Markov chain to compute their steady states (either success or failure) for further analysis. The proposed approach is validated through the simulation of two organization-based multiagent systems from the robotics domain.},

  abstract  = {How to explore useful features from images as prompts to guide the deep image restoration models is an effective way to solve image restoration. In contrast to mining spatial relations within images as prompt, which leads to characteristics of different frequencies being neglected and further remaining subtle or undetectable artifacts in the restored image, we develop a F requency Pro mpting image restoration method, dubbed FPro , which can effectively provide prompt components from a frequency perspective to guild the restoration model address these differences. Specifically, we first decompose input features into separate frequency parts via dynamically learned filters, where we introduce a gating mechanism for suppressing the less informative elements within the kernels. To propagate useful frequency information as prompt, we then propose a dual prompt block, consisting of a low-frequency prompt modulator (LPM) and a high-frequency prompt modulator (HPM), to handle signals from different bands respectively. Each modulator contains a generation process to incorporate prompting components into the extracted frequency maps, and a modulation part that modifies the prompt feature with the guidance of the decoder features.

  abstract  = {The initial orientation of resilience emanates from nature and the complex ecosystem in which it operates. The information systems (IS) discipline inherently concerns complex systems within socio-technical environments with symbiotic assimilation of social and technological elements. However, current views of IS resilience are underpinned through conceptual and theoretical lenses, which raises the question of the practical implementation of realising IS resilience. This research focuses on illuminating the operationalisation of IS resilience and determining good practices for realising IS resilience. The study adopted a multiple case study approach involving two financial service organisations. Interviews and document analysis were used to gather data regarding resilience approaches and practices. The data were aggregated, themed and compared to elucidate the IS approaches and practices. The findings show that the organisations use various methods to look at systems resilience, of which SRE, ITIL, agile, DevOps and elements of project management are foremost. Research shows that organisations need an overarching conceptual model for driving system resilience activities. Our findings show that no single conceptual model drives system resilience approaches across the South African financial services sector or even within a single organisation. Furthermore, the findings provide a practical view of the approaches and practices adopted to realise IS resilience within the financial services industry. Future research should examine how SRE, ITIL, Agile, DevOps and project management can be used together to discover the most beneficial resilience outcomes.},

To increase the resilience and self-healing capabilities, greater automation of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a key factor. It is a challenge to gather knowledge about faults, as these rarely occur compared to normal behavior. The flexibility in skill-based production systems makes this situation even more difficult. To overcome this challenge, data and knowledge about faults and their context from several Cyber-Physical Production Modules is used, which leads to federated knowledge databases. The knowledge databases are modeled in the Capability-Skill-Service-Fault-Symptom model (CSSFS model). To achieve the goal of high availability, resilience and autonomy of CPPS, automated decision-making for FDD using CSSFS applications is required. Therefore, automatic communication between FDD components is necessary. Therefore, focus of this paper is on the development of a communication scheme, which models participants using Asset Administration Shells and the I4.0 Language to model their interactions to enable automated communication and makes distributed knowledge accessible. To ensure decentralized control of these services, functionalities from several factory levels are encapsulated by Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) that follow a holonic structure.},

Current approaches for histological artifact restoration, based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and pixel-level Diffusion Models, suffer from performance limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, LatentArtiFusion, which leverages the latent diffusion model (LDM) to reconstruct histological artifacts with high performance and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional pixel-level diffusion frameworks, LatentArtiFusion executes the restoration process in a lower-dimensional latent space, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a novel regional artifact reconstruction algorithm in latent space to prevent mistransfer in non-artifact regions, distinguishing our approach from GAN-based methods. Through extensive experiments on real-world histology datasets, LatentArtiFusion demonstrates remarkable speed, outperforming state-of-the-art pixel-level diffusion frameworks by more than 
$$30{\times }$$

This study aims to address the pressing need for more efficient and environmentally friendly practices in the petrochemical industry, where the demand for greener solutions is increasing due to regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. The proposed framework provides a fully quantitative basis for decision-making, enabling petrochemical companies to make informed choices that prioritize meeting customer demands, reducing costs, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a model was developed to enhance the efficiency of the petroleum condensate supply chain through mathematical programming, enabling the formulation and implementation of strategic and tactical strategies. The aim is to minimize investment and operational expenses as well as greenhouse gas emissions associated with petroleum and gas pipelines, ensuring compliance with pressure and transmission network criteria. Moreover, efforts are made to reduce the environmental impact by minimizing pollutant emissions within the supply chain. By utilizing a practical case study, all potential decisions are thoroughly evaluated to address the environmental considerations of the supply chain. The proposed model demonstrates a high level of reliability and accuracy when compared to simulation modeling and the NSGA-II meta-heuristic algorithm, effectively estimating the desired objectives.},

  abstract  = {Wealth inequality is one of the most profound challenges confronting society today. However, an important issue in addressing inequality lies in formalizing the diversity of individual perspectives regarding what constitutes a fair distribution of resources. We tackle this topic by simulating wealth inequality through the allocation of bonus endowments in both Dictator Game (DG) and Ultimatum Game (UG) settings and capturing distributive decisions. By integrating a computational model, we quantify individual differences in the interplay between financial self-interest and competing pro-social motivations that emerge in the context of pre-existing wealth inequity. Our behavioral results show that, on average, pre-existing wealth influences distributive preferences across both allocations and proposals. Yet, inequality elicits non-uniform fairness concerns. Using a hierarchical clustering approach, we objectively categorise participants’ behavior elucidating four distinct decision strategies: ‘Pro-Self’, ‘Table Egalitarianism’, ‘Total Egalitarianism’, and ‘Moral Opportunism’. A balanced distribution of strategies is observed during allocations (DG), whereas Table Egalitarianism prevails in strategic proposals (UG), highlighting the influence of strategic considerations on decision strategy. Furthermore, we demonstrate an association between strategies across decision contexts. Our findings thus contribute a principled framework to formalize distributive preferences, revealing that, with respect to both altruistic allocations and strategic proposals, competing ideals of fairness underlie distributive preferences under wealth inequality.},

  abstract  = {Climate change and human activities are the primary drivers influencing changes in runoff dynamics. However, current understanding of future hydrological processes under scenarios of gradual climate change and escalating human activities remains uncertain, particularly in tropical regions affected by deforestation. Based on this, we employed the SWAT model coupled with the near future (2021–2040) and middle future (2041–2060) global climate models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1-2.6 (SSP1 + RCP2.6), SSP2-4.5 (SSP2 + RCP4.5), SSP3-7.0 (SSP3 + RCP7.0), and SSP5-8.5 (SSP5 + RCP8.5)) from the CMIP6 and the CA-Markov model to evaluate the runoff response to future environmental changes in the Dingan River Basin (DRB). The quantification of the impacts of climate change and land use change on future runoff changes was conducted. The results revealed a non-significant increasing trend in precipitation during the historical period (1999–2018). Furthermore, all three future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) exhibited an upward trend in precipitation from 2021 to 2060. Notably, the SSP5-8.5 scenario demonstrated a highly significant increase ( P  < 0.01), while the SSP2-4.5 scenario displayed a non-significant decreasing trend. The future precipitation pattern exhibits a decrease during spring and winter, while showing an increase in summer and autumn. The temperature exhibited a significant increase ( P  < 0.05) across the four future scenarios, with amplitudes of 0.24 °C/(10 years), 0.36 °C/(10 years), 0.36 °C/(10 years), and 0.50 °C/(10 years) for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 respectively. The future trend of land use change entails a continuous increase in cultivated land and a corresponding decrease in artificial forest land. By 2032, the area of cultivated land is projected to witness a growth of 4.10},

  abstract  = {Rural Revitalization (RR) is a key national strategy in China aimed at sustainable rural development and has gained significant attention. Given the unique characteristics of different villages, understanding differentiated paths to achieve RR is essential. This study introduces a new “5I Framework” (INDUS-INHAB-INDOC-INFRA-INCOM) to assess RR’s overall development status (ODS) and differentiated paths. Then, using western China as a case, this study employs entropy weight, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and hierarchical clustering to categorize differentiated RR paths into “4L Category” (Lots-Learning-Labor-Living). Context-specific recommendations are provided for each category. “5I” and “4L” are derived from their initial letters for easier recall and global dissemination. Our findings reveal ODS’s temporal fluctuations between Acceptable and Good Grades (0.3 and 0.6), with Chongqing’s villages showing a downward trend (from 0.439 to 0.407); the findings also reveal spatial differences in ODS, as northern villages generally score higher due to distinct characteristics. Seven differentiated paths to RR are identified, highlighting varying dimensions essential for RR success: INFRA is crucial across all high ODS paths, while INHAB and INDOC are not always central. Besides, these paths are grouped into four clusters via hierarchical clustering, indicating that RR can be achieved by integrating “lots” of aspects, enhancing “learning” and cultural status among residents, requiring villagers’ “labor” to support agriculture, or improving the “living” environment. The clustered categories enhance the applicability of our proposed countermeasures in similar contexts. The “5I Framework” facilitates theoretical understanding and evaluation of RR, while the “4L Category” underpinned by the “5I Framework” promotes effective implementation practices—both representing innovations of this study.},

However, the energy system is affected by many factors, which are complex and highly uncertain.

First, this paper deduces the time response function of the optimization model. The relevant parameters of the model can be found using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, the properties of the model are studied, and it is found that the optimized model have stronger universality and stability. Finally, the model is applied to predict and analyze the energy consumption of China. The prediction results indicate that China’s consumption of hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, and coal will be 12.693 exajoules, 5.550 exajoules, and 98.850 exajoules in 2026, respectively.

  abstract  = {Blasting excavation is widely used in mining, tunneling and construction industries, but it leads to produce ground vibration which can seriously damage the urban communities. The peak particle velocity (PPV) is one of main indicators for determining the extent of ground vibration. Owing to the complexity of blasting process, there is controversy over which parameters will be considered as the inputs for empirical equations and machine learning (ML) algorithms. According to current researches, the burden has controversial impact on the blast-induced ground vibration. To judge whether the burden affects blast-induced ground vibration, the data of ground vibration considering burden have been recorded at the Wujiata coal mine. Correlation coefficient is used to analyze the relationship between variables, the correlation between the distance from blasting center to monitored point ( R ) and peak particle velocity (PPV) is greatest and the value of correlation coefficient is − 0.67. This study firstly summarizes the most common empirical equations, and a new empirical equation is established by dimension analysis. The new equation shows better performance of predicting PPV than most other empirical equations by regression analysis. Secondly, the machine learning is confirmed the applicability of predicting PPV. Based on the performance assessments, regression error characteristic curve and Uncertainty analysis in the first round of predicting PPV, the random forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) show better performance than other four machine learning algorithms. Then, in the second round, based on the artithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), the optimized random forest (AOA-RF) model as the most accurate model compared with the optimized K-Nearest Neighbors (AOA-KNN) presented in the literature. Finally, the points of predicted PPV which have been informed of danger are marked based on Chinese safety regulations for blasting.},

  abstract  = {Medical image segmentation is extensively applied in clinical diagnosis, providing physicians with accurate, rapid, and visual analysis tools. With the vigorous development of deep learning, the emergence of U-shaped networks has achieved outstanding performance in medical image segmentation. However, they cannot extract sufficient boundary features due to the continuous downsampling and focus primarily on local features without taking full advantage of global context information. In this paper, we present a G lobal C ontext-Enhanced M ulti-Scale R esidual Network (GCMR-Net) to tackle these problems. Specifically, the first component of GCMR-Net is a Multi-scale residual pooling (MSRP) module, which seamlessly integrates depth-wise separable convolution and atrous convolution to achieve more efficient feature extraction and information transmission. Second, based on the MSRP module, we propose a convolution encoder named MSRPE that progressively extracts abstract and higher-level features through cascaded convolutional layers. The features generated by MSRPE are efficiently reused in the corresponding decoder layers to facilitate the restoration of intricate image details. The third essential component is the global channel–spatial dual attention (GCSDA) mechanism, which enhances the global perception of the model and captures the contextual information to locate targets precisely. Furthermore, we design a feature pyramid compensation and refinement (FPCR) module, which mitigates feature loss in the decoder through various scales of convolution and upsampling operation, generating feature maps ranging from coarse to fine. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on three biomedical image datasets and the results demonstrate that GCMR-Net exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

This study examines the historical short-term effects of heat on mortality in Alentejo, Portugal’s warmest region, and projects it up to the end of the century. Methods Using data from 1980 to 2015 during warm seasons (May-September), the association between daily mortality by all-causes and mean temperature was examined following a case time series design, applied at both regional and subregional scales. Projections for daily temperatures were obtained from regional climate models and greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5). We also examined temporal shifts in mortality considering potential long-term and seasonal adaptative responses to heat. We then quantified the yearly effects of heat by calculating absolute and relative excess mortality from 1980 to 2015, specifically during the heatwave of 2003 (July 27 to August 15), and in future projections at 20-year intervals through 2100. Results The analysis revealed a significant rise in mortality risk at temperatures exceeding a minimum mortality temperature (MMT) of 19.0 °C, with an exponential trend and delayed effects lasting up to 5 days. The risk increased by 413},

  abstract  = {Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the development of computational models for any complex system, as it allows for comparison of the relative influence of model parameters on the simulation results. Its role is even more critical in the context of numerical safety assessment for future geological repositories of radioactive waste since it provides insights into understanding relevant to safety processes, establishes grounds for prioritizing additional research, enhances confidence in the safety assessment results. Unfortunately, groundwater flow and radionuclide transport models for radioactive waste repositories often become quite detailed and computationally expensive during the iterative process of the safety assessment. Moreover, any meaningful statistical analysis of the simulation results requires hundreds, if not thousands, of model realizations at different parameter combinations. This necessity has led to the increasing popularity of sensitivity analysis methods coupled with metamodeling approaches where a portion of the points in the parametric space (model realizations) is obtained through numerical simulation of processes, and another portion is approximated from available realizations using less computationally demanding data-driven algorithms. Modern machine learning methods also frequently address the problem of predicting a response function at new points using data from known points. Feature importance measures for machine learning models serve a role akin to sensitivity analysis: they assist in quantifying the effect of model inputs (features) on outputs (predictions). In this paper, we compare the modern first-choice variant of sensitivity analysis, variance-based Sobol’ indices, obtained using polynomial chaos expansion metamodel, with well-known importance measures from the machine learning world.},

  abstract  = {The multi-fidelity Kriging model is a promising technique in surrogate-based design, balancing model accuracy and the cost of sample generation by combining low- and high-fidelity data. However, the cost of building a multi-fidelity Kriging model increases significantly as problem complexity grows. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Hierarchical Kriging modeling method. In building the low-fidelity model, distance correlation is used to determine the relative value of the hyperparameter. This transforms the maximum likelihood estimation problem into a one-dimensional optimization task, which can be solved efficiently, significantly improving modeling efficiency. The high-fidelity model is built similarly, with the low-fidelity model's hyperparameter used as the relative value for the high-fidelity model's hyperparameter. The proposed method's effectiveness is evaluated through analytical problems and a real-world engineering problem involving modeling the isentropic efficiency of a compressor rotor. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces modeling time significantly without compromising accuracy. For the compressor rotor isentropic efficiency model, the proposed method yields over 99},

  abstract  = {Since the scattering of suspension particles and the absorption of light by the water, single underwater image often suffers from some serious color cast and hazing problems, which hinder the application of advance vision technology in the underwater. To address these degradation problems, we propose a fast fusion-based method for underwater image enhancement. First, an adaptive color correction module with color cast judgment is designed to adjust the color cast of different scenes. Then, we design the dehazed and detail enhancement module to adjust the luminance channel of the image. Finally, a Laplace decomposition and multi-scale fusion strategy based on luminance channel is proposed to enhance the comprehensive contrast of the image. Our method is not dependent on complex physical imaging models while processing only at the channel level, which reduces the running time of the algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms of the same field. Besides, our method is equally applicable to the images of foggy and sandstorm.},

  abstract  = {Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) has been reported in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here the authors show that epithelial MAPK activity promotes myofibroblastic differentiation of CAFs. Furthermore, the epithelial basal-like subtype is associated with a CAF phenotype characterized by elevated MAPK activity and TGF-β signalling, associated with T cell exclusion in PDAC. Fibroblast heterogeneity is increasingly recognised across cancer conditions. Given their important contribution to disease progression, mapping fibroblasts’ heterogeneity is critical to devise effective anti-cancer therapies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the most abundant cell population in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Whether CAF phenotypes are differently specified by PDAC cell lineages remains to be elucidated. Here, we reveal an important role for the MAPK signalling pathway in defining PDAC CAF phenotypes. We show that epithelial MAPK activity promotes the myofibroblastic differentiation of CAFs by sustaining the expression and secretion of TGF-β1. We integrate single-cell profiling of post-perturbation transcriptional responses from mouse models with cellular and spatial profiles of human tissues to define a MAPK^high CAF (mapCAF) phenotype. We show that this phenotype associates with basal-like tumour cells and reduced frequency of CD8^+ T cells. In addition to elevated MAPK activity, this mapCAF phenotype is characterized by TGF-β signalling, hypoxia responsive signatures, and immunoregulatory gene programs. Furthermore, the mapCAF signature is enriched in myofibroblastic CAFs from various cancer conditions and correlates with reduced response to immune checkpoint inhibition in melanoma. Altogether, our data expand our knowledge on CAF phenotype heterogeneity and reveal a potential strategy for targeting myofibroblastic CAFs in vivo.},

  abstract  = {The stress–strain relationship equation (physical model) is vital for computer simulations in high-temperature metals, exemplified by the Johnson–Cook (JC) model. This equation is crucial for predicting the strength of high-temperature materials, particularly high-tensile steel parts. The JC model comprises various constitutive equations or combinations of factors that elucidate the intricate connection between material strength and temperature. However, these constitutive equations require more resources as they become more complex, which is true even when employing finite element model updating (FEMU) based on the finite element (FE) method. This study introduces a novel approach to address this resource issue: applying build-up factors to constitutive equations. The proposed method efficiently approximated the JC model factors and mitigated the resource-intensive nature of complex constitutive equations. Our approach commenced with initializing JC model factors through numerical analysis in the preprocessing stage. Subsequently, the initialized JC model was employed in the FE simulations. The simulation results were assessed using the root mean square error (RMSE) and compared with experimental results. The impact of build-up factors and temperature coefficients on FEMU was studied to reduce RMSE. We implemented metamodel-based optimization for FEMU, including the design of experiments, response surface creation, and response surface analysis. The proposed method yielded RMSE values similar to conventional methods while significantly economizing on resources. Both the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis can be substantially enhanced with precise FEMU factor configuration and applying our method to extensive analyses in high-temperature conditions.},

To facilitate the implementation and operation of GBAS Approach Service Type (GAST)-D at Hong Kong International Airport, the impact of EPB induced spatial gradients needs to be analyzed. Previous simulations using a two-dimensional trapezoid model neglected the three-dimensional structure of the EPB, assuming ionospheric delay on a thin shell at a specific altitude. To address this limitation, this paper adopts a cube above the magnetic equator to characterize the EPB threat model. The ionospheric delay difference between satellite signals passing through the EPB model is limited by the upper bound spatial gradient derived with the data collected from Hong Kong Satellite Positioning Reference Station Network. The simulation results reveal that ionospheric monitors in GAST D can satisfy the Category II/III approach requirement, i.e., the probability of missed detection

Making changes in the software by insertion, deletion or modification of new code may lead to malfunctioning of the old code. Hence, there is a need for a priori analysis to ensure and capture these types of changes to run the software smoothly. Making changes in the software while it is in use is called dynamic evolution. Due to the lack of formal modeling and verification, this dynamic evolution process of software systems has not become prominent. Hence, we used the bigraphical reactive system (BRS) technique to ensure that changes do not break the software functionality (adversely affect the system). BRS provides a powerful framework for modeling, analyzing, and verifying the dynamic evolution of software systems, resulting in ensuring the reliability and correctness of evolving software system. In this paper, we proposed a formal method technique for modeling and verifying the dynamic evolution process (changing user requirements at run time) using the BRS. We used a bigraph to model software architectures and described the evolution rules for supporting the dynamic changes of the software system. Finally, we have used the BigMC model checker tool to validate this model with its properties and provide associated verification procedures.},

We delve into the advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots like ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Gemini, and Bing to assist with OOP learning. While these tools offer benefits like providing code examples and explanations, limitations exist in accurate problem interpretation and adherence to best practices. Building upon the previous student-focused analysis, we present the results of a new survey targeting software engineering teachers: ‘Survey on the Use of AI Chatbots in Teaching Software Engineering’. This survey sheds light on how educators integrate chatbots into their curriculum and their perspectives on their effectiveness. The original student survey revealed positive impressions of chatbots as study aids, with a high percentage utilizing and finding them valuable. The teacher survey will provide further insights into their role in the teaching and learning process, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient software engineers. Recognizing and addressing the limitations of chatbots remains crucial to maximizing their potential in OOP education. This paper is an extension of work originally presented in Conisoft 2023 [1].},

  abstract  = {The development of artificial intelligence models for data driven decision making has a lot of potential for the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, applications in industry are currently limited to the actionable insights one can discover from the available data and knowledge of a manufacturing system. We call the process to obtain such insights “ad hoc analysis”. Ad hoc analysis at system level is very complex in an industrial setting due to the inherent heterogeneity of data and existence of data silos, the lack of information and knowledge formalization, and the inability to meaningfully and efficiently reason about the data, information and knowledge. In this paper, we provide and outline a framework for ad hoc analysis in manufacturing based on knowledge graphs and influenced by the metamodelling paradigm. We derive its requirements and key elements from an analysis of several industry application cases. We show how manufacturing data, information and knowledge can be combined and made actionable using this framework. The framework supports workflows and tools for the data consumer (i.e., data scientist), and for the knowledge engineer. Furthermore, we show how the framework is integrated with existing data sources. Then, we discuss how we applied the framework to several application cases. We discuss how the framework contributes when applied, and what challenges still remain.},

  abstract  = {To correctly formalise requirements expressed in natural language, ambiguities must first be identified and then fixed. This paper focuses on behavioural requirements (i.e. requirements related to dynamic aspects and phenomena). Its first objective is to show, based on a practical, public case study, that the disambiguation process cannot be fully automated : even though natural language processing (NLP) tools and machine learning might help in the identification of ambiguities, fixing them often requires a deep, application-specific understanding of the reasons of being of the system of interest, of the characteristics of its environment, of which trade-offs between conflicting objectives are acceptable, and of what is achievable and what is not; it may also require arduous negotiations between stakeholders. Such an understanding and consensus-making ability is not in the reach of current tools and technologies, and will likely remain so for a long while. Beyond ambiguity, requirements are often marred by various other types of defects that could lead to wholly unacceptable consequences. In particular, operational experience shows that requirements inadequacy (whereby, in some of the situations the system could face, what is required is woefully inappropriate or what is necessary is left unspecified) is a significant cause for systems failing to meet expectations. The second objective of this paper is to propose a semantically accurate behavioural requirements formalisation format enabling tool-supported requirements verification , notably with simulation . Such support is necessary for the engineering of large and complex cyber-physical and socio-technical systems to ensure, first, that the specified requirements indeed reflect the true intentions of their authors and second, that they are adequate for all the situations the system could face. To that end, the paper presents an overview of the BASAALT ( Behaviour Analysis and Simulation All Along systems Life Time ) systems engineering method, and of FORM-L ( FOrmal Requirements Modelling Language ), its supporting language, which aims at representing as accurately and completely as possible the semantics expressed in the original, natural language behavioural requirements, and is markedly different from languages intended for software code generation. The paper shows that generally, semantically accurate formalisation is not a simple paraphrasing of the original natural language requirements: additional elements are often needed to fully and explicitly reflect all that is implied in natural language. To provide such complements for the case study presented in the paper, we had to follow different formalisation patterns , i.e. sequences of formalisation steps. For this paper, to avoid being skewed by what a particular automatic tool can and cannot do, BASAALT and FORM-L were applied manually. Still, the lessons learned could be used to specify and develop NLP tools that could assist the disambiguation and formalisation processes. However, more studies are needed to determine whether an exhaustive set of formalisation patterns can be identified to fully automate the formalisation process.},

This paper proposes the construction of a machining error propagation event-knowledge graph (MEPEKG) for quality control in MMPs, inspired by the application of knowledge graphs to data, information, and knowledge organization and utilization. Initially, a cyber-physical system (CPS)-based production process data acquisition sensor network is constructed, and process flow-oriented process monitoring is achieved through the radio frequency identification (RFID) production event model. Secondly, the process-related quality feature and working condition data are preprocessed; features are extracted from the distributed CPS nodes; and the production event model is used to achieve the dynamic mapping and updating of feature data under the guidance of the MEPEKG schema layer. Moreover, the mathematical model of machining error propagation based on the second-order Taylor expansion is used to quantitatively analyze the quality control in MMPs based on the support of MEPEKG data. Finally, the efficacy and reliability of the MEPEKG for error propagation analysis and quality control of MMPs were verified using a case study of a specially shaped rotary component.},

In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Deformable U-Net with Cos-spatial and Channel Hybrid Transformer (MDHT-Net) for pancreas segmentation. To mitigate the ambiguity between the codec stages, the Cos-spatial and Channel Hybrid Transformer (CCHT) module is designed as a novel skip connection, enhancing the network’s ability to perceive spatial information and reveal the inter-channel relationships within different layers’ features. Furthermore, the CCHT efficiently aggregates multi-stage contextual information by improving the self-attention mechanism in two different manners, overcoming the limitation of computational complexity. In addition, to comprehensively understand deep semantic information, the Multi-scale Feature Adaptive-extraction (MFA) module is proposed to dynamically enhance the network’s receptive field by integrating the pancreas characteristics of scale variations. The experimental results present that our proposed MDHT-Net achieves superior performance compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods on two public pancreas datasets, with the mean Dice coefficient of

Drawing on the organizational climate literature, while integrating signaling theory and attribution theory, we hypothesize that the impact of CSR climate on team performance through team empowerment hinges on two key factors. First, teams must perceive the presence of CSR initiatives, denoting CSR climate quality. Secondly, there must be a consensus regarding the authenticity of these initiatives, signifying CSR climate strength. Results from a partial least squares—structural equation modeling analysis of multi-informant data obtained from 537 team members within 73 teams of 35 retail organizations in Belgium support most of our hypotheses. The results reveal that both CSR climate quality and strength are important drivers of team empowerment in support of team performance.},

  abstract  = {Rheumatology faces a critical shortage of health-care professionals, exacerbated by an ageing patient population and escalating costs, resulting in widening gaps in care. Exponential advances in digital health technologies (DHTs) in the past 5 years offer new opportunities to address these challenges and could contribute to overall improved health care. However, keeping pace with innovations and integrating them into clinical practice can be challenging. This Review explores the transformative potential of DHTs for rheumatology in reshaping the entire patient pathway and redefining the roles of patients and providers, and discusses the potential barriers to DHT integration. Key technologies, such as large language models, clinical decision-support systems, digital therapeutics, electronic patient-reported outcomes, digital biomarkers, robots, self-sampling devices and artificial intelligence-based scribes, can be implemented along the patient pathway. A digital-first hybrid stepped-care patient pathway could combine in-person and remote care, enabling personalized and continuous monitoring through a digital safety net. The potential benefits and risks of transforming the traditional patient–provider relationship into a digital health triad with technology are discussed. Collaborative efforts are needed to navigate the evolving digital health landscape and harness the potential of DHTs to improve rheumatology care. Digital health has the potential to improve patient care in rheumatology and alleviate strain on the health-care system. This Review explores the current status of the transition from traditional health care to a model that harnesses the potential of digital health technologies, including discussion of the main benefits and barriers. Digital health improves access to care by offering decentralized and continuous services along the entire patient pathway that effectively bridge current care gaps. Digital-first hybrid care models and integrating remote and in-person care enable more flexible and need-adapted patient monitoring, reducing unnecessary visits and improving resource allocation in rheumatology. Digital health technologies empower patients to take a more active role in self-managing their conditions. Implementation of artificial intelligence reduces the burden of care for patients and health-care professionals and fosters data-driven medical decisions. Regulatory hurdles, reimbursement and scarcity of evidence represent major barriers preventing digital health technology implementation. By sharing lessons learned and fostering collaboration, rheumatologists can accelerate the digital health transition and fully harness its potential.},

The technique discovers each participant’s process through already available algorithms introduced by the process mining community. Then, it analyzes the logs to extract information on the exchange of messages to automatically combine the discovered processes into a collaboration model representing the distributed system’s behavior and providing analytics on the interactions.

Other than learning self-protection, people need to have a specialized gadget that allows them to find support the soonest while they are in a difficult situation. However, admittance to a particular gadget or application may not be feasible for them immediately after the assault. As a proposed arrangement, we have built up a framework in the form of a band, including an electromyography sensor (EMG) sensor and a heartbeat sensor named FemmeBand. This group of devices is connected using wireless body area network (WBAN)’s on-body communication. The conjugation of the sensor nodes will convey SOS messages in the wake of deciphering a signal pattern from the EMG sensor brought about by gestures of hand along with the combination of a pulse rate from the subject. FemmeBand deals with Arduino Uno, ESP8266 WiFi module, EMG muscle sensor, and heartbeat sensor, all of which are powered by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery. In a time of danger, FemmeBand can send signals to the cell phone, sending the person’s coordinates to contacts pre-saved in safelists.},

The second antenna with ‘L’-shaped slot produces a gain of 2.2 dBi, while the third antenna with ‘A’-shaped slot produces a gain of 1.9 dBi. Parametric studies are carried out to achieve best antenna performance in terms of both return loss and gain. Detail performance analysis is performed for different shapes of antenna slots, and a comparative study of the proposed antenna is conducted with the existing reported ones. Simulations are done using ANSYS make HFSS v15.0. The antennas are fabricated using FR4 epoxy material, and the parameters are experimentally measured.

  abstract  = {Mangroves can increase their elevation relative to tidal flooding through biogeomorphic feedbacks but can submerge if rates of sea-level rise are too great. There is an urgent need to understand the vulnerability of mangroves to sea-level rise so local communities and resource managers can implement and prioritize actions. The need is especially pressing for small islands, which have been identified as an area of concern by the IPCC. We developed a generalizable modeling framework for tidal wetlands (WARMER-3) that accounts for species interactions and the belowground processes that dictate soil elevation building relative to sea levels. The model was calibrated with extensive field datasets, including accretion rates derived from 29 soil cores, over 300 forest inventory plots, water level, and elevation. The model included five mangrove tree species and was applied across seven regions around the Pacific Island of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, where mangrove forest is a critical ecosystem that supports subsistence living for local communities. We explored mangrove resilience and carbon accumulation under six sea-level rise scenarios. We also conducted an analysis to determine the sea-level rise rate threshold above which mangroves would be lost. The results suggest that Pohnpei mangroves can build their elevations relative to low and moderate rates of sea-level rise to prevent submergence, with limited loss of mangrove area through 2150. Under higher sea-level rise rates, however, forest elevation decreased substantially relative to mean sea level and there was extensive loss of mangrove area by that year. Regarding mangrove community composition, for all sea-level rise scenarios, the model predicted a change to increasing relative abundance of flood tolerant species and decreasing relative abundance of high-elevation species, which started to being realized by 2100. Variation in sediment supply, water levels, and elevation capital led to differential vulnerability around the island. We identified a threshold for Pohnpei mangroves where if local sea-level rise rates exceed 7.8 ± 2.2 mm/year they are projected to eventually submerge and be lost. Our modeling framework is novel by addressing both species interactions and critical belowground processes to better understand potential tidal ecosystem responses to sea-level rise.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing companies struggle with overwhelming expectations, disruptions and trends sweeping over their business environment. The evident climate change, together with rising sustainable development goals, is forcing companies to discover their environmental impact, in addition to the more familiar economic one. The transformation from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE) reduces waste and improves resource efficiency through the deployed R-cycles, such as recycle, reuse and repair. This transformation is feasible for multinational enterprises because they can allocate sufficient resources for their strategic development goals. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), any additional investment must be carefully assessed and planned. Thus, SMEs need support and tools to select their next development investments. Generally, maturity models help companies find their status (compared to others) and identify the most important development areas and actions. This paper presents the CE maturity matrix, which comprises five maturity levels mapped with seven linear manufacturing value chain phases. The matrix was piloted with nine manufacturing industry companies, four of which were from Finland, one from Italy, one from Germany and three from Ireland. The CE matrix interview results showed that none of the interviewed manufacturing industry companies remained at the linearity level. The most common levels varied between systemic material management and CE thinking. In the interviews, over 40 CE actions were identified as the argument for a company reaching a CE maturity level. The transition towards sustainable manufacturing has already started but will require efforts to accelerate and to engage companies to proceed.},

  abstract  = {Models and modelling play a critical role in science education to engage students more fully in science practices. Few studies have investigated the nature of models and modelling in integrated STEM teacher education. This study examines pre-service science teachers’ (PSTs) understanding of the nature of models and modelling in a STEM methods course. Model and modelling for authentic STEM are used as a theoretical lens for conceptualising PSTs’ understanding of the nature of models and modelling. Interpretive research was used to analyse how this course contributed to PSTs’ understanding of the nature of models and modelling based on four dimensions: meanings, purposes, processes and the complexity of models and modelling. Data were collected through questionnaires. Inductive content analysis was used to reveal distinct patterns of PSTs’ understandings. The findings indicated that at the beginning of the course, PSTs understood that models were a replication of phenomena or a prototype. By the end of the course, they understood modelling as a practice to explain and predict phenomena in science to solve problems and improve the quality of life through engineering. By the end of the course, PSTs viewed modelling as a bridge between science and engineering within the context of an integrated STEM education. The PSTs showed marked shifts by the end of the course by demonstrating a deeper understanding of modelling as a dynamic process. PSTs saw the integration of science and engineering in STEM as a route for epistemic agency on behalf of their students and a greater appreciation of model complexity. This study suggests that introducing the nature of modelling in science and engineering assists the teaching of STEM. The model and modelling implications for STEM teacher education are discussed.},

  abstract  = {In 2008, approximately one third of Beijing’s severe smog pollution stemmed from its traffic sector. The local government addressed this problem by adopting a city-wide driving restriction policy. Starting from 2010, a congestion charge policy has been under discussion. While Beijing’s municipality has tried to bring traffic-related smog under control with these regulatory and market-based policies, there has been significant public opposition to both policies. Public acceptance is critical to successful policy making and implementation; however, the literature offers little insight into the key elements influencing public acceptance in the context of multiple policy choices. Based on a questionnaire survey of 285 respondents in Beijing, this paper adopts ordered logistic regression to explore the key factors influencing public acceptance of driving restriction and congestion charge policies. The results show that the public in Beijing prefers the driving restriction policy to the congestion charge policy. Political concerns, such as concerns relating to policy making transparency and perceived fairness, as well as economic concerns, such as concerns relating to car ownership and extra traffic cost, are essential determinants of public acceptance of such policies. Specifically, citizens who are more concerned about equity hold stronger negative opinions on the congestion charge policy.},

  abstract  = {The work in this paper aims to study the off-design performance of in-plane functionally graded (FG) nanocomposite panels subjected to supersonic flow and thermal in-plane loading. The off-design conditions are represented by elastic edge supports (each elastic edge is supported by sets of out-of-plane and in-plane springs) and yawed supersonic flow. The study presents a novel parametric analysis to analyze the effects of the elastic edges’ flexibility levels and their direction relative to the flow angle on the instability thresholds with the existence of thermal loading. It also presents a new study on the effects of different elastic boundary conditions on the nonlinear limit cycle oscillation amplitude which have not been addressed before. It also proposes a novel uncertainty analysis scheme using the peridynamic operator as a metamodel for highly nonlinear discontinuous functions to study the effects of the uncertain elastic edge supports on the uncertainty of the limit cycle oscillation amplitude. The Kirchhoff–Love plate theory with the nonlinear von Kármán strains is used for the structural modeling, and the first-order piston theory is used for the aerodynamic modeling. The finite element method is used for numerical analysis. Comparisons between the performance of the homogenous panels and the performance of the in-plane functionally graded panels due to these off-design conditions are also presented to assess the effects of the in-plane material inhomogeneity. The results show slight variations in the behavior of the FG panels and the homogenous panels. The flow yaw angle can have a significant effect on the flutter speed and the LCO amplitude depending on the panel’s aspect ratio and the degree of the edge’s flexibility. The trailing elastic edges have the dominant effect on the aeroelastic behavior compared to the leading edges. The in-plane edges flexibility has less effect on the nature of the post-flutter response compared to the out-of-plane edges flexibility. The proposed peridynamic operator scheme seems to be an efficient tool for the uncertainty analysis of nonlinear discontinuous aeroelastic systems.},

However, producing chemicals from toxic, highly concentrated, or cell-impermeable substrates, or chemicals dependent on enzymatic reactions incompatible with the yeast’s intracellular environment, remains challenging. One such chemical is 2- O -(α-D-glucopyranosyl)- sn -glycerol (glucosyl glycerol, αGG), a natural osmolyte used in the cosmetics and healthcare industries. This compound can be synthesised in a one-enzyme reaction from sucrose and glycerol by Leuconostoc mesenteroides sucrose phosphorylase (SucP), an enzyme which, in a low-water, glycerol-rich, phosphate-free environment, transfers the glucosyl moiety from sucrose to glycerol. Results In this study, we engineered a yeast microbial cell factory for αGG production. For this purpose, we first focused on the abundant yeast GPI-anchored cell wall protein Ccw12 and used our insights to develop a miniature Ccw12-tag, which adds only 1.1 kDa to the enzyme of interest while enabling its covalent attachment to the cell wall. Next, we Ccw12-tagged SucP and expressed it in an invertase-negative strain of yeast S. cerevisiae from the PHO5 promoter, i.e., promoter strongly induced under phosphate-free conditions. Such SucP isoform, covalently C-terminally anchored to the outer cell surface, produced extracellularly 37.3 g l^− 1 (146 mM) of αGG in five days, while the underlying chassis metabolised reaction by-products, thereby simplifying downstream processing. Conclusions The here-described S. cerevisiae strain, displaying C-terminally anchored sucrose phosphorylase on its cell surface, is the first eukaryotic microbial cell factory capable of a one-step αGG production from the readily available substrates sucrose and glycerol.},

  abstract  = {Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, particularly prevalent in Asia, especially in China, where both its incidence and mortality rates are significantly high. Meanwhile, nanotechnology has demonstrated great potential in the treatment of GC. In particular, nanodrug delivery systems have improved therapeutic efficacy and targeting through various functional modifications, such as targeting peptides, tumor microenvironment responsiveness, and instrument-based methods. For instance, silica (SiO_2) has excellent biocompatibility and can be used as a drug carrier, with its porous structure enhancing drug loading capacity. Polymer nanoparticles regulate drug release rates and mechanisms by altering material composition and preparation methods. Lipid nanoparticles efficiently encapsulate hydrophilic drugs and promote cellular uptake, while carbon-based nanoparticles can be used in biosensors and drug delivery. Targets such as integrins, HER2 receptors, and the tumor microenvironment have been used to improve drug efficacy in GC treatment. Nanodrug delivery techniques not only enhance drug efficacy and delivery capabilities but also selectively target tumor cells. Currently, there is a lack of systematic summarization and synthesis regarding the relationship between nanodrug delivery systems and GC treatment, which to some extent hinders researchers and clinicians from efficiently searching for and referencing related studies, thereby reducing work efficiency. This study aims to systematically summarize the existing research on the relationship between nanodrug delivery systems and GC treatment, making it easier for professionals to search and reference, and thereby promoting further research on the role of nanodrug delivery systems and their clinical applications in GC. This review discusses the applications of functionalized nanocarriers in the treatment of GC in recent years, including surface modifications with targeted markers, the combination of phototherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, along with their advantages and challenges. It also examines the future prospects of targeted nanomaterials in GC treatment. The review particularly focuses on the combined application of nanocarriers in multiple treatment modalities, such as phototherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, demonstrating their potential in multimodal treatments. Furthermore, it thoroughly explores the specific challenges that nanocarriers face in GC treatment, such as biocompatibility, drug release control, and clinical translation issues, while providing a systematic outlook on future developments. Additionally, this study emphasizes the potential value and feasibility of nanocarriers in clinical applications, contrasting with most reviews that focus on basic research. Through these innovations, we offer new perspectives and directions for the development of nanotechnology in the treatment of GC.},

  abstract  = {Purpose Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has an extremely poor prognosis. Despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy and modest survival improvements with the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), almost all patients experience relapse and fatal outcomes. Recent genomic insights uncovered extensive molecular heterogeneity in addition to the almost uniform loss of RB1 and TRP53 . Additionally, defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has recently been described in some SCLC cases. Here, we generated a novel SCLC mouse model capturing MMR deficiency and assessed immunotherapy responses. Methods We developed an MMR-deficient genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC by introducing a conditional Msh2 gene, crucial for maintaining MMR integrity, into the standard Rb1 ^ fl/fl ; Trp53 ^ fl/fl (RP) model. Genomic characteristics and preclinical therapy responses were evaluated by focusing on overall survival and whole exome sequencing (WES) analyses. Results MMR-defective SCLC tumors ( Rb1 ^ fl/fl ; Trp53 ^ fl/fl ; Msh2 ^ fl/fl (RPM)) developed later than tumors in MMR-proficient mice. However, the time from tumor manifestation to death of the affected animals was substantially shortened (median survival 55 days in RP vs. 46.5 days in RPM), indicating increased aggressiveness of MMR-defective tumors. RPM tumors exhibited MMR deficiency, high tumor mutational burden (TMB), and an elevated load of candidate neoantigens, compared to RP lesions ( p  = 0.0106), suggesting increased immunogenicity. Importantly, the overall survival of RPM animals was significantly improved when exposed to ICI. Conclusion We propose a novel RPM mouse model as a suitable system to mimic MMR-defective SCLC and tumors with high TMB. We provide in vivo evidence that Msh2 deficiency enhances ICI sensitivity. These findings could contribute to stratifying SCLC patients to immunotherapy, thereby improving treatment outcomes.},

  abstract  = {Optimizing the performance of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) (Sahin et al. in Proc IEEE Int Congr Big Data BigData Congr 410–417, 2016) is crucial for achieving efficient execution of Java applications. Feature selection plays a pivotal role in identifying the most relevant parameters for fine-tuning JVMs, thereby enhancing their overall efficiency. This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates both subject matter expertise and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) (Yin et al. in J Big Data 10(1):15, 2023) model to refine feature selection for JVM fine-tuning using machine learning techniques. Traditional feature selection methods often lack the ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, resulting in suboptimal selections (Khaire and Dhanalakshmi in J King Saud Univ Comput Inf Sci 34(4):1060–1073, 2022). In contrast, the hybrid approach leverages the expertise of JVM administrators or developers to guide the feature selection process. By integrating domain knowledge into the feature selection pipeline, ensure the inclusion of crucial JVM parameters that may not be captured by automated techniques alone. Furthermore, employed the RFE model, a powerful recursive feature elimination algorithm, to iteratively identify and eliminate irrelevant features from the initial feature set. This iterative process enhances the efficiency of feature selection by systematically pruning less influential parameters, thereby improving the overall performance of the JVM. To validate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach, conducted experiments using real-world JVM datasets and compare the performance of the method against existing feature selection techniques. The results demonstrate that the approach not only achieves superior performance in terms of JVM fine-tuning but also provides insights into the significance of domain expertise in optimizing JVM performance (Menéndez and Bartlett in http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16510 , 2023). It contributes to the field of JVM optimization by proposing a novel hybrid approach that combines subject matter expertise with machine learning-based feature selection techniques. By leveraging both domain knowledge and automated algorithms, the approach offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing feature selection in JVM fine-tuning, ultimately leading to improved performance and efficiency in Java application execution.},

In these designs, elliptical and circular sub-structures are used together in different ways to generate novel structures. The crashworthiness performances of the inspired structures are carried out with finite element analyses verified by physical experiments in the literature. The ideal structure is determined with the complex proportion assessment (COPRAS) method among 17 designs obtained from the Chladni patterns by using peak crushing force (PCF), total energy absorption (EA), specific energy absorption (SEA) and crash force efficiency (CFE) crashworthiness indicators. An optimization model with four design variables implemented with gray wolf optimization (GWO) is established to obtain the optimum cross section of the ideal structure. The constraint and objective functions of the optimization model are obtained with the radial basis function (RBF) method. The experimental set required for the RBF model is created using the Latin hypercube (LHC) method.},

As a paradigmatic example, we consider a strongly interacting driven-dissipative two-component Fermi gas where the non-equilibrium steady state is tuned by adjusting the chemical potential difference between two reservoirs that are coupled with the system. As a powerful theoretical tool to deal with this system, we employ the Schwinger-Keldysh Green’s function technique. We systematically evaluate the superfluid transition, as well as the single-particle properties, in the non-equilibrium BCS-BEC crossover region, by adjusting the chemical potential difference between the reservoirs and the strength of an s -wave pairing interaction associated with a Feshbach resonance. In the weak-coupling BCS side, the chemical potential difference is shown to imprint a two-step structure on the particle momentum distribution, leading to an anomalous enhancement of pseudogap, as well as the emergence of exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type superfluid instability. Since various non-equilibrium situations have recently been realized in ultracold Fermi gases, the theoretical understanding of non-equilibrium BCS-BEC crossover physics would become increasingly important in this research field.},

  abstract  = {Multibody dynamics simulation plays an important role in various fields, including mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics. Setting up computational models however becomes increasingly challenging as systems grow in size and complexity. Especially the consistent combination of models across different physical domains still requires significant effort. This motivates the study of formal languages that enable a compositional approach to modeling multiphysical systems with basic guarantees. The paper shows how multibody systems, or more precisely assemblies of rigid bodies connected by lower kinematic pairs, can be described as Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS). The EPHS modeling language features a straightforward graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of hierarchically nested subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates clearer communication among experts, nonexperts, and computational tools. Hierarchical nesting of systems enables abstraction of lower-level details and promotes the reuse of models at different levels of complexity. At the lowest level, there are three basic kinds of systems, representing energy storage and reversible/irreversible energy exchange. The structured approach guarantees fundamental properties of macroscopic systems, such as conservation of energy and nonnegative entropy production. In combination with the compositional syntax, this makes building and modifying models simpler and less error-prone.},

The design flexibility afforded by advanced nucleic acid sequence design tools vastly expands the repertoire of regulatory elements for circuit design. In principle, the design space of synthetic regulators should allow for the construction of regulatory circuits of arbitrary complexity; still, the orthogonality and robustness of such components have not been fully elucidated, thereby limiting the depth and width of synthetic circuits. Results In this work, we systematically explored the design strategy of synthetic transcriptional regulators, termed switchable transcription terminators. Specifically, by redesigning key sequence domains, we created a high-performance switchable transcription terminator with a maximum fold change of 283.11 upon activation by its cognate input RNA. Further, an automated design algorithm was developed for these elements to improve orthogonality for a complex multi-layered circuit construction. The resulting orthogonal switchable transcription terminators could be used to construct a three-layer cascade circuit and a two-input three-layer OR gate. Conclusions We demonstrated a practical strategy for designing standardized regulatory elements and assembling modular gene circuits, ultimately laying the foundation for the streamlined construction of complex synthetic gene circuits.},

  abstract  = {This study provides a reliability improvement control method for robotic arms with clearance joints. Firstly, the dynamical model of a six-DOF robotic arm with joint clearance is established, and the Archard model is utilized to describe joint wear, considering its effect on clearance evolution. The kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the robotic arm with clearances are analyzed concerning the contact and operation state variations. Then, the influence of clearance wear on the operational reliability of the robotic arm is studied as joint wear in the robotic arm contains interval uncertainty. To provide the uncertainty factors caused by the interval, we introduce Chebyshev functions to describe the dynamic response uncertainty and reliability. The non-probabilistic reliability index is given to evaluate the reliability of the robotic arm based on the stress intensity interference theory. Lastly, to improve operational accuracy and reliability, a novel compound control strategy containing collision force feedforward and PD feedback is carried out. It is compared with the traditional PD control strategy. Also, the sensitivity and robustness of the proposed compound control strategies are discussed. The results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively enhance the dynamics precision and reliability of the robotic arm, with satisfactory robustness.

  abstract  = {Deep excavations in urban areas may cause excessive ground deformations, leading to potential damage to the surrounding buildings. To prevent such problems, some techniques, such as the anchored wall systems, are used as a supporting method. This study, based on a large number of data produced by FE simulations and using the MARS approach, first presents a straightforward relation that can predict the maximum horizontal displacement of the anchored wall systems. Then, a simple predictive relation using MARS is established for developing a unique stiffness parameter. Finally, a novel design procedure based on the proposed MARS models, the stiffness parameter, geometric relationships, and recommendations from the FHWA is developed. By following this procedure, one can reasonably estimate the lengths of the anchors, their spacing, and tensile forces. Furthermore, the maximum horizontal displacement of the excavation wall can be accurately predicted and compared with the real value for better safety control of the construction procedure.},

  abstract  = {The exponential increase in the number of wires needed for the deployment of industrial applications in production lines combined with the complexity of the application development using proprietary protocols, shifted manufacturers towards new directions. One such direction that is also reducing the system configuration and maintenance cost is the use of wireless connectivity. Nevertheless, industrial wireless applications face significant challenges, as communication channel interference, loss of bandwidth and the out-of-order delivery or loss of packets. Therefore, they can not meet their critical operational and non-operational requirements. To this end, several tools have been proposed for modeling and simulation of these applications, in order to solve their challenges before their actual deployment and execution in the system architecture. However, these tools do not provide the ability to validate their functional and non-functional requirements nor provide guarantees for resolving their challenges. This article presents a new methodology that is using formal methods to model industrial wireless applications and architectures, but also to validate the deployment feasibility for industrial applications on wireless architectures. The method is based on formal methods and is using the BIP (behavior, interaction, priority) framework and stochastic components which represent the application and the wireless architecture at different levels. The methodology is applied in an industrial control system, that is responsible for electricity production from hydro sources. The experiments illustrate the realistic behavior of the developed models in comparison to the real system as well as allow to validate the feasibility of wireless architectural deployment for industrial applications through pragmatic quantitative and qualitative requirements.},

In this paper, we propose an image segmentation model based on Hellinger distance for local region intensity fitting (HD-LRIF). The method defines two different metrics based on the Hellinger distance and constructs a new data fitting term to segment the image efficiently by minimizing the energy function. In addition, our method is independent of the initial contour and the segmentation results consistently obtain high accuracy. The experimental results show that the HD-LRIF model is far superior to state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it can effectively filter the noise interference, thus enhancing robustness and improving the accuracy of image segmentation in general.},

  abstract  = {Flood and waterlogging hazards occur more frequently owing to global climate change and rapid development of urbanization in recent years, especially in the cities. To understand the research advances of urban flood and waterlogging disasters, this study systematically reviewed literature published during the period of 1998—2022 based on the bibliometric method and multi-dimensional clustering analysis of keywords. The databases (e.g. Web of Science and CNKI) were chosen and a total of 374 original articles were retrieved for data analysis from 1998 to 2022. The results indicated that the number of papers published in English and Chinese for urban flood disasters research showed an upward trend in the study period, especially after 2016. The keyword analysis indicated that the English and Chinese keywords such as “urban flood”, “urban flooding”, and “climate change” were areas of intense research interest in this field in the past twenty years. The study process of urban flood disasters could be divided into three stages, namely the initial stage from 1998 to 2008, the development stage from 2009 to 2016, and the prosperity stage from 2017 to 2022. Finally, under the background of global climate change and urbanization, the development trends on urban flood disasters were summarized. This study aims at providing a comprehensive landscape of urban flood and waterlogging disasters research and may be helpful for researchers to identify key information and the recent status in this field.},

This paper experimentally investigates cold and warm press flattening of waste sheet metal for enabling remanufacturing. Samples of stainless steel, aluminium alloy, and low carbon steel were bent to various internal angles using v-die air bending operations. Then, flattening tests were conducted with a hydraulic press, with tools capable of heating up to 300 °C. The process parameters included dwell force, dwell time, and tool temperature. The target final angle after load release is set at 180°, but the flattening process typically induces springforward, and the final angle is generally larger than 180°. Springforward can be mitigated by using warm flattening conditions with all the tested materials. It can also be reduced if superposing a steel mesh between the top flattening die and the sheet. The paper demonstrates and explains the mechanical effects of the flattening process.},

  abstract  = {The imperative shift toward sustainable development mandates a revolutionary transformation in the transportation sector. While the transition from internal combustion engines to electric motors represents a pivotal step, its ecological impact may fall short of expectations. This undertaking is motivated by the recognition that a truly impactful transition necessitates intricate strategies, addressing resource consumption during manufacturing and minimizing post-use waste. This literature review is dedicated to enhancing the framework of circular strategies within the realm of electric motors, with a specific focus on remanufacturing. The objective is to cultivate a conscientious approach to product development, primarily centered on the four key pillars of circularity: reuse, remanufacture, upgrade, and recycle. The primary goal is to furnish a comprehensive overview of the myriad possibilities associated with reusing products, either in parts or as a whole. Upon introducing the circular approach, this review underscores pivotal enabling technologies essential for a successful transition. These include inspection, disassembly, rewinding, and demagnetization. The ensuing discussion delves into the technological challenges faced and presents cutting-edge solutions poised to redefine the landscape. The concluding section extends the perspective to the future, introducing innovative studies and solutions still in their developmental stages. This review is tailored for decision-makers, policymakers, and researchers, providing them with a valuable overview and facilitating discussions to propel our society toward a sustainable and responsible future in electric motor technology.},

Due to the double-loop procedure for the mixed uncertainty quantification (UQ), the computational cost is daunting. Therefore, this study proposes a new polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method for UQ problems with random variables and evidence variables. To enhance the computational accuracy and efficiency of the PCE model, a new low-discrepancy sequence sampling method is proposed, and the sample weights are redefined according to the Christoffel prior. Then, a weighted sparse Bayesian learning method is developed to construct the PCE model with a small sample size. Finally, the proposed method is verified through two numerical examples and one practical engineering problem and compared with three common surrogate methods. Results illustrate the proposed method has obvious advantages in computational accuracy and efficiency over the compared methods, and is powerful for the UQ problems with aleatory and epistemic uncertainties.},

This study addresses these challenges by enhancing a pose-based feature fusion framework with body part-based analysis, aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness of cerebral palsy detection in infants. Current literature predominantly focuses on either body-part information or frequency and motion data, neglecting the potential benefits of combining both. To bridge this gap, this research integrates a body part-based ensemble framework with the existing pose-based model. This approach involves a comprehensive analysis of body part-based features in both the time and frequency domains, capturing subtle nuances in movement patterns that may be indicative of cerebral palsy.

As a response, a host of cyber-security approaches exists. While useful, these approaches exhibit shortcomings such as an inclination to be fragmented, not accounting for up-to-date organizational data, focusing on singular vulnerabilities only, and being reactive, i.e., focusing on patching up vulnerabilities in current systems. The paper presents and evaluates a modeling method aiming to address those shortcomings and to support security by design with a focus on the electricity sector. The proposed modeling method encompasses a multi-level reference model reconstructing and integrating existing initiatives and supporting top-down and bottom-up analyses.

 model, where we add two complex singlet scalars, three right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHN), and a vector-like dark fermion to the Standard Model (SM), all non-trivially charged under the extra gauge symmetry. The model offers an easy resolution to the muon ( g – 2) anomaly, which fixes the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the two-zero minor structure in the RHN mass matrix provides successful predictions for neutrino oscillation parameters, including the Dirac phase. The extended scalar sector can easily induce first-order phase transitions. We identify all possible phase transition patterns in the three-dimensional field space. We quantify the associated gravitational waves from the sound wave source and demonstrate that the signatures can be observed in future space-based experiments. We find that strong first-order phase transitions require large values of scalar quartic couplings which constrain the scalar dark matter (DM) relic density to a maximum of 10^−2 and 10^−5 when we consider the DM direct detection bound. Nonetheless, the model successfully explains the DM relic density via contribution from the vector-like dark fermion. We show the allowed range of the model parameters that can address all the beyond SM issues targeted in this study.},

Extensive numerical simulations on these continuum and discrete growth systems are performed in the presence of long-range temporal correlations, and the scaling exponents are obtained correspondingly. We find that these correlated growth systems exhibit high dependence on the temporal correlation exponent within the large temporal correlated regimes, and there exist non-trivial scaling properties in the correlated DT and WV models. Our results also show that the scaling exponents in these linear and nonlinear MBE growth equations are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the saturated surface morphologies are compared qualitatively through simulating numerically these continuum and discrete growth systems in the presence of long-range temporal correlations. Generally, as the temporal correlation exponent increases, the surface heights of these correlated discrete and continuum growth systems exhibit evident increasing trends. Likewise, with the temporal correlation exponent increasing, the surface morphologies of the modified DT and WV models undergo a gradual transition from self-affine hills to sharp peaks, while the growing surfaces of the correlated MH and VLDS equations gradually become relatively smooth.},

It is concluded, after comparing the two that in the studied period and in the near future, energy efficiency continues to grow exponentially but at a slower rate than that established by Koomey's Law (maximum energy efficiency doubles every 2.29 years instead of every 1.57 years). Another interesting result is that energy efficiency grows at a slower rate (doubling every 2.29 years) than performance (doubling every 1.85 years).},

This paper proposes a novel rank-aggregation algorithm which leverages graph theory and information fusion to model inter-element relationships and combine ranked lists effectively. By constructing a rankers’ similarity graph and employing spectral clustering, the algorithm identifies top-performing rankers, whose rankings are combined using the random forest algorithm, which is applied several times to produce different combined rankings and score them based on the average expertise of included rankers. Finally, information fusion theory is employed to aggregate the ensemble of rankers’ outputs through the optimistic and pessimistic exponential ordered weighted averaging operators. Experimental results on LETOR4.0 datasets demonstrate noticeable improvements compared to baselines, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed algorithm using only a limited number of rankers.},

  abstract  = {Developing an anthropogenic carbon dioxides (CO_2) emissions monitoring and verification support (MVS) capacity is essential to support the Global Stocktake (GST) and ratchet up Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The 2019 IPCC refinement proposes top-down inversed CO_2 emissions, primarily from fossil fuel (FFCO_2), as a viable emission dataset. Despite substantial progress in directly inferring FFCO_2 emissions from CO_2 observations, substantial challenges remain, particularly in distinguishing local CO_2 enhancements from the high background due to the long atmospheric lifetime. Alternatively, using short-lived and co-emitted nitrogen dioxide (NO_2) as a proxy in FFCO_2 emission inversion has gained prominence. This methodology is broadly categorized into plume-based and emission ratios (ERs)-based inversion methods. In the plume-based methods, NO_2 observations act as locators, constraints, and validators for deciphering CO_2 plumes downwind of sources, typically at point source and city scales. The ERs-based inversion approach typically consists of two steps: inferring NO_2-based nitrogen oxides (NO_ x ) emissions and converting NO_ x to CO_2 emissions using CO_2-to-NO_ x ERs. While integrating NO_2 observations into FFCO_2 emission inversion offers advantages over the direct CO_2-based methods, uncertainties persist, including both structural and data-related uncertainties. Addressing these uncertainties is a primary focus for future research, which includes deploying next-generation satellites and developing advanced inversion systems. Besides, data caveats are necessary when releasing data to users to prevent potential misuse. Advancing NO_2-based CO_2 emission inversion requires interdisciplinary collaboration across multiple communities of remote sensing, emission inventory, transport model improvement, and atmospheric inversion algorithm development.},

  abstract  = {Against the background of global warming, the losses caused by hydrological extreme events are becoming more serious. Understanding how to quantitatively attribute the trends of river discharge and extreme events will play an important role in climate change adaptation. The main objective of this study is to analyze recent trends in river discharge and annual maximum daily runoff in Chinese catchments and attribute them to the ongoing climate change, where possible. For that, 20 catchments in China, which are not influenced or influenced only slightly by water management, are chosen as study areas. Then, we use the long-term observational climate dataset GSWP3-W5E5 from ISIMIP3a as factual climate and a detrended climate dataset based on it as counterfactual climate to drive the hydrological model for quantification of climate change contribution to trends in mean and extreme runoff. Our analysis shows that the trends in annual discharge over the period 1961–2019 in eight catchments (all located in western China) represented by five stations in the Upper Yellow and Upper Yangtze, Kaqun station in the Tarim-Yeerqiang, Changdu station in the Lancangjiang and Xindi station in the Heihe can be attributed to climate change. As well, it is shown that climate change enhanced annual maximum daily runoff in the Upper Yellow and Upper Yangtze River basins. The results provide a new understanding of the degree to which observed changes in mean and extreme runoff were induced by the observed changes in climate, which may improve adaptation to climate change in China.},

  abstract  = {Super large-sized cities and very large-sized cities (“mega-cities” for short) have become the backbone of China's socio-economic development, but they also face outstanding challenges of "urban diseases" due to their high concentration. In comparison to their foreign counterparts, China's mega-cities possess unique characteristics such as rapid growth, high population density, and large numbers of residents. They naturally have the attributes of metropolitan areas due to an administrative management system of an urban system within city territory. Promoting coordinated spatial governance of mega-cities via spatial organization of metropolitan areas not only helps mega-cities better allocate resources at a larger scope and helps expedite the transformation of development patterns, but is also crucial for better implementing new-type urbanization strategies. In response to the issues in China’s previous research and practices related to mega-cities and metropolitan areas, leveraging the “Critical Technology for Spatial Optimization of Metropolitan Areas of City Clusters” of the national key R   D plan in the “14th Five-year Plan” period, we have employed a scientific approach that combines data and models to propose spatial governance strategies. These strategies encompass both the overall metropolitan area level and the cross-border regional level. Our primary focus lies in optimizing the spatial layout of the “three domains” – ecological space, production space, and living space, facilitating functional dispersal, enhancing spatial patterns, adjusting land use structures and spatial resource allocation, coordinating rail transit and the organization of functions along transit lines, and innovating service management for improvement of administrative efficiency. Through the implementation of these diverse measures, we aim to establish a comprehensive composite collaborative system.},

  abstract  = {A compact low-profile end-fire antenna based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) has been proposed. At the junction, where the antenna connects to the transmission line, there is a 180 degree balun structure for achieving end-fire radiation. Subsequently, two symmetrical transmission lines are introduced, with two parasitic patches loaded on the transmission lines for optimizing the S-parameters of the antenna. The addition of the balun structure ensures that the SSPP units operate as dipoles within the frequency band. Furthermore, the dispersion parameters of the SSPP units are simulated and analysed. The Hansen-Woodyard condition is applied to derive the maximum end-fire gain at the terminal. The results show that the end-fire antenna operates in the frequency range of 18–20 GHz, with an average gain of 10.1 dBi and a peak gain of 10.6 dBi. The proposed end-fire antenna is miniaturized and low-profile compared to conventional antennas.The simulation and measurement results are in good agreement within the operating frequency band, thus showing that the proposed design has a great potential for future wireless communication applications.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the impact of the carbon emission trading pilot policies on air quality improvements across 283 prefecture-level cities in China from 2014 to 2021. Through a quasi-natural experiment, it employs Difference in Differences (DID), Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Differences (PSM-DID), and Difference in Difference in Differences (DDD) models to evaluate the policy’s effectiveness. The results are as follows. (1) The carbon emission trading pilot policy has a substantial impact on reducing the air pollution index in pilot areas, highlighting the considerable potential of carbon emission trading policies to improve air quality. (2) The study also highlights the significance of considering both substitution and scale effects in assessing the effectiveness of carbon emission trading in relation to regional industrial structures. (3) While the carbon emission trading policy does not consistently decrease energy consumption per GDP unit, it emphasizes the importance of fostering green innovation and investing in environmental initiatives for effective air quality management. (4) Regional variations in the policy's effects are observed, with more prominent improvements seen in western and central regions as well as in large and medium-sized cities. This paper concludes by emphasizing the necessity for future research to delve into the long-term environmental and economic impacts of carbon emission trading policies, aiming to explore the sustainability of air quality enhancements and the adaptability of various industries to these frameworks.},

  abstract  = {The influence of the low-frequency amplitude-modulated excitation on the dynamic behaviors in an externally driven Rayleigh-van der Pol-Duffing system (EDRVDS) is investigated theoretically and numerically. First, we propose two bursting oscillation types of the EDRVDS without the low-frequency amplitude-modulated excitation and explore their mechanisms by using the fast/slow decomposition analysis. Then, by regarding the low-frequency cosine function as a generalized slow variable, we transform the driven EDRVDS into a formal autonomous nonlinear equation. Next, we investigate the influence of the low-frequency amplitude-modulated excitation on the two bursting oscillations from the perspectives of the coefficient n equals to odd and even numbers, respectively. Especially, some detailed problems, such as the ups and downs in the stable equilibrium sets, the ups and downs in the shapes of the limit cycles, symmetric and asymmetric of the bifurcation structures, are explored clearly. By this effort, we realize the amplitude-modulation of the oscillations in the excited states and silent states successfully. Moreover, we have the aid of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to guarantee the preciseness of the analysis results.},

Malaria is one of the major health threats in Africa, and the risk of transmission is projected to be exacerbated by global warming. Rwanda experienced an 11-fold increase in malaria incidence from 2011 to 2015 despite extensive funding and implementation of control measures. Here, we focus on Rwanda as a case study and simulate monthly malaria incidence between 2010 and 2015, employing an ensemble learning method. Next, we project future malaria prevalence using shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). We find that the projected increases in temperature and precipitation may shift malaria transmission risk to the highlands of western and northern Rwanda. These two regions that currently experience low malaria transmission. The seasonal effects of malaria incidence may be less apparent from January to June, and the peak season for malaria transmission in the highlands could occur one month earlier. Our findings highlight the impacts of climate change on malaria epidemics in Rwanda, which have implications for other world regions.},

  abstract  = {The capability to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into business processes (BPs) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, offering unprecedented opportunities for organisations to enhance their operational efficiency and productivity. Interacting with the physical world and leveraging real-world data to make more informed business decisions is of greatest interest, and the idea of IoT-enhanced BPs promises to automate and improve business activities and permit them to adapt to the physical environment of execution. Nonetheless, combining these two domains is challenging, and it requires new modelling methods that do not increase notation complexity and provide independent execution between the process and the underlying device technology. In this work, we propose FloBP , a model-driven engineering approach separating concerns between the IoT and BPs, providing a structured and systematic approach to modelling and executing IoT-enhanced BPs. Applying the separation of concerns through an interdisciplinary team is needed to ensure that the approach covers all necessary process aspects, including technological and modelling ones. The FloBP approach is based on modelling tools and a microservices architecture to deploy BPMN models, and it facilitates integration with the physical world, providing flexibility to support multiple IoT device technologies and their evolution. A smart canteen scenario describes and evaluates the approach’s feasibility and its possible adoption by various stakeholders. The performed evaluation concludes that the application of FloBP facilitates the modelling and development of IoT-enhanced BPs by sharing and reusing knowledge among IoT and BP experts.},

  volume    = {15},
  abstract  = {The configuration and equipment of an aircraft cabin has a significant impact on the passenger’s flight experience. To meet the needs of passengers and improve the flight experience, airlines repeatedly demand customised adaptations to the cabin design. The implementation of these changes requires a high degree of flexibility in production and can lead to difficulties in setting up a fixed final assembly line. In addition, unforeseen events and changes in the OEMs’ supply chain require a rapid response in aircraft production to be able to deliver on time. Digitalisation in product development and production planning makes it possible to overcome these challenges and makes an important contribution to flexibility, time and cost efficiency. This paper presents a digital approach to modelling and flexible planning of assembly processes of the cabin. To this end, aircraft design data is automatically linked to the assembly system to react quickly to design changes in the assembly planning process. The integration is realised in a system architecture model depicted with the systems modelling language (SysML). The architecture model follows the formal process description defined in VDI3682. A planning algorithm then uses the production architecture parameters to optimise the assembly processes, e.g. in terms of time. The approach presented is demonstrated using the example of scheduling the pre-assembly processes of the "crown module". The latter includes all structural and functional components above the window panels, such as overhead bins, electrics and air conditioning. The results show how changes in aircraft and cabin design or in the production plant and resources can be flexibly evaluated. This allows conceptual changes to be evaluated and traded before the cabin design is frozen and transferred to real production. These advantages contribute to the time and cost optimisation of aircraft production. This work thus makes a valuable contribution to the further development of digital solutions in aircraft production.},

  abstract  = {An improved adaptive Kriging model-based metamodel importance sampling (IS) reliability analysis method is proposed to increase the efficiency of failure probability calculation. First, the silhouette plot method is introduced to judge the optimal number of clusters for k -means to establish the IS density function, thus avoiding the problem of only assuming clusters arbitrarily. Second, considering the prediction uncertainty of the Kriging model, a novel learning function established from the uncertainty of failure probability is proposed for adaptive Kriging model establishment. The proposed learning function is established based on the variance information of failure probability. The major benefit of the proposed learning function is that the distribution characteristic of the IS density function is considered, thus fully reflecting the impact of the IS function on active learning. Finally, the coefficient of variation (COV) information of failure probability is adopted to define a novel stopping criterion for learning function. The performance of the proposed method is verified through different numerical examples. The findings demonstrate that the refined learning strategy effectively identifies samples with substantial contributions to failure probability, showcasing commendable convergence. Particularly notable is its capacity to significantly reduce function call volumes with heightened accuracy for scenarios featuring variable dimensions below 10.},

  abstract  = {Cavitation erosion is a pervasive issue in hydraulic machinery and ocean engineering, characterized by the collapse of bubbles, micro-jetting, and impact erosion, all exhibiting strong transient, microscale, and fluid–solid coupling features. Understanding these phenomena is essential for elucidating the mechanisms behind erosion and for developing strategies to prevent wear damage. Recognizing the limitations of conventional numerical methods, this study employs the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to develop a fluid–solid coupling model that simulates cavitation erosion at the bubble scale. The Lagrangian and mesh-free nature of SPH make it well-suited for tracking the transient processes of asymmetric bubble collapse, jet formation, and the subsequent impact on elastic–plastic materials. A comprehensive fluid–solid coupling SPH model is constructed, encompassing bubbles, surrounding liquids, and elastic–plastic materials. This model includes a compressible multiphase SPH approach for simulating the interaction between highly compressible bubbles and liquids. To address gas phase over-compression during bubble collapse, a modified particle regeneration technique (PRT) is introduced, allowing for automatic adjustment of particle resolution in the gas domain as it expands or compresses. For the solid simulation, an elasto-plastic constitutive model and a failure model are integrated into the SPH framework to describe material deformation and failure due to microjet impacts. These enhancements enable the simulation of the entire cavitation erosion process within a unified, mesh-free context. The SPH model is validated through simulating bubble collapse and jetting induced by shock waves. It is then applied to investigate the dynamics of cavitation erosion near both rigid and elastic–plastic materials, providing quantitative analysis of the erosion process. The outcomes of this research contribute significantly to our understanding of cavitation erosion mechanisms and offer a robust computational tool for predicting and mitigating erosion damage in related engineering applications.},

  abstract  = {In 2020, China pledged carbon reduction targets at the United Nations: peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Research and prediction of regional carbon emissions are crucial for achieving these dual carbon targets across China. This study aims to construct an indicator system for regional carbon emissions and utilize it for forecasting. Analyzing carbon emission data from a specific area in Hainan Province from 2010 to 2020, we established an indicator system. Using the interpretable SHAP model, we assessed indicator importance and trends. Employing an improved STIRPAT model with partial least squares regression to address multicollinearity among influencing factors, we developed a carbon emission prediction model. Based on this, we forecasted carbon emissions from 2021 to 2060 in the specified area under three scenarios: natural, baseline, and ambitious. The results show that the growth of resident population and per capita GDP has the most significant promoting effect on carbon emissions in the region while optimizing industrial structure, energy consumption structure, and reducing energy intensity will inhibit carbon emissions. The prediction results indicate that in the natural scenario, regional carbon emissions will peak in 2035, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 is not feasible, while the baseline scenario and ambitious scenario can achieve the dual carbon targets on time or even earlier. The research results of this article provide a reference method for predicting carbon emissions in other regions and a guide for future regional emission reduction.},

  abstract  = {To satisfy the requirements of individual design and rapid performance evaluation of complex products, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to build a performance evaluation model and perform the rapid evaluation of design schemes. This approach consists of a surrogate model and knowledge graph (KG). Firstly, the KG of complex electromechanical products is established by Web Ontology Language to provide information about parts and evaluation indexes for the sampling process. It includes building ontology and writing inference and query rules at the framework level. Secondly, based on the sample points, a dynamics model is built and used for simulation. Using the Design of Experiments, the variables that have the greatest impact are found. The relevant variables will be input into the model to obtain the data set. According to the data set, a surrogate model based on the radial basis function is built as a performance evaluation model, which can improve computing efficiency to achieve evaluation results rapidly. In this study, the bogie design is used as a test case to evaluate the proposed method. And the results show that it can improve design efficiency for design issues such as part selection.},

  abstract  = {Theta oscillations support memory formation, but their exact contribution to the communication between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus is unknown. We tested the functional relevance of theta oscillations as a communication link between both areas for memory formation using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Healthy, young participants learned two lists of Dutch-German word pairs and retrieved them immediately and with a 30-min delay. In the encoding group (N = 30), tACS was applied during the encoding of list 1. List 2 was used to test stimulation aftereffects. In the retrieval group (N = 23), we stimulated during the delayed recall. In both groups, we applied tACS bilaterally at prefrontal and tempo-parietal sites, using either individualized theta frequency or 15 Hz (as control), according to a within-subject design. Stimulation with theta-tACS did not alter overall learning performance. An exploratory analysis revealed that immediate recall improved when word-pairs were learned after theta-tACS (list 2). Applying theta-tACS during retrieval had detrimental effects on memory. No changes in the power of the respective frequency bands were observed. Our results do not support the notion that impacting the communication between PFC and the hippocampus during a task by bilateral tACS improves memory. However, we do find evidence that direct stimulation had a trend for negatively interfering effects during immediate and delayed recall. Hints for beneficial effects on memory only occurred with aftereffects of the stimulation. Future studies need to further examine the effects during and after stimulation on memory formation.},

  abstract  = {In today’s dynamic business environment, organizations constantly change their business models to respond to emerging digital technologies and shifting customer expectations. It is a fundamental challenge to translate these changes into the organization’s operating model. When organizations redesign their business models, significant adjustments to the operating model and its underlying business processes are necessary to ensure the effective delivery of the value proposition to customers. Existing research falls short in detailing how changes to the business model at the tactical level impact the operating model at the operational level. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Compass Method. This method provides guidance for decision-makers at the tactical and operational levels in identifying necessary changes to their operating model using a set of operating model design cards. The method has been developed following the design science research methodology and is grounded in extant knowledge from both business model research and process management research. Three rounds of design and evaluation of the method were completed in multiple settings. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between business models, operating models, and business processes, paving the way for the development of complementary methods and tools to further investigate this relationship.},

  abstract  = {In the era of the internet, people are increasingly interested in highly personalized customization, which has been leading the global industry to transform from “Enterprise centered Mass Manufacturing” to “User centered Mass Customization”. In recent decades, ontology-based semantic models have been used for semantic association description and syntax consistency alignment of product structures. However, the description of industrial terminology and general concepts has difficulty achieving accurate end-to-end matching of personalized user customization requirements and manufacturing capabilities. This requires detailed descriptions of process standards, component/assembly/part specifications, etc. Therefore, we propose the Abstraction-Instance-Capability (AIC) model based on a knowledge graph, which is a multigrained and multiview industrial knowledge model. By modeling industrial knowledge at a deeper level from various perspectives and by considering the expression of the relationships between knowledge, an industrial knowledge graph was constructed to support personalized customization. This graph can be used for personalized customization plan generation and other related operations, such as Design BOM (Bill of Materials) modification and verification. First, a meta-object facility (MOF)-based meta-model is defined for AIC model design. Second, the proposed model is used to define a multiview structure for modeling knowledge from various perspectives. Such a design realizes efficient industrial knowledge retrieval from various aspects, such as manufacturing resource retrieval, and production capacity analysis. Finally, in this paper we validate operability and introduce two case studies to demonstrate that the model has good performance in the recommendation of components (BOM modification) and the verification of personalized customization schemes (BOM verification).},

  abstract  = {Slope reliability is of great importance in geotechnical engineering, and it is susceptible to various factors, such as slope cutting and rainfall. Currently, how the copula dependence structure affects the reliability of cutting slopes under rainfall conditions is still an open question. This study investigates the influence of copula dependence structure on the reliability analysis of a real slope, considering the slope cutting and rainfall characteristics (i.e., rainfall intensity, duration, and pattern). The Gaussian, Plackett, Frank, and No.16 copulas are first employed to model the joint probability distribution of the measured soil strength parameters. The optimal copula is subsequently identified using Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion. The probability of failure ( P _ f ) and the distribution of critical slip surface (CSS) for different slope cutting and rainfall conditions are then obtained within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the copula dependence between shear strengths has significant influence on the P _ f for the cutting slope under rainfall conditions. The commonly used Gaussian copula may underestimate the P _ f , while the No.16 copula would overestimate the P _ f for different slope cutting angles and rainfall intensities, durations and patterns. The differences in P _ f obtained by different copula functions decrease with the increase of cutting angle, cutting distance and rainfall intensity. Furthermore, the differences in P _ f obtained by different copula functions show little variations with changes in rainfall duration and pattern. Although the copula function has a significant influence on the P _ f , it has negligible influence on CSS. This study provides a practical tool for the selection of copula function and valuable insights for slope design and management under slope cutting and rainfall conditions.},

  abstract  = {Background Agricultural irrigation is an important practice to safeguard crops against drought and enhance grain yield in arid regions. The Hexi Corridor, known as a classic arid region, faces significant pressure on agricultural production and food security due to the scarcity of water resources. There is an urgent need to investigate agricultural water use of the irrigated regions. Water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to actual evapotranspiration (ET), serves as a valuable indicator linking carbon assimilation and water loss. It enables the quantification of areas where water can be utilized more effectively. However, the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of WUE and driving mechanism in the irrigated areas of the Hexi Corridor remain unclear. Results This study used GPP calculated by a light use efficiency model (EF-LUE), ET estimated by an ETMonitor model and irrigated cropland maps across China (IrriMap_CN) to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated cropland WUE and its controlling factors in the Hexi Corridor from 2001 to 2018. The results are as following: (1) The average annual WUE was approximately 1.34 ± 0.38 g C kg^−1 H_2O yr^−1, with an increasing trend of 0.012 g C kg^−1 H_2O yr^−1, and faster growth observed during 2011–2018 compared to 2001–2010. (2) The contribution of GPP to WUE trends and WUE interannual variability (IAV) was greater than that of ET. (3) The dominant climatic factors of WUE IAV in the Hexi Corridor were SPEI, precipitation, and soil moisture. (4) The standardized Structural Equation Model (SEM), incorporating the relationship between WUE and factors such as water, energy, NDVI, and water-saving irrigation, explained 81},

(2) How do different building typologies modify pedestrian-level wind behaviors and the surrounding buildings’ outdoor and indoor ventilation potentials?

  abstract  = {A deep geological repository is considered an appropriate option for disposal of radioactive waste containing long-lived radionuclides. Engineered barriers’ degradation and radionuclide transport strongly depend on the conditions in the repository. This work presents the assessment of the geochemical evolution in a radioactive long-lived intermediate-level waste disposal cell constructed in granite. The considered cell consists of cemented waste packages, cementitious backfill and several meters of host rock. Three abstracted reactive transport models of different complexity were developed: a 1D model and a 2D model considering transport by advection and diffusion and a 2D model with diffusive transfer only. The changes in the pH, the pore water composition and the materials’ mineralogical composition were observed. The modelling results indicate an increase in the pH in the disposal cell due to leaching of alkalis, which is followed by the dissolution of portlandite and the precipitation of calcite at the granite-vault backfill boundary. The obtained changes in the pH indicate that the geochemical alterations in the disposal cell proceed very slowly. Such a slow degradation could be the result of the formation of the higher pH zone upstream from the disposal tunnel. The advection–diffusion models in 1D and 2D geometries produced similar results. However, the 2D model also identified spatial peculiarities in the changes of the geochemical environment. Comparison of the pure diffusive case results with the advection–diffusion cases demonstrated that both processes are relevant in the analysed disposal cell.},

  abstract  = {The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the latest evidence of an epidemic disease resulting in an extraordinary number of infections and claimed several lives, along with extensive economic and social consequences. In response to the emergency situation, countries introduced different policies to address the situation, with different levels of efficacy. This paper outlines the protocol for developing a model to analyze the burden of COVID-19 in Iran and the effect of policies on the incidence and cumulative death of the disease. The importance of the model lies in the fact that no study, according to the authors’ best knowledge, tried to quantify the impact of the disease on Iran society and the impact of various implemented interventions on disease control. Based on a systematic review of COVID-19 prediction models and expert interviews, we developed a system dynamics model that not only includes an epidemic part but also considers the impact of various policies implemented by the Ministry of Health. The epidemic model estimates the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in Iran. The model also intends to evaluate the effect of implemented policies on these outcomes. The model reflects the continuum of COVID-19 infection and care in Iran (of which some of its elements are unique) and key activities and decisions in delivering care. The model is calibrated and validated using data published by the Ministry of Health of Iran. Finally, the study aims to provide evidence of the impact of interventions intended to curb COVID-19 in Iran. Insights provided by the model will be necessary for controlling either future waves of the disease or similar future pandemics.},

Although previous studies have identified Indian Ocean (IO) warming as the major cause of heavy Meiyu-Baiu rainfall, it failed to predict the record-breaking rainfall in July 2020. Synthesizing observational analysis, large-ensemble climate simulations, and atmospheric simulations, we show that sea-ice loss in the Kara Sea in May can intensify the IO warming-induced heavy Meiyu-Baiu rainfall and well explains the record-breaking rainfall in July 2020. In the precondition of IO warming, sea-ice loss tends to prolong Meiyu-Baiu season and strengthen convective activity over the Meiyu-Baiu region, thereby enhancing the IO warming-induced heavy Meiyu-Baiu rainfall by  50},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an efficient Kriging-assisted improved cross-entropy (ICE) method for random-interval hybrid reliability analysis. This method employs Kriging to substitute for the projection outlines of limit state surface and incrementally updates the Kriging model within the final layer samples of ICE. A novel learning function that combines both the lower and upper confidence bounds for extremum searching is proposed to identify samples on the projection outlines. Additionally, an error-based stopping criterion (EBSC) is proposed to avoid unnecessary updates to the Kriging model. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through four benchmark examples. Furthermore, the method is applied to two practical engineering scenarios: the strength reliability analysis of a bogie and the resonance reliability analysis of an axially functionally graded material (FGM) pipeline. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves high levels of efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Humanity has long since used models, in different shapes and forms, to understand, redesign, communicate about, and shape, the world around us; including many different social, economic, biological, chemical, physical, and digital aspects. This has resulted in a wide range of modeling practices . When the models as used in such modeling practices have a key role to play in the activities in which these practices are ‘embedded’, the need emerges to consider the effectiveness and efficiency of such processes, and speak about modeling capabilities . In the latter situation, it also becomes relevant to develop a thorough understanding of the artifacts involved in modeling practices/capabilities. One context in which models play (an increasingly) important role is model-driven systems development , including software engineering, information systems engineering, business process engineering, enterprise engineering, and enterprise architecture management. In such a context, we come across a rich variety of modeling related artifacts, such as views, diagrams, programs, animations, specifications, etc. In this paper, which is actually part of an ongoing ‘journey’ in which we aim to gain deeper insights into the foundations of modeling, we take a fundamental look at the variety of modeling related artifacts as used in the context of model-driven (systems) development, while also presenting an associated framework for understanding , synthesizing the insights we obtained during the ‘journey’ so-far. In doing so, we will also argue that the aforementioned artifacts are actually specific kinds of models, albeit for fundamentally different purposes. The provided framework for understanding involves definitions of domain model , the Return on Modeling Effort (RoME), the conceptual fidelity of domain models, as well as views as a mechanism to manage the complexity of domain models.},

Given that the damage includes both viral infection of brain cells and immune system-related damage, here we investigate the involvement of cellular prion protein (PrP), which plays vital roles in neuroprotection and immune regulation. Using a murine model, we show the role of PrP in tempering neonatal T cell immunity during CMV infection. PrP-null mice exhibit enhanced viral control through elevated virus-specific CD8 T cell responses, leading to reduced viral titers and pathology. We further unravel the molecular mechanisms by showing CMV-induced upregulation followed by release of PrP via the metalloproteinase ADAM10, impairing CD8 T cell response specifically in neonates. Additionally, we confirm PrP downregulation in human CMV (HCMV)-infected fibroblasts, underscoring the broader relevance of our observations beyond the murine model. Furthermore, our study highlights how PrP, under the stress of viral pathogenesis, reveals its impact on neonatal immune modulation. The role of cellular prion protein (PrP) during CMV infection in newborns is not entirely clear. Here, the authors show that CMV-induced PrP release mediated by ADAM10 shedding impairs the neonatal antiviral response in mice by compromising CD8 T-cells leading to higher viral titers and more severe disease outcome.},

In this study, the vertical ultrasonic vibration cutting process of sapphire was simulated by the discrete element method, and the reasons for the expansion of sub-surface microcracks during the cutting process were revealed from the viewpoint of cutting force and stress. The results of the study show that the sub-surface microcracks in the cutting process are mainly caused by tensile stresses, and the tensile stresses increase with the increase of amplitude and frequency; as the amplitude and frequency increase, the degree of cutting force fluctuation, the depth of the sub-surface cracks, and the number of cracks increase more drastically; the tensile stress at smaller amplitudes is smaller than in normal cutting, and the location of the maximum tensile stress is closer to the machined surface, which inhibits the expansion of the sub-surface cracks. Finally, the vertical ultrasonic vibratory cutting and normal cutting sapphire experiments were comparatively studied, and the experimental results were in agreement with the simulation results. This research provides theoretical guidance for the realization of low damage and efficient processing of sapphire materials.},

  abstract  = {Scenario-based verification defines the current state of the art for examining a vessel’s control systems for reliability and safety. However, software updates after release can only be covered to a limited extent. To take changes to a deployed system into account, the design and test phase must be harmonized with the operational phase. For all phases, regulatory, technical and safety requirements provide the scope to which the development process and the scenario-based tests need to be aligned and whose specifications the System under Test (SuT) must adhere to during operation. For this reason, a procedure is needed that converts the requirements into a format that can be utilized across all phases and measured in a structured manner comparing the original system to the updated version. This work does so by combining scenario-based verification methods with formal composition and monitoring techniques based on contract-based design into an integrated development approach. It is shown how safety requirements can be transferred into a Verification Descriptor that in turn provides the foundation for the division into model-based system development, contract-based virtual integration testing and a scenario-based test environment. For the entire lifecycle of the System under Test (SuT) to be included, the extended scenario and contract descriptors are carried forward up to the operational phase, such that the previously defined properties of the SuT can be monitored and validated during runtime. The approach is designed alongside a minimal-viable system and evaluated on an actual implementation of a safety-critical maritime LiDAR-based positioning system.},

Within knowledge transfer, the Absorptive Capacity (ACAP) of Knowledge Recipients (KR) emerges as an unresolved barrier. ACAP is the dynamic capability to absorb knowledge and surpass the aggregation of individual ACAP within an organization. However, more research is needed on individual-level ACAP and its implications for bridging the gap between individual and organizational knowledge transfer. To address this gap, this study employs Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) as a simulation method to replicate individual ACAP within an organization, facilitating the examination of knowledge transfer dynamics. ABM allows for the detailed analysis of interactions between individual KRs and the organizational environment, revealing how uninterrupted time and other factors influence knowledge absorption. The implications of the study are that ABM provides specific insights into how individual ACAP affects organizational learning and performance, emphasizing the importance of uninterrupted time for KR to achieve optimal knowledge exploitation and highlighting the need for organizational practices and policies that foster environments conducive to knowledge absorption.},

  abstract  = {This study reveals the simulation results of a regional ocean-atmosphere coupled model (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave Sediment Transport Modeling System, COAWST) for the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) East Asia Phase II, which covers a period of 21 years (1989–2009) at a horizontal resolution of 25 km. The coupled simulation (CPL) and the uncoupled atmospheric simulation (UNCPL) are compared with observations to assess their capability of capturing the climatology characteristics over East Asia. The simulated sea surface temperature (SST) in CPL is generally overestimated (underestimated) in summer (winter) over most CORDEX-EA-II regions. Both CPL and UNCPL can capture the spatial patterns of seasonal air temperature over East Asia well. However, they both simulate cold biases of the winter temperature over most regions of China. CPL can reduce the cold biases over certain regions, which may be related to the increased cloud cover reflecting more longwave radiation to the ground. Additionally, CPL improves the simulation results of summer precipitation, diminishing the dry biases over northern Bay of Bengal and South China Sea. This improvement may be related to the better description of moisture transportation and precipitable water. Furthermore, The CPL experiment can better simulate the inter-annual variability of summer precipitation and the relationship between SST and precipitation, especially over the South China Sea and Philippines Sea. CPL also captures the northward propagation and amplitude of boreal summer intra-seasonal oscillation precipitation anomalies more accurately. These findings highlight the importance of ocean-atmosphere coupling processes to simulate multiscale climate changes in the CORDEX-EA-II regions. • The COAWST regional coupled model enhances the simulation of surface air temperature and precipitation climatology over CORDEX East Asia. • The coupled model effectively represents the inter-annual variability of summer precipitation over most western Northern Pacific regions. • The coupled model provides a more accurate depiction of the northward propagation and amplitude of BSISO precipitation anomalies.},

Several studies have focused on the usability evaluation of groupware, yet, both in terms of science and practice, there is a lack of a method that, like existing empirical single-user methods, can be routinely applied in software development practice. The new Team Usability Testing method differs from previous methods in that it is an empirical method for evaluating synchronous (real-time) collaborative software that explores the team usability problems with the help of real or potential users. The method consists of questionnaires, screen recording videos and group interviews, and the framework of data processing is based on the theory of the mechanics of collaboration. In the four steps of the development of the method, empirical studies under laboratory conditions and real working conditions, and then, for validation purposes, analytical, heuristic evaluation with the involvement of usability experts were performed. During the development and the application of the method, the communication patterns of different teams were examined in terms of their relationship to software usability. In this paper we present the results of the second laboratory study and the heuristic evaluation in details. Overall, the method is able to explore team usability problems of different types of teams, making it a valuable element in existing methods for evaluating the usability of groupware.},

  abstract  = {Terrestrial vegetation is a crucial component of the Earth system, and its changes not only represent one of the most distinct aspects of climate change but also exert significant feedback within the climate system by exchanging energy, moisture, and carbon dioxide. To quantitatively and mechanistically study climate-vegetation feedback, numerical vegetation models have been developed on the theory of ecophysiological constraints on plant functional types. The models eventually can simulate vegetation distribution and succession across different spatial and temporal scales, and associated terrestrial carbon cycle processes by categorizing vegetation into biomes according different plant functional types and their associated environmental factors. Here we review the developing history of vegetation models and provide recent advances and future directions. Before 21st century, static vegetation models, as developed statistical models, can only simulate equilibrated characteristics of vegetation distribution. In last several decades, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) have been developed to simulate instantaneous responses of vegetation to climate change and associated dynamics, and can be coupled with Earth system models to investigate interactions among atmosphere, ocean, and land. DGVMs are also widely applied to investigate the dynamics accounting for changes in the geographic distribution patterns of land surface vegetation at different spatial and temporal scales and to assess the impacts of terrestrial carbon and water fluxes and land use changes. We suggest that future vegetation modeling could integrate with machine learning, and explore vegetation transient response and feedback as well as impacts of process hierarchies and human activities on climate and ecosystem.},

Prolonged low-flow periods, attributed to shifting climatic conditions, swiftly reduce the available water storage in reservoirs and threaten the quality of river water. This paper introduces a framework for assessing the environmental dynamic resilience (EDR) of urban water systems. The EDR framework stands as a state-of-the-art risk assessment tool that incorporates the dynamic nature and recovery time of water systems. The framework employs outputs from a series of models, including climate, hydrological, and urban water system models, as input data. To validate the findings from the proposed framework, environmental reliability (ER) is utilized as a conventional risk metric in the realm of water resource management. London, UK, serves as a case area to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed climate-related risk metric. The findings suggest a projected 10.5},

The meanings of things have primarily been probed using behavioral production norms and corpus-derived statistical methods. However, it is not known to what extent the collection method and the language being probed influence the resulting semantic feature vectors. In this study, we compare behavioral with corpus-based norms, across Finnish and English, using an all-to-all approach. To complete the set of norms required for this study, we present a new set of Finnish behavioral production norms, containing both abstract and concrete concepts. We found that all the norms provide largely similar information about the relationships of concrete objects and allow item-level mapping across norms sets. This validates the use of the corpus-derived norms which are easier to obtain than behavioral norms, which are labor-intensive to collect, for studies that do not depend on subtle differences in meaning between close semantic neighbors.},

  abstract  = {The interpretation of feature importance in machine learning models is challenging when features are dependent. Permutation feature importance (PFI) ignores such dependencies, which can cause misleading interpretations due to extrapolation. A possible remedy is more advanced conditional PFI approaches that enable the assessment of feature importance conditional on all other features. Due to this shift in perspective and in order to enable correct interpretations, it is beneficial if the conditioning is transparent and comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a new sampling mechanism for the conditional distribution based on permutations in conditional subgroups. As these subgroups are constructed using tree-based methods such as transformation trees, the conditioning becomes inherently interpretable. This not only provides a simple and effective estimator of conditional PFI, but also local PFI estimates within the subgroups. In addition, we apply the conditional subgroups approach to partial dependence plots, a popular method for describing feature effects that can also suffer from extrapolation when features are dependent and interactions are present in the model. In simulations and a real-world application, we demonstrate the advantages of the conditional subgroup approach over existing methods: It allows to compute conditional PFI that is more true to the data than existing proposals and enables a fine-grained interpretation of feature effects and importance within the conditional subgroups.},

This study reviews the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in CE to introduce a potential framework for a comprehensive environmental assessment and circularity quantification of circular product systems and to contribute to the agenda of ISO/TC 323, CE. The study is conducted in two steps. In the first step, the methodological approaches of LCA and CE are defined and the conceptual relationship between them is also explained. In the second step, the potentialities, and limitations of the application of LCA in CE have been identified. A diverse interpretation of the CE concept is identified as one of the main limitations that obstruct transforming the product systems from linear to circular and makes the application of LCA in CE challenging. A framework has been introduced by adapting the standardized LCA methodology regarding the requirements of CE design strategies and integrating it with the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI). The proposed framework can aid in transforming linear product systems into circular ones and investigate whether an increase in circularity improves or impairs the environmental performance of the targeted circular product systems. However, a careful assessment is required from the LCA experts and practitioners to establish links amongst all phases in an LCA study while incorporating CE design strategies into a product/service life cycle.},

  abstract  = {In the realm of speaker identification, pitch frequency serves as a fundamental feature. However, this feature can be compromised when a speaker records his speech in a closed room, resulting in distorted signal features. This distortion not only reduces the effectiveness of speaker identification systems, but also opens the door for potential deception by hackers who exploit the reverberation effects in closed rooms. To address this concern, the correction of estimated pitch frequencies emerges as an essential step for the success of speaker identification systems. This paper presents a Hybrid Approach for Estimating Pitch Frequency (HAEPF) that integrates both the Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) and Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) methods. Furthermore, the paper delves into the modeling of reverberant speech using comb filtering, shedding light on how multiple reflections impact the accuracy of pitch frequency estimation. Several simulation experiments were conducted to assess pitch frequency estimation for speech signals, both in the presence and absence of reverberation. The estimation errors were calculated for all three scenarios of reverberation (mild, moderate, and severe). The results clearly indicate that as the degree of reverberation, characterized by the comb filter order, increases, the pitch frequency estimation error also increases. The estimation accuracy of the proposed approach is calculated in terms of Pitch Frequency Estimation Error (PFEE), Gross Pitch Error (GPE) and Octave Error (OER) and is compared with those of several established pitch frequency estimation methods. The proposed approach exhibits a notable enhancement even in noisy environments, reducing PFEE by 43},

  abstract  = {Since the first autochthonous transmission of West Nile Virus was detected in Germany (WNV) in 2018, it has become endemic in several parts of the country and is continuing to spread due to the attainment of a suitable environment for vector occurrence and pathogen transmission. Increasing temperature associated with a changing climate has been identified as a potential driver of mosquito-borne disease in temperate regions. This scenario justifies the need for the development of a spatially and temporarily explicit model that describes the dynamics of WNV transmission in Germany. In this study, we developed a process-based mechanistic epidemic model driven by environmental and epidemiological data. Functional traits of mosquitoes and birds of interest were used to parameterize our compartmental model appropriately. Air temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity were the key climatic forcings used to replicate the fundamental niche responsible for supporting mosquito population and infection transmission risks in the study area. An inverse calibration method was used to optimize our parameter selection. Our model was able to generate spatially and temporally explicit basic reproductive number (R_0) maps showing dynamics of the WNV occurrences across Germany, which was strongly associated with the deviation from daily means of climatic forcings, signaling the impact of a changing climate in vector-borne disease dynamics. Epidemiological data for human infections sourced from Robert Koch Institute and animal cases collected from the Animal Diseases Information System (TSIS) of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute were used to validate model-simulated transmission rates. From our results, it was evident that West Nile Virus is likely to spread towards the western parts of Germany with the rapid attainment of environmental suitability for vector mosquitoes and amplifying host birds, especially short-distance migratory birds. Locations with high risk of WNV outbreak (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony) were shown on R_0 maps. This study presents a path for developing an early warning system for vector-borne diseases driven by climate change.},

Firstly, a linear motion channel matching the size of the ants’ legs was designed, and the movements of ants with different leg injuries were captured using high-speed cameras, constructing a comprehensive video dataset of ants’ movements with missing legs. Secondly, stable and reliable motion position information for keypoints on the ants’ bodies and legs was obtained by utilizing low-annotation biometric keypoint detection technology. Finally, by analyzing the filtered gait data, information about the changes in the step locational points areas, phase differences, and duty factors of the injured ants’ remaining legs was obtained. Comparative analysis of the ants’ gait characteristics revealed some common adjustment patterns when the ants were in the injured states. Additionally, the study found that the loss of a foreleg had a significant impact on the ants’ movement. When two legs were missing, the loss of both legs on the same side had a greater effect on movement, whereas symmetric opposite-side leg loss conditions had a lesser impact. The research will provide an important reference for the subsequent design of gait adjustment algorithms for biomimetic multi-legged robots under damaged conditions.},

Using a combination of methods including entropy weight technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, geospatial analysis, and optimal parameter geodetector, this study investigates the patterns and mechanisms of China’s TONED in the prefecture-level cities from 2011 to 2020. The findings reveal that (1) the TONED exhibited a spatial distribution characterized by higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west, along with a pyramidal hierarchy of levels. The distribution of hot and cold spots roughly followed the Heihe-Yulin line. (2) The informatization levels, openness to the outside world, and urbanization played a dominant role in the TONED. The types of dual-factor interactions exhibited both dual-factor enhancement and non-linear enhancement effects. (3) The eastern and central regions were more likely to promote the TONED through enhanced informatization levels, whereas the western region relied more on increasing openness. This study finds that the TONED results from the combined effects of three geographical natures, each playing a distinct role. The recommendations provided can serve as a reference for China and other developing countries to implement the TONED in the context of deglobalization.},

  abstract  = {Climatic conditions are key determining factors of whether plant pests flourish. Models of pest response to temperature are integral to pest risk assessment and management, helping to inform surveillance and control measures. The widespread use of meteorological data as predictors in these models compromises their reliability as these measurements are not thermally coupled to the conditions experienced by pest organisms or their body temperatures. Here, we present how mechanistic microclimate models can be used to estimate the conditions experienced by pest organisms to provide significant benefits to pest risk modelling. These well-established physical models capture how landscape, vegetation and climate interact to determine the conditions to which pests are exposed. Assessments of pest risk derived from microclimate conditions are likely to significantly diverge from those derived from weather station measurements. The magnitude of this divergence will vary across a landscape, over time and according to pest habitats and behaviour due to the complex mechanisms that determine microclimate conditions and their effect on pest biology. Whereas the application of microclimate models was once restricted to relatively homogeneous habitats, these models can now be applied readily to generate hourly time series across extensive and varied landscapes. We outline the benefits and challenges of more routine application of microclimate models to pest risk modelling. Mechanistic microclimate models provide a heuristic tool that helps discriminate between physical, mathematical and biological causes of model failure. Their use can also help understand how pest ecology, behaviour and physiology mediate the relationship between climate and pest response.},

  abstract  = {This seminal study explores systemic sustainability within the Industry 5.0 paradigm, using the strategic lens of geoanthropology to shape the emerging concept of Industry 6.0. A transdisciplinary approach is adopted, integrating geoanthropological insights into the analysis of the Italian ceramic district. Seven key factors are considered: resource consumption, production dynamics, innovation, environmental impact, social impact, market dynamics, and economic impact. Historical events such as changes in Italian industrial policy, market slowdowns, and the COVID-19 pandemic are identified as significant for the sector. A contingent analysis tailored to the unique characteristics of the ceramic district provides an in-depth understanding of its challenges and opportunities. The incorporation of geoanthropology provides a transdisciplinary perspective that allows for an in-depth examination of the complex interactions between people and their environment in an industrial setting. The study highlights the central role of innovation, digitalization, and government policies in driving positive changes in production efficiency, market dynamics, and economic impact. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the delicate balance between environmental sustainability and resource consumption, as well as the effective management of the social impacts of digitization. To address these challenges, a systemic sustainability index derived from geoanthropological insights is proposed as a pragmatic tool to measure and guide the development of sustainability initiatives in the ceramic district. The results of this study not only pave the way for new horizons in sustainability assessment but also provide valuable insights for industrial district managers to formulate strategies that foster organizational flexibility and resilience.},

  abstract  = {With the continuous promotion of China’s education informatization reform, classroom construction is gradually moving towards the direction of intelligence and personalization. In the era of Internet plus, the smart classroom model with talent training as the core and computer technology as the driving force has gradually improved. But currently, the evaluation of offline classrooms in smart classrooms relies too heavily on subjective evaluation, making it difficult to fully quantify classroom effectiveness. Therefore, the research aims to improve the teaching effectiveness of classrooms through real-time monitoring and intelligent device regulation, and carefully and accurately quantify evaluations. The research adopts improved background frame difference object detection algorithm and object tracking algorithm for moving object detection and tracking. Meanwhile, a real-time facial recognition method based on visual tracking has achieved student micro-expression recognition and focus assessment. The focus evaluation method is based on the three-dimensional learning state space and emotional dimension theory. Building a smart classroom system on this basis, which includes a monitoring system, recording and tracking positioning system, and evaluation system. This system can achieve teaching monitoring for students, recording and saving, and tracking, positioning, and quantitative evaluation of teaching students. These results confirm that the accuracy of the system is maintained at 96},

  abstract  = {The Tibetan Plateau, often referred to as Asia’s water tower, is a focal point for studying spatiotemporal changes in water resources amidst global warming. Precipitation is a crucial water resource for the Tibetan Plateau. Precipitation information holds significant importance in supporting research on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we estimate the performance and applicability of Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation products for estimating precipitation and different disaster scenarios (including extreme precipitation, drought, and snow) across the Tibetan Plateau. Extreme precipitation and drought indexes are employed to describe extreme precipitation and drought conditions. We evaluated the performance of various precipitation products using daily precipitation time series from 2000 to 2014. Statistical metrics were used to estimate and compare the performances of different precipitation products. The results indicate that (1) Both CMAP and IMERG showed higher fitting degrees with gauge precipitation observations in daily precipitation. Probability of detection, False Alarm Ratio, and Critical Success Index values of CMAP and IMERG were approximately 0.42 to 0.72, 0.38 to 0.56, and 0.30 to 0.42, respectively. Different precipitation products presented higher daily average precipitation amount and frequency in southeastern Tibetan Plateau. (2) CMAP and GPCP precipitation products showed relatively great and poor performance, respectively, in predicting daily and monthly precipitation on the plateau. False alarms might have a notable impact on the accuracy of precipitation products. (3) Extreme precipitation amount could be better predicted by precipitation products. Extreme precipitation day could be badly predicted by precipitation products. Different precipitation products showed that the bias of drought estimation increased as the time scale increased. (4) GLDAS series products might have relatively better performance in simulating (main range of RMSE: 2.0–4.5) snowfall than rainfall and sleet in plateau. G-Noah demonstrated slightly better performance in simulating snowfall (main range of RMSE: 1.0–2.1) than rainfall (main range of RMSE: 2.0–3.8) and sleet (main range of RMSE: 1.5–3.8). This study’s findings contribute to understanding the performance variations among different precipitation products and identifying potential factors contributing to biases within these products. Additionally, the study sheds light on disaster characteristics and warning systems specific to the Tibetan Plateau.},

  abstract  = {A ventromedial cortical ‘Where’ visual pathway in humans for spatial scenes is revealed with MEG. It is fundamental to episodic memory and navigation. The primate including the human hippocampus implicated in episodic memory and navigation represents a spatial view, very different from the place representations in rodents. To understand this system in humans, and the computations performed, the pathway for this spatial view information to reach the hippocampus was analysed in humans. Whole-brain effective connectivity was measured with magnetoencephalography between 30 visual cortical regions and 150 other cortical regions using the HCP-MMP1 atlas in 21 participants while performing a 0-back scene memory task. In a ventromedial visual stream, V1–V4 connect to the ProStriate region where the retrosplenial scene area is located. The ProStriate region has connectivity to ventromedial visual regions VMV1–3 and VVC. These ventromedial regions connect to the medial parahippocampal region PHA1–3, which, with the VMV regions, include the parahippocampal scene area. The medial parahippocampal regions have effective connectivity to the entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and hippocampus. In contrast, when viewing faces, the effective connectivity was more through a ventrolateral visual cortical stream via the fusiform face cortex to the inferior temporal visual cortex regions TE2p and TE2a. A ventromedial visual cortical ‘Where’ stream to the hippocampus for spatial scenes was supported by diffusion topography in 171 HCP participants at 7 T.},

  abstract  = {The collaboration among autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and/or unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), significantly enhances their capabilities by enabling them to tackle more complex tasks exceeding those of individual robots. However, to fully exploit this collaboration, a common understanding of exchanged information—referred to as semantic interoperability—is crucial. Achieving semantic interoperability between these robots requires a deep understanding of relevant information and its underlying structure. To address this challenge, this paper presents a platform- and technology-independent information model developed specifically for AMRs. This model aims to facilitate collaboration by structuring information in a way that ensures semantic interoperability. The paper outlines the model's development process, beginning with a structured consolidation of information from pertinent scientific literature, resulting in a foundational framework for representing knowledge and semantics within the domain of AMRs. The practical application of the information model is demonstrated through a use case involving multiple AMRs. Additionally, the paper provides insights into the employed methodology, emphasizing the significance of systematic literature reviews and collaboration with practitioners to refine and validate the model. It also discusses theoretical and practical implications, addressing potential limitations encountered during the research.},

  abstract  = {Jamming in amorphous systems is an athermal transition characterized by mixed first-order and second-order aspects. Authors demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder, revealing significant finite-size effects and a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities in cyclically sheared systems. Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations, in two and three dimensions. Based on scaling analyses, we show that fluctuations of the jamming density in finite-sized systems have important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of the first-order transition with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems where sample-to-sample fluctuations dominate over thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the nature and behavior of the jamming transition might be better understood within the developed theoretical framework of the athermally driven random-field Ising model.},

  abstract  = {We present a general framework for incorporating partial differential equation (PDE)-based models into gradient-based optimization of multidisciplinary systems by integrating FEniCSx with the recently developed Computational System Design Language ( CSDL ). CSDL is a domain-specific language designed to facilitate adjoint sensitivity analysis multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). We use CSDL’s abstractions to link together sub-models representing different disciplines, not all of which are necessarily modeled by PDEs. For the subsystems which are modeled by PDEs, we use FEniCSx to compute partial derivatives of problem residuals, which CSDL can combine with derivatives from other disciplines using the chain rule and the adjoint method. The development of this framework is motivated by the problem of optimizing designs of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft where, due to the relative novelty of this class of vehicle, there is currently a large, unexplored design space. Predicting the performance of eVTOL aircraft requires PDE-based modeling of various sub-problems, including electric motors, composite shell structures, and thermoelasticity and electrochemistry of battery packs. For system-level analysis and optimization, these must be coupled to non-PDE components, such as low-fidelity aerodynamic models, geometric design tools, and lumped-parameter battery and circuit models. In this work, we demonstrate the modeling flexibility and efficiency of this framework through classic optimal control and topology optimization problems with known solutions, and also challenging eVTOL-related applications including shape optimization of an electric motor, and aeroelastic coupling for gust response of an eVTOL wing. Given the generality of this framework, we expect it to facilitate research on a wide range of PDE-constrained MDO problems beyond eVTOL applications.},

  abstract  = {A learnable DSP (LDSP) is introduced as a new benchmark for linear compensation in optical communications, which optimizes DSP blocks globally by leveraging the power of learnable perspectivity. The surge in interest regarding the next generation of optical fiber transmission has stimulated the development of digital signal processing (DSP) schemes that are highly cost-effective with both high performance and low complexity. As benchmarks for nonlinear compensation methods, however, traditional DSP designed with block-by-block modules for linear compensations, could exhibit residual linear effects after compensation, limiting the nonlinear compensation performance. Here we propose a high-efficient design thought for DSP based on the learnable perspectivity, called learnable DSP (LDSP). LDSP reuses the traditional DSP modules, regarding the whole DSP as a deep learning framework and optimizing the DSP parameters adaptively based on backpropagation algorithm from a global scale. This method not only establishes new standards in linear DSP performance but also serves as a critical benchmark for nonlinear DSP designs. In comparison to traditional DSP with hyperparameter optimization, a notable enhancement of approximately 1.21 dB in the Q factor for 400 Gb/s signal after 1600 km fiber transmission is experimentally demonstrated by combining LDSP and perturbation-based nonlinear compensation algorithm. Benefiting from the learnable model, LDSP can learn the best configuration adaptively with low complexity, reducing dependence on initial parameters. The proposed approach implements a symbol-rate DSP with a small bit error rate (BER) cost in exchange for a 48},

  abstract  = {Context: Empirical studies with human participants (e.g., controlled experiments) are established methods in Software Engineering (SE) research to understand developers’ activities or the pros and cons of a technique, tool, or practice. Various guidelines and recommendations on designing and conducting different types of empirical studies in SE exist. However, the use of financial incentives (i.e., paying participants to compensate for their effort and improve the validity of a study) is rarely mentioned Objective: In this article, we analyze and discuss the use of financial incentives for human-oriented SE experimentation to derive corresponding guidelines and recommendations for researchers. Specifically, we propose how to extend the current state-of-the-art and provide a better understanding of when and how to incentivize. Method: We captured the state-of-the-art in SE by performing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) involving 105 publications from six conferences and five journals published in 2020 and 2021. Then, we conducted an interdisciplinary analysis based on guidelines from experimental economics and behavioral psychology, two disciplines that research and use financial incentives. Results: Our results show that financial incentives are sparsely used in SE experimentation, mostly as completion fees. Especially performance-based and task-related financial incentives (i.e., payoff functions) are not used, even though we identified studies for which the validity may benefit from tailored payoff functions. To tackle this issue, we contribute an overview of how experiments in SE may benefit from financial incentivisation, a guideline for deciding on their use, and 11 recommendations on how to design them. Conclusions: We hope that our contributions get incorporated into standards (e.g., the ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards), helping researchers understand whether the use of financial incentives is useful for their experiments and how to define a suitable incentivisation strategy.},

  abstract  = {The Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) family is well-known to comprise three classes of intracellular enzymes. Class I PI3Ks primarily function in signaling by responding to cell surface receptor stimulation, while class II and III are more involved in membrane transport. Under normal physiological conditions, the PI3K signaling network orchestrates cell growth, division, migration and survival. Aberrant activation of the PI3K signaling pathway disrupts cellular activity and metabolism, often marking the onset of cancer. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the clinical use of five class I PI3K inhibitors. These small-molecule inhibitors, which exhibit varying selectivity for different class I PI3K family members, are primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer and hematologic malignancies. Therefore, the development of novel class I PI3K inhibitors has been a prominent research focus in the field of oncology, aiming to enhance potential therapeutic selectivity and effectiveness. In this review, we summarize the specific structures of PI3Ks and their functional roles in cancer progression. Additionally, we critically evaluate small molecule inhibitors that target class I PI3K, with a particular focus on their clinical applications in cancer treatment. Moreover, we aim to analyze therapeutic approaches for different types of cancers marked by aberrant PI3K activation and to identify potential molecular targets amenable to intervention with small-molecule inhibitors. Ultimately, we propose future directions for the development of therapeutic strategies that optimize cancer treatment outcomes by modulating the PI3K family.},

  abstract  = {The coupled nonnegative matrix factorization method can utilize the information in high-resolution images to assist in the extraction of local semantic features of low-resolution (LR) images. However, since the supervised information is not fully considered in the existing methods, the discriminative performance of the extracted features is limited. In this paper, k -homogeneous nearest neighbor-driven discriminant graph coupled nonnegative matrix factorization (KHNNDG-CNMF) is proposed for low-resolution image recognition (LRIR). In the proposed approach, a k -homogeneous nearest neighbor-driven discriminant graph (KHNNDG) is constructed, which is a discriminant graph matrix constructed within the geometrical nearest neighbors of k homogeneous samples. In discriminant graph construction methods, the two problems of insufficient utilization of data information in local neighborhoods existing in the previous neighbor graph and the inability to reflect the real data distribution in the local neighborhood can be improved. According to the geometrical spatial distribution of samples, the KHNNDG can adaptively reflect the relationship between intra-class samples and inter-class samples, and relatively few hyperparameters are required. Therefore, the coupled nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm combined with the KHNNDG embedding regularized term can more accurately and effectively utilize the local discriminativeness of the original space to constrain the coupled features. Furthermore, we further strengthen the class separability among features by incorporating a consistent projection constraint from features to labels. The proposed algorithm performs experiments on 6 image databases. Three different LR images are involved in the experiment. Compared to the best-performing comparative method, the proposed method shows an average improvement of approximately 2.36},

  abstract  = {Context Code smells (CS) are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices that may lead to increased defect incidence, decreased code comprehension, and longer times to release. Web applications and systems are seldom studied, probably due to the heterogeneity of platforms (server and client-side) and languages, and to study web code smells, we need to consider CS covering that diversity. Furthermore, the literature provides little evidence for the claim that CS are a symptom of poor design, leading to future problems in web apps. Objective To study the quantitative evolution and inner relationship of CS in web apps on the server- and client-sides, and their impact on maintainability and app time-to-release (TTR). Method We collected and analyzed 18 server-side, and 12 client-side code smells, aka web smells, from consecutive official releases of 12 PHP typical web apps, i.e., with server- and client-code in the same code base, summing 811 releases. Additionally, we collected metrics, maintenance issues, reported bugs, and release dates. We used several methodologies to devise causality relationships among the considered irregular time series, such as Granger-causality and Information Transfer Entropy(TE) with CS from previous one to four releases (lag 1 to 4). Results The CS typically evolve the same way inside their group and its possible to analyze them as groups. The CS group trends are: Server, slowly decreasing; Client-side embed, decreasing and JavaScript,increasing. Studying the relationship between CS groups we found that the "lack of code quality", measured with CS density proxies, propagates from client code to server code and JavaScript in half of the applications. We found causality relationships between CS and issues. We also found causality from CS groups to bugs in Lag 1, decreasing in the subsequent lags. The values are 15},

As software development often is a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility, enterprise agility and software adaptability become increasingly intertwined. As a consequence, decisions that regard flexibility should not be left to software developers alone. By taking a Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) approach, starting from DEMO ontological enterprise models and explicit (enterprise) implementation design decisions, the aim of this research is to bridge the gap from enterprise agility to software adaptability, in such a way that software development is no longer a limiting factor in achieving enterprise agility. Low-code technology is a growing market trend that builds on MDSD concepts and claims to offer a high degree of software adaptability. Therefore, as a first step to show the potential benefits to use DEMO ontological enterprise models as a base for MDSD, this research shows the design of a mapping from DEMO models to Mendix for the (automated) creation of a low-code application that also intrinsically accommodates run-time implementation design decisions.},

  abstract  = {Modeling is often associated with complex and heavy tooling, leading to a negative perception among practitioners. However, alternative paradigms, such as everything-as-code or low-code, are gaining acceptance due to their perceived ease of use. This paper explores the dichotomy between these perceptions through the lens of “modeler experience” (MX). MX includes factors such as user experience, motivation, integration, collaboration and versioning, and language complexity. We examine the relationships between these factors and their impact on different modeling usage scenarios. Our findings highlight the importance of considering MX when understanding how developers interact with modeling tools and the complexities of modeling and associated tooling.},

  abstract  = {When creating a software model, it is necessary that it accurately captures the desired behaviour, while at the same time ensuring that any undesired behaviour is excluded. On the one hand, formal verification tools can be used to check the internal consistency of a software system, ensuring that the behaviour of one software component does not contradict another. On the other hand, software testing is essential to check the external validity of the model more comprehensively. Unfortunately, software testing is often overlooked in curricula, resulting in graduates with inadequate software testing skills for industry. Software testing tools such as TesCaV can be used to help teachers teach software testing topics in a non-intrusive and less time-consuming way. Previous research has shown that TesCaV is easy to use and that novice users produce better quality software tests when using TesCaV. However, it has remained unclear whether learners retain the skills they gain from using TesCaV even when the tool is not offered for help. In order to understand the positive effect of TesCaV on learners’ software testing skills, this study conducted an experiment with 45 participants. The experiment used a pretest-treatment-posttest design. The results show that participants feel equally confident about the completeness of their test coverage, even though they identify more test cases. It is concluded that for course design, a capsule such as TesCaV can help students to understand the full complexity of software testing and help them to be more systematic in their approach.},

To address this issue, swCUDA , an auto parallel code translation framework is proposed. To that end, we create scale affine translation to transform CUDA thread hierarchy to Sunway index, directive based memory hierarchy and data redirection optimization to assign optimal memory usage and data stride strategy, directive based grouping-calculation-asynchronous-reduction (GCAR) algorithm to provide general solution for random access issue. swCUDA utilizes code generator ANTLR as compiler frontend to parse CUDA kernel and integrate novel algorithms in the node of abstracted syntax tree (AST) depending on directives. Automatically translation is performed on the entire Polybench suite and NBody simulation benchmark. We get an average 40x speedup compared with baseline on the Sunway architecture, average speedup of 15x compared to x86 CPU and average 27 percentage higher than NVIDIA GPU. Further, swCUDA is implemented to translate major kernels of the real world application Gromacs. The translated version achieves up to 17x speedup.},

  abstract  = {Small infrared targets in complex backgrounds are easily obscured by a large amount of clutter, so highly discriminative features are needed to distinguish them from the cluttered background. Even if the expansion factor is increased, methods based on semantic segmentation are still difficult to aggregate local features of obscure and small objects. Even by increasing the dilation factor, methods based on semantic segmentation still have difficulty in aggregating local features of obscure and small objects. In order to effectively separate targets from their background environments and extract information of small targets with complex backgrounds, this paper proposes the attention-based context-aware network (ACANet) model. Context-aware feature aggregation model adopts dilated convolutions to extract high-level features, yet mitigates potential harm to small targets by clustering local features and reducing the dilation factor. Subsequently, abstract and detailed information are effectively fused through a cross-layer feature fusion model based on cross-layer attention and asymmetric feature fusion methods. In addition, the global pixel perception module is also used to assist in capturing target position information, which can alleviate the precise positioning challenge of the model due to the small size of the target. Experimental results show that compared with other state-of-the-art methods on existing public datasets, ACANet exhibits superior performance in metrics such as detection probability, false alarm rate, and mIoU.},

  abstract  = {This study addresses the challenge of obtaining detailed wind speed data in complex terrains by employing dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques. The research utilizes diagnostic and prognostic dynamic models, along with the Decaying Average (DA) and Analog Ensemble (AE) methods, starting from ERA5 global reanalysis. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and California Meteorological (CALMET) models are evaluated for their performance in simulating 10 m wind speed in the Zhangjiakou competition zone during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The study compares the accuracy of various downscaling approaches for wind speed estimation. High-density observational data from 12 stations, covering an area of about 20 km² and collected between October and April from 2017 to 2022, were employed for model calibration and validation. The research reveals that the planetary boundary layer scheme and land surface scheme significantly impact the WRF model’s wind speed simulation. Meanwhile, the slope flow parameter emerges as a key sensitivity factor for the CALMET model. Despite inheriting biases from ERA5 and WRF, the CALMET model, driven by ERA5 and WRF at a 100 m resolution, offers a reasonable spatial distribution of wind speed which was required by the ski competition. Both the DA and AE methods prove effective in correcting biases in 10 m wind speed from the ERA5, WRF, and CALMET models, with the AE method generally outperforming the DA method. The AE method reduces the root mean square error of the CALMET model’s 10 m wind speed from 3.1 m/s to 1.5 m/s at locations with stations. In conclusion, the study identifies the combination of the CALMET model and the AE bias-corrected method as the optimal dynamic-statistical downscaling scheme for 10 m wind speed in the study area.},

  abstract  = {Single-frame infrared small target detection is affected by the low image resolution and small target size, and is prone to the problems of small target feature loss and positional offset during continuous downsampling; at the same time, the sparse features of the small targets do not correlate well with the global-local linkage of the background features. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an efficient infrared small target detection method. First, this paper incorporates BlurPool in the feature extraction part, which reduces the loss and positional offset of small target features in the process of convolution and pooling. Second, this paper designs an interactive attention deep feature fusion module, which acquires the correlation information between the target and the background from a global perspective, and designs a compression mechanism based on deep a priori knowledge, which reduces the computational difficulty of the self-attention mechanism. Then, this paper designs the context local feature enhancement and fusion module, which uses deep semantic features to dynamically guide shallow local features to realize enhancement and fusion. Finally, this paper proposes an edge feature extraction module for shallow features, which utilizes the complete texture and location information in the shallow features to assist the network to initially locate the target position and edge shape. Numerous experiments show that the method in this paper significantly improves nIoU, F1-Measure and AUC on IRSTD-1k Datasets and NUAA-SIRST Datasets.},

  abstract  = {Conceptual modeling plays a central role in planning, designing, developing and maintaining software-intensive systems. One of the goals of conceptual modeling is to enable clear communication among stakeholders involved in said activities. To achieve effective communication, conceptual models must be understood by different people in the same way. To support such shared understanding, conceptual modeling languages are defined, which introduce rules and constraints on how individual models can be built and how they are to be understood. A key component of a modeling language is an ontology, i.e., a set of concepts that modelers must use to describe world phenomena. Once the concepts are chosen, a visual and/or textual vocabulary is adopted for representing the concepts. However, the choices both of the concepts and of the vocabulary used to represent them may affect the quality of the language under consideration: some choices may promote shared understanding better than other choices. To allow evaluation and comparison of alternative choices, we present Peira, a framework for empirically measuring the domain and comprehensibility appropriateness of conceptual modeling language ontologies. Given a language ontology to be evaluated, the framework is based on observing how prospective language users classify domain content under the concepts put forth by said ontology. A set of metrics is then used to analyze the observations and identify and characterize possible issues that the choice of concepts or the way they are represented may have. The metrics are abstract in that they can be operationalized into concrete implementations tailored to specific data collection instruments or study objectives. We evaluate the framework by applying it to compare an existing language against an artificial one that is manufactured to exhibit specific issues. We then test if the metrics indeed detect these issues. We find that the framework does offer the expected indications, but that it also requires good understanding of the metrics prior to committing to interpretations of the observations.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates the impact of enhanced horizontal resolution on simulating mean and extreme precipitation in the major river basins of southern Africa. Seven global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) are used, which are available at both high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR). The models are assessed using three observational datasets from 1983–2014 during December-January–February. The performance of the models in simulating nine extreme precipitation indices, as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), is quantitatively assessed using various of statistical metrics. Results show that the distributions of daily precipitation from the HR models are nearly identical to those of their LR counterparts. However, model biases are not consistent across the three observations. Most HR and LR models reasonably simulate mean precipitation, maximum consecutive dry and wet days (CDD and CWD), number of rainy days (RR1) and heavy precipitation events (R10mm and R20mm), albeit with some biases. Enhanced horizontal resolution improves the simulation of mean precipitation, CDD, CWD, RR1 and R10mm, as indicated by high spatial correlation coefficients (SCCs), low root mean square errors (RMSEs), and reduced biases in most HR models. The majority of the HighResMIP models (i.e., both LR and HR models) overestimates extreme wet days precipitation (R95p and R99p), maximum one-day precipitation (Rx1day), and simple daily intensity (SDII), with a pronounced wet bias in HR models for R95p and R99p. Most LR models outperforms HR models in simulating R95p, R99p, and SDII. By means of a Comprehensive Ranking Metrics, EC-EARTH_HR is identified as the best performing model for simulating all nine extreme precipitation indices across the basins, except for the Zambezi, where EC-EARTH_LR performs best. Our findings indicate that increased resolution can either improve or worsen performance depending on the model and basin. Therefore, no clear evidence exist that enhanced horizontal resolution under HighResMIP enhances the simulation of extreme precipitation in southern Africa.},

This paper presents a probabilistic analysis of horizontal strip anchors in spatially varying soil using the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) as a prediction model. The use of MARS in spatially varying soils is proposed, and its advantage over the conventional expensive Monte Carlo simulations is reported in this paper. The soil cohesion and friction angle have been modeled as lognormal random fields, and the influence of the spatially distributed soil properties on the anchor uplift capacity is assessed in the current study. Furthermore, a comparison between the deterministic and reliability-based design methodologies is presented, and their implications on the design of foundation are discussed. The results indicate that the code-specified factor of safety (FOS) value of 1.5 does not fulfill the target probability of failure (

  abstract  = {The nature of modern organizations needs to be increasingly adaptive, since they are dealing with a constant demand to respond to stimuli derived from the dynamic environments they operate in. Changing their capabilities is a common response, and this makes capability management a vital aspect of organizational survivability. To date, there are no approaches specifically designed to address this specific situation. KYKLOS and Compass are two interlinked approaches of different complexity, a DSML and a canvas, developed to support capability change. As recently developed methods, they lacked formal demonstration and evaluation; therefore, the goal of this article is to present the demonstration and evaluation of the two approaches by their stakeholders, in particular, business and modeling experts. A case study in a Swedish company in the ERP system consulting domain that is undergoing changes in its sales and consulting capabilities related to evolving customer requirements has been used to demonstrate and evaluate the two approaches. The process consisted of two evaluation cycles. The first cycle concerned KYKLOS and used two categories of evaluators, the business experts and the modeling experts. While the modeling experts evaluated positively the method, the business experts had difficulties associated with its ease of use and adoption. This resulted in the development of Compass, which was evaluated by business experts during the second evaluation cycle. Compass was evaluated more positively in terms of the difficult aspects, but the challenge is ongoing and motivates further future research.},

Then, the uniaxial compression of ceramics with different crack lengths and inclination angles are simulated. The crack initiation and propagation processes are illustrated with displacement and stress fields. The results show the predicted crack patterns are qualitatively in agreement with experimental observations. There are two stages of crack propagation with increasing uniaxial compressive load, i.e., primary and secondary cracks. In addition, the inclination and crack length of the defects have a great influence on the mode of crack initiation and propagation, and the first crack is more likely to initiate and extend for the defects with larger crack length and smaller inclination angle.},

  abstract  = {Current treatments of brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) are associated with considerable risks and at times incomplete efficacy. Therefore, a clinically consistent animal model of BAVM is urgently needed to investigate its underlying biological mechanisms and develop innovative treatment strategies. Notably, existing mouse models have limited utility due to heterogenous and untypical phenotypes of AVM lesions. Here we developed a novel mouse model of sporadic BAVM that is consistent with clinical manifestations in humans. Mice with Braf ^V600E mutations in brain ECs developed BAVM closely resembled that of human lesions. This strategy successfully induced BAVMs in mice across different age groups and within various brain regions. Pathological features of BAVM were primarily dilated blood vessels with reduced vascular wall stability, accompanied by spontaneous hemorrhage and neuroinflammation. Single-cell sequencing revealed differentially expressed genes that were related to the cytoskeleton, cell motility, and intercellular junctions. Early administration of Dabrafenib was found to be effective in slowing the progression of BAVMs; however, its efficacy in treating established BAVM lesions remained uncertain. Taken together, our proposed approach successfully induced BAVM that closely resembled human BAVM lesions in mice, rendering the model suitable for investigating the pathogenesis of BAVM and assessing potential therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract  = {Enterprise Risk Management involves the process of identification, evaluation, treatment, and communication regarding risks throughout the enterprise. To support the tasks associated with this process, several frameworks and modeling languages have been proposed, such as the Risk and Security Overlay (RSO) of ArchiMate. An ontological investigation of this artifact would reveal its adequacy, capabilities, and limitations w.r.t. the domain of risk and security. Based on that, a language redesign can be proposed as a refinement. Such analysis and redesign have been executed for the risk elements of the RSO grounded in the Common Ontology of Value and Risk . The next step along this line of research is to address the following research problems: What would be the outcome of an ontological analysis of security-related elements of the RSO? That is, can we identify other semantic deficiencies in the RSO through an ontological analysis? Once such an analysis is provided, can we redesign the security elements of the RSO accordingly, in order to produce an improved artifact? Here, with the aid of the Reference Ontology for Security Engineering (ROSE) and the ontological theory of prevention behind it, we address the remaining gap by proceeding with an ontological analysis of the security-related constructs of the RSO. The outcome of this assessment is an ontology-based redesign of the ArchiMate language regarding security modeling. In a nutshell, we report the following contributions: (1) an ontological analysis of the RSO that identifies six limitations concerning security modeling; (2) because of the key role of the notion of prevention in security modeling, the introduction of the ontological theory of prevention in ArchiMate; (3) a well-founded redesign of security elements of ArchiMate; and (4) ontology-based security modeling patterns that are logical consequences of our proposal of redesign due to its underlying ontology of security. As a form of evaluation, we show that our proposal can describe risk treatment options, according to ISO 31000. Finally, besides presenting multiple examples, we proceed with a real-world illustrative application taken from the cybersecurity domain.},

  abstract  = {With the increasing application of flexible pipes in deep-sea operations, higher processing accuracy is required for the individual metal layers of these pipes to withstand greater service loads. In the helical winding production of the tensile armour layer, the accuracy of tension control significantly affects the uniformity of the steel strip after winding. To ensure tensile stability during the processing of steel strips, a tensile model for the manufacturing process is proposed. This model can be used to predict the magnitude and trend of tension fluctuations caused by the unwinding device, facilitating the design of a constant tension control system for steel strips based on an integral separation fuzzy PID algorithm. This system can achieve rapid convergence of tension during large tension fluctuations. The experimental results confirm the accuracy of the prediction model and the reliability and effectiveness of the designed tension control system. With this system, the tension fluctuation range is reduced by nearly 40},

  abstract  = {This paper considers an asynchronous grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems which can be applied in massive machine-type communications (mMTCs) and underwater IoT acoustic communication scenarios due to its high spectral efficiency and low power consumption characteristics. In particular, the system’s asynchronous reception of user signals can effectively reduce the additional overhead caused by synchronous reception. We investigate the joint activity and channel estimation in the asynchronous case, where an asynchronous frame structure is considered, and a pilot sequence designed by chaotic sequence is used to reduce the pilot storage space. The joint estimations are formulated as single measurement vector (SMV) and multiple measurement vector (MMV) problems for single-antenna and multiple-antenna systems. Different from the existing estimation algorithms, where prior information is considered for estimation, an adaptive alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)is proposed for the SMV problem and a two-stage ADMM is proposed for the MMV problem. In particular, an index set is first estimated in each iteration of our proposed adaptive ADMM, and a linear ADMM is performed based on the index set. The first stage of our proposed two-stage ADMM is to estimate the delay and the activity, and then the channel state information is estimated. Further, we analyze the complexity of the two algorithms and their sensitivity to the initial values of chaotic sequences. Finally, simulation results reflecting the detection performance of the algorithms are given. Based on the simulation results, the proposed two algorithms are computationally efficient, providing superior signal recovery accuracy and user activity detection performance. More importantly, the signal delay has a relatively small impact on the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Peanut smut ( Thecaphora frezzii) is one of the most important peanut diseases in Argentinian peanut production. This monocyclic soil-borne pathogen transforms kernels into spore masses. Spore liberation from broken infected pods during the harvest process is supposed to be the main mechanism of inoculum spread, with the subsequent spread among fields increasing the soil inoculum for future peanut cropping seasons. However, we are unaware of any published study on the role of wind (in terms of speed and direction) in how far smut spores spread. Therefore, we conducted an observational study where passive spore traps were distributed at harvest around six fields placed at 100, 200, 300, and 400 m away from each field’s centroid in four cardinal directions. Three time slices were sampled: from the beginning of harvest to 90-, 180-, and 270-minutes continuously during harvest. Wind speed and direction were recorded at each trap. A generalized additive model was fitted to describe the spore spread. Modeling the dispersal shows that the spread is influenced by wind speed and the smut severely damaged pods incidence present at the harvested field. Additionally, spore size and proportion of different smut spore types were assessed (from a single unit spore to a 5-multinuclear propagule). No statistical differences were observed in the proportion of the spore types trapped. However, fewer spores were trapped at distances farther from the harvested area. This work led us to understand a fundamental component of the peanut smut cycle and epidemiology, which is to design management strategies. For example, avoiding harvest on windy days (typically >10 km h^-1) to prevent the distant spread of inoculum for subsequent seasons or predicting the risk surrounding an infected field.},

Precipitation spatial intensity distributions represented by monthly percentiles and the differences between high/low percentiles and mean precipitation are examined for the tropical domain and for seven tropical sectors with distinct climate characteristics. Variations and trends in these components are closely related to the changes in precipitation regimes including shifting, shrinking/enlarging of tropical and regional wet/dry zones and also to the changes in precipitation intensity. Increases in high percentiles and decreases in low percentiles appear over tropical land and ocean, despite intense interannual variability contributed primarily by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Positive (negative) trends in the differences between wet (dry) percentiles and mean precipitation can be seen over tropical land and ocean as well, suggesting the broadening of precipitation spatial intensity distribution. Regional results generally support this conclusion except over tropical Africa and South Asia. These observational results are also generally evident in CMIP6 historical and AMIP6 runs with regards to the signs of the changes, though with smaller magnitudes. Relative to tropical (land + ocean) mean precipitation, wet percentile trends are + 0.7, + 0.8 and + 2.5},

  abstract  = {In the past few years, sustainable development has undoubtedly become an essential perspective for museums. Museums have been committed to raising social awareness around ecological conservation and cultural diversity through various exhibitions, education and research projects, and public engagement. However, the concepts, approaches, and practises of “sustainability” differ across nations and regions, and there is a lack of sufficient quantitative research on sustainable development by and within museums. This article aims to establish an evaluation framework and evaluation approach for museum sustainability in China. Its framework is initially based on the DSR model, in which “D” delineates seven deeds of museum visitors, “S” characterizes the status of sustainable practises within museums, and “R” involves presenting sustainability strategies pertinent to Chinese museums by integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A fuzzy QFD model is then used to develop an evaluation approach for analyzing the Zhejiang Natural History Museum (ZNHM)’s sustainable development strategies, using data from surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result of this study, significant opportunities for deepening sustainable practises were identified for ZNHM, which include updating the collection system, enhancing professionalism in exhibitions and educational projects, and securing funding policies. ZNHM’s sustainability efforts prioritize enhancing social awareness, and internal reforms related to social value, governance, and professional capabilities. With these foundations in place, international cooperation among museums may be the next step towards a sustainable future.},

Moreover, we investigate 1) how TRR performs in the field, 2) what value TRR provides to Ericsson, and 3) how TRR has influenced the ways of working. [Method] We conduct a preregistered industrial case study combining interviews with TRR stakeholders, minutes from sprint planning meetings, and bug-tracking data. The data analysis includes thematic analysis, descriptive statistics, and Bayesian causal analysis. [Results] TRR is now an incorporated part of the bug assignment process. Considering the abstraction levels of the telecommunications stack, high-level modules are more positive while low-level modules experienced some drawbacks. Most importantly, some bug reports directly reach low-level modules without first having passed through fundamental root-cause analysis steps at higher levels.

  abstract  = {Understanding the variability of extinction risk and its potential drivers across different spatial extents is crucial to revealing the underlying processes of biodiversity loss and sustainability. However, in countries with high climatic and topographic heterogeneity, studies on extinction risk are often challenged by complexities associated with extent effects. Here, using 2.02 million fine-grained distribution records and a phylogeny including 27,185 species, we find that the extinction risk of flowering plants in China is spatially concentrated in southwestern China. Our analyses suggest that spatial extinction risks of flowering plants in China may be caused by multiple drivers and are extent dependent. Vegetation structure based on proportion of growth forms is likely the dominant extinction driver at the national extent, followed by climatic and evolutionary drivers. Finer extent analyses indicate that the potential dominant extinction drivers vary across zones and vegetation regions. Despite regional heterogeneity, we detect a geographical continuity potential in extinction drivers, with variation in West China dominated by vegetation structure, South China by climate, and North China by evolution. Our findings highlight that identification of potential extent-dependent drivers of extinction risk is crucial for targeted conservation practice in countries like China. Estimating extinction risk in regions with high climatic and topographic heterogeneity is challenging. Here, the authors use occurrence data and a phylogeny of 27,185 flowering plants in China, finding that potential causes of extinction are regionally complex.},

In this study, a stacking model using the MIMIC-III dataset with a two-tier feature selection approach was developed to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality in ICU patients admitted for AKI. External validation was performed using separate MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the stacking model, and features were selected using the Boruta and XGBoost feature selection methods. This study compares the performance of a stacking model using two-tier feature selection with a model using single-tier feature selection (XGBoost: 85; Boruta: 83; two-tier: 0.91).

We examined these projected changes (between 1960–2000 and 2060–2100) in the North Pacific using a local linear stochastic-deterministic model, which allowed us to quantify the effect of changes to three drivers on SST variability: ocean “memory” (the SST damping timescale), ENSO teleconnections, and stochastic noise forcing. The ocean memory declines in most areas, but lengthens in the central North Pacific. This change is primarily due to changes in air-sea feedbacks and ocean damping, with the shallowing mixed layer depth playing a secondary role. An eastward shift of the ENSO teleconnection pattern is primarily responsible for the pattern of SST variance change.},

  abstract  = {Software Product Line (SPL) is an approach derived from other engineering fields that use reuse techniques for a family of products in a given domain. An essential artifact of SPL is the Product Line Architecture (PLA), which identifies elements characterized by variation points, variability, and variants. The PLA aims to anticipate design decisions to obtain features such as reusability and modularity. Nevertheless, getting a reusable and modular PLA and following pre-defined standards can be a complex task involving several conflicting objectives. In this sense, PLA can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. This research presents an approach that helps DMs (Decision Makers) to interactively optimize the PLAs through several strategies such as interactive optimization and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The interactive multiobjective optimization approach for PLA design (iMOA4PLA) uses specific metrics for the PLA optimization problem, implemented through the OPLA-Tool v2.0. In this approach, the architect assumes the role of DM during the search process, guiding the evolution of PLAs through various strategies proposed in previous works. Two quantitative and one qualitative experiments were performed to evaluate the iMOA4PLA. The results showed that this approach can assist the PLA optimization process by meeting more than 90},

  abstract  = {Systematic evaluation of the geotechnical parameters of rock slopes facilitates predicting the risk level of slope excavation processes and reliability analysis of geotechnical engineering. The distribution of geomechanical parameters of rock slopes is complex, and accurately determining the value and spatial distribution of rock mass parameters is crucial for predicting slope stability. The field-measured data is adopted to determine conditioned random fields based on the Kriging method to speculate the distribution of slope shear strength parameters. The uncertainties in shear strength parameters (friction angle and cohesion) are considered, and parameter random fields are established. The reliability analysis of the rock slope is accomplished by the multivariate adaptive regression splines method. The validity of the process is verified by taking the left bank excavation slope of Jinping I (JP-1 for short) hydropower station as an instance, and the influence of the fluctuation scale on the slope stability analysis is explored. The results show that the approach can efficaciously determine the parameter distribution, establish the parameter random fields, and evaluate the slope reliability. The failure probability of slope increases with the increase of the fluctuation scale.},

Thus, no rigorous connection between the design and the development of a robot controller is established. This paper presents a framework for designing robotic controllers with support for automatic generation of executable code and automatic property checking. A state-machine based notation, RoboChart, and a tool (RoboTool) that implements the automatic generation of code and mathematical models from the designed controllers are presented. We demonstrate the application of RoboChart and its related tool through a case study of a robot performing an exploration task. The automatically generated code is platform independent and is used in both simulation and two different physical robotic platforms. Properties are formally checked against the mathematical models generated by RoboTool, and further validated in the actual simulations and physical experiments. The tool not only provides engineers with a way of designing robotic controllers formally but also paves the way for correct implementation of robotic systems.},

We propose a novel approach to identify neobanks, based on non-financial hand-collected data, and identify 65 neobanks operating in Europe. We show that neobanks perform worse than their traditional peers, while recording a similar level of risk. Namely, neobanks charge higher interest income, record higher impairment charges, and face higher non-staff expenses. Further analysis suggests the presence of economies of scale and scope in digital banking. Our findings are robust to endogeneity concerns and changes to our baseline specification.},

  abstract  = {Climate change reduces snowpack, advances snowmelt phenology, drives summer warming, alters growing season precipitation regimes, and consequently modifies vegetation phenology in mountain systems. Elevational migrants track spatial variation in seasonal plant growth by moving between ranges at different elevations during spring, so climate-driven vegetation change may disrupt historic benefits of migration. Elevational migrants can furthermore cope with short-term environmental variability by undertaking brief vertical movements to refugia when sudden adverse conditions arise. We uncover drivers of fine-scale vertical movement variation during upland migration in an endangered alpine specialist, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis sierrae ) using a 20-year study of GPS collar data collected from 311 unique individuals. We used integrated step-selection analysis to determine factors that promote vertical movements and drive selection of destinations following vertical movements. Our results reveal that relatively high temperatures consistently drive uphill movements, while precipitation likely drives downhill movements. Furthermore, bighorn select destinations at their peak annual biomass and maximal time since snowmelt. These results indicate that although Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep seek out foraging opportunities related to landscape phenology, they compensate for short-term environmental stressors by undertaking brief up- and downslope vertical movements. Migrants may therefore be impacted by future warming and increased storm frequency or intensity, with shifts in annual migration timing, and fine-scale vertical movement responses to environmental variability.},

  abstract  = {The rendering efficiency of Monte Carlo path tracing often depends on the ease of path construction. For scenes with particularly complex visibility, e.g. where the camera and light sources are placed in separate rooms connected by narrow doorways or windows, it is difficult to construct valid paths using traditional path tracing algorithms such as unidirectional path tracing or bidirectional path tracing. Light portal is a class of methods that assist in sampling direct light paths based on prior knowledge of the scene. It usually requires additional manual editing and labelling by the artist or renderer user. Tri-directional path tracing is a sophisticated path tracing algorithm that combines bidirectional path tracing and light portals sampling, but the original work lacks sufficient analysis to demonstrate its effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an automatic light portal generation algorithm based on spatial radiosity analysis that mitigates the cost of manual operations for complex scenes. We also further analyse and improve the light portal-based tri-directional path tracing rendering algorithm, giving a detailed analysis of path construction strategies, algorithm complexity, and the unbiasedness of the Monte Carlo estimation. The experimental results show that our algorithm can accurately locate the light portals with low computational cost and effectively improve the rendering performance of complex scenes.},

  abstract  = {Human–robot collaborative assembly (HRCA) is one of the hot trends in intelligent manufacturing and has gained the attention of many researchers. In HRCA, errors in assembly sequence may reduce working efficiency and damage workpieces. To detect the assembly sequence errors rapidly and not influence the assembly process, the assembly sequence monitoring system demands high real-time performance and non-contact requirements. Therefore, an assembly sequence monitoring method based on workflow modeling is proposed for HRCA. The framework of the monitoring method is divided into an assembly state recognition block, an action library, and a monitoring block. The assembly state recognition block characterizes the complicated and unstructured assembly environment as a state vector in real time. The action library is constructed to model the workflow of the assembly sequences. The monitoring block matches the state-change vector calculated from the state vectors with defined actions in the action library and outputs the monitoring result. The assembly state recognition block is tested in simulation, and the assembly sequence monitoring method is validated in simulation and real-world experiments to exhibit the effectiveness. The comparison with other similar methods illustrates the superiority in monitoring range and recognition accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The diurnal variation in precipitation is an essential aspect of the hydrological cycle. It is also an effective way to assess the model performance and understand the local climate. However, there is still a lack of detailed evaluation and in-depth analyses of precipitation at the sub-daily scale for kilometer-scale dynamical downscaling simulations. In this study, we evaluated the precipitation outputs from quarter-degree dynamical downscaling modeling (28kmDDM) and kilometer-scale dynamical downscaling modeling (4kmDDM) at the sub-daily scale over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the summer of 2014. The advantages and disadvantages of kilometer-scale simulation are well-dissected. Our findings indicated that 4kmDDM is clearly advantageous for capturing daily-scale precipitation features, primarily due to its superior ability to simulate convective precipitation during the day. On the contrary, compared to the station observations, 4kmDDM exhibits a nocturnal underestimation, particularly in the southeastern basins of the TP, where steep topographic relief exists. Compared to 28kmDDM, 4kmDDM simulates more realistic surface air temperatures and abundant precipitable water vapor. However, the formation of low-level clouds in 4kmDDM is limited due to insufficient condensation. Under stable nocturnal stratification, 4kmDDM lacks the potential to trigger more condensation in the middle and high layers without low-level condensation latent heating. Fewer clouds and hydrometeors are the primary factors contributing to nocturnal precipitation underestimation. This study highlights the discrepancies of the kilometer-scale simulation in nocturnal precipitation under stable stratification.},

  abstract  = {Global climate models (GCMs) are essential for studying the climate system and climate change projections. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, downscaling is necessary on the regional scale. Regional climate models (RCMs) represent a standard solution for this issue. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions provided by GCMs unavoidably influence the outputs of RCMs. This study evaluates CMIP6 GCMs regarding the variables relevant to RCM boundary conditions. Particular focus is on the simulation of CNRM-ESM2-1, which is being used as a driving model for convection-permitting ALARO-Climate RCM, used as one source feeding new Czech climate change scenarios. The analysis is conducted over the boundaries and inside the RCM integration domain. Firstly, an evaluation of CFSR and ERA5 reanalyses against radiosondes is performed to choose an appropriate reference dataset for upper air variables. A high correlation between the two studied reanalysis and radiosondes was revealed, and it slightly decreases at the upper tropospheric levels. ERA5 is then chosen as the reference for the boundary analysis. Over the inner region, the simulated mean annual cycle of impact-relevant variables is validated against E-OBS. The CNRM-ESM2-1 performs well regarding near-surface variables over the Czech Republic, but it exhibits larger errors along the boundaries, especially for air temperature and specific humidity. The GCM performance in simulating the upper air atmospheric variables used as RCM boundary conditions relates rather weakly to the GCM performance in simulating the near-surface parameters in the inner region in terms of parameters relevant for impact studies.},

  abstract  = {The synergy of edge computing and Machine Learning (ML) holds immense potential for revolutionizing Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly in scenarios characterized by high-speed, continuous data generation. Offline ML algorithms struggle with streaming data as they rely on static datasets for model construction. In contrast, Online Machine Learning (OML) adapts to changing environments by training the model with each new observation in real-time. However, developing OML algorithms introduces complexities such as bias and variance considerations, making the selection of suitable estimators challenging. In this challenging landscape, ensemble learning emerges as a promising approach, offering a strategic framework to navigate the bias-variance tradeoff and enhance prediction accuracy by amalgamating outputs from diverse ML models. This paper introduces a novel ensemble method tailored for edge computing environments, designed to efficiently operate on resource-constrained devices while accommodating various online learning scenarios. The primary objective is to enhance predictive accuracy at the edge, thereby empowering IoT applications with robust decision-making capabilities. Our study addresses the critical challenges of ML in resource-constrained edge computing environments, offering practical insights for enhancing predictive accuracy and scalability in IoT applications. To validate our ensemble’s efficacy, we conducted comprehensive experimental evaluations leveraging both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that our ensemble surpassed state-of-the-art data stream algorithms and ensemble regressors across a range of regression metrics, underlining its superior predictive prowess. Furthermore, we scrutinized the ensemble’s performance within the realm of auto-scaling for Virtual Network Function (VNF)-based applications situated at the network’s edge, thereby elucidating its applicability and scalability in real-world scenarios.},

We provide an efficient one for stochastic Volterra processes, based on an extension of Donsker’s approximation of Brownian motion to the fractional Brownian case with arbitrary Hurst exponent H ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) $H \in (0,1)$ . Some of the most relevant consequences of this ‘rough Donsker (rDonsker) theorem’ are functional weak convergence results in Skorokhod space for discrete approximations of a large class of rough stochastic volatility models. This justifies the validity of simple and easy-to-implement Monte Carlo methods, for which we provide detailed numerical recipes. We test these against the current benchmark hybrid scheme and find remarkable agreement (for a large range of values of  H $H$ ). Our rDonsker theorem further provides a weak convergence proof for the hybrid scheme itself and allows constructing binomial trees for rough volatility models, the first available scheme (in the rough volatility context) for early exercise options such as American or Bermudan options.},

Second, we propose a refactoring technique to replace inefficient process fragments in business process models with efficient process fragments. After refactoring, concurrent execution of business tasks in efficient process fragments can be maximized, so the efficiency of business process models can be improved.

In this Review, we summarize how landscape attributes, rainfall and burn severity influence post-fire geomorphic responses over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Sub-hourly rainfall intensity and burn severity control the magnitude of many post-fire geomorphic process rates through their influence on ground cover and rainfall-runoff partitioning. Post-fire debris flows (PFDFs) make a substantial contribution to the post-fire sediment cascade, transporting sediment from hillslopes to channels, adjacent floodplains and alluvial fans.

  abstract  = {Quaternary palynology plays a pivotal role in investigating global climate change and various other research fields, serving as an essential tool for the quantitative analysis of paleoenvironment changes. However, due to the vast diversity of terrestrial ecosystems and intricate interactions between vegetation, climate, and human activities, further advancements are required in the following aspects within this discipline. (1) The accuracy of classification in pollen morphology and fossil pollen identification needs improvement, particularly at the species level. This represents a significant challenge in present Quaternary palynology. Computer-aided intelligent recognition holds promise as a solution for species identification based on more detail pollen morphology. (2) Most pollen-based vegetation and climate reconstructions overlook the significance of bare ground. Neglecting bare ground can lead to substantial inaccuracies when quantitatively reconstructing past vegetation and climate. (3) While pollen records provide reliable information on paleoclimate changes, current quantitative climate reconstruction models heavily rely on modern pollen datasets derived from present-day vegetation disturbed more or less by human activities. This introduces bias and uncertainties into paleoclimate reconstruction. (4) Although pollen can serve as an indicator of human activities, accurately quantifying the intensity of human influence remains challenging. Improving accurate identification of crop pollen, reconstructing reliable land cover/use data, and integrating multidisciplinary data may enhance the identification and quantification of signals related to human activity in pollen records.},

  abstract  = {In recent decades, Southwest China (SWC) has suffered from frequent super droughts, leading to severe economic losses and ecological degradation. This study investigates the characteristics of super droughts in SWC during 1961–2022, reveals the compounding effect of multiscalar anomalies, and explores the plausible atmospheric circulation mechanisms responsible. The nature of super drought is a compound drought caused by the superposition of extreme drought events across multiple time scales. By contrasting the typical drought cases in 2006 and 2022, the decisive role of multiscalar drought compounding is confirmed. Based on the Comprehensive Multiscalar Index (CMI), multiple super drought events in SWC were identified to be temporally clustered during 2006–2014. Among them, the decadal background of enhanced evaporation and precipitation deficit at long time scales is a necessary condition for shaping the overall pattern of super droughts, while the precipitation and evaporation anomalies at short time scales trigger the outbreak of super droughts, determining the exact timing of occurrence. These events include August–September 2006, November 2009 to May 2010, July–October 2011, April–May 2012, January–April 2013, etc. Statistical results suggest that the contribution of superposed precipitation anomalies to super drought is 2.4 times that of evaporation. As regards the circulation mechanisms affecting multiscalar precipitation, the anomalous spatial patterns at short-term and long-term scales are similar, featuring the cyclonic circulation over the South China Sea and the northeasterly wind anomalies together with the subsidence center over SWC. During 2006–2014, the possible causes for the cross-seasonal persistent precipitation reduction in SWC are the extreme negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in the North Pacific as well as the pronounced warming of the warm pool in the western Pacific. The key dynamic processes are outlined as follows. On the one hand, the negative PDO phase generates anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the North Pacific, with the northeasterly winds on its southwest flank extending to Southeast Asia, hindering moisture transport into SWC. On the other hand, the warming of the warm pool excites anomalous cyclonic circulation to its northwest, also giving rise to northeasterly wind anomalies over SWC. Meanwhile, the ascending motion over the warm pool region diverges at upper levels with outflows converging aloft over SWC, which further induces compensating downward motion there. The combined effect of the above two remote forcings establishes a climatic background state unfavorable for precipitation over SWC at long time scales, thus constituting a crucial prerequisite for the superimposition of short-term precipitation anomalies to develop into super droughts.},

The involvement of the circadian clock in photoperiodic time measurement synchronising annual rhythms is still under debate and different models have been proposed explaining their integration. Insects overcome unfavourable conditions in diapause, a form of dormancy. A latitudinal cline in diapause induction in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis as well as a difference in circadian light sensitivity between north and south provide us with additional evidence that the circadian system of Nasonia is involved in photoperiodic time measurement and that latitude-specific seasonality drives adaptive evolution in photoperiodism partly through adaptation responses in the circadian system. We tested diapause induction in a range of T-cycles and photoperiods and found diapause induction in short photoperiods in all T-cycles in the northern line but in the southern line, diapause only occurred in T-cycles close to 24 h. Due to a lower light sensitivity in the southern line, a wider distribution of phase angles of entrainment can be expected at a specific T-cycle duration, while the range of entrainment will decrease. Taking these oscillator properties into account, our data can be explained by an external coincidence model involving a single oscillator with a light-sensitive phase that drives annual timing of diapause in Nasonia vitripennis .},

Such structures are widely seen in the molecular networks in cells, suggesting that a universal evolutionary mechanism underlies the emergence of bow-tie architecture. The previous theoretical studies have implemented evolutionary simulations of the feedforward network to satisfy a given input-output goal and proposed that the bow-tie architecture emerges when the ideal input-output relation is given as a rank-deficient matrix with mutations in network link intensities in a multiplicative manner. Here, we report that the bow-tie network inevitably appears when the link intensities representing molecular interactions are small at the initial condition of the evolutionary simulation, regardless of the rank of the goal matrix. Our dynamical system analysis clarifies the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the bow-tie structure. Further, we demonstrate that the increase in the input-output matrix reduces the width of the middle layer, resulting in the emergence of bow-tie architecture, even when evolution starts from large link intensities. Our data suggest that bow-tie architecture emerges as a side effect of evolution rather than as a result of evolutionary adaptation.},

  abstract  = {Background The cell cycle of mammary stem cells must be tightly regulated to ensure normal homeostasis of the mammary gland to prevent abnormal proliferation and susceptibility to tumorigenesis. The atypical cell cycle regulator, Spy1 can override cell cycle checkpoints, including those activated by the tumour suppressor p53 which mediates mammary stem cell homeostasis. Spy1 has also been shown to promote expansion of select stem cell populations in other developmental systems. Spy1 protein is elevated during proliferative stages of mammary gland development, is found at higher levels in human breast cancers, and promotes susceptibility to mammary tumourigenesis when combined with loss of p53. We hypothesized that Spy1 cooperates with loss of p53 to increase susceptibility to tumour initiation due to changes in susceptible mammary stem cell populations during development and drives the formation of more aggressive stem like tumours. Methods Using a transgenic mouse model driving expression of Spy1 within the mammary gland, mammary development and stemness were assessed. These mice were intercrossed with p53 null mice to study the tumourigenic properties of Spy1 driven p53 null tumours, as well as global changes in signaling via RNA sequencing analysis. Results We show that elevated levels of Spy1 leads to expansion of mammary stem cells, even in the presence of p53, and an increase in mammary tumour formation. Spy1-driven tumours have an increased cancer stem cell population, decreased checkpoint signaling, and demonstrate an increase in therapy resistance. Loss of Spy1 decreases tumor onset and reduces the cancer stem cell population. Conclusions This data demonstrates the potential of Spy1 to expand mammary stem cell populations and contribute to the initiation and progression of aggressive, breast cancers with increased cancer stem cell populations.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural production assessments are crucial for formulating strategies for closing yield gaps and enhancing production efficiencies. While in situ crop yield measurements can provide valuable and accurate information, such approaches are costly and lack scalability for large-scale assessments. Therefore, crop modeling and remote sensing (RS) technologies are essential for assessing crop conditions and predicting yields at larger scales. In this study, we combined RS and a crop growth model to assess phenology, evapotranspiration (ET), and yield dynamics at grid and sub-county scales in Kenya. We synthesized RS information from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Water Productivity Open-access portal (WaPOR) to retrieve sowing date information for driving the model simulations. The findings showed that grid-scale management information and progressive crop growth could be accurately derived, reducing the model output uncertainties. Performance assessment of the modeled phenology yielded satisfactory accuracies at the sub-county scale during two representative seasons. The agreement between the simulated ET and yield was improved with the combined RS-crop model approach relative to the crop model only, demonstrating the value of additional large-scale RS information. The proposed approach supports crop yield estimation in data-scarce environments and provides valuable insights for agricultural resource management enabling countermeasures, especially when shortages are perceived in advance, thus enhancing agricultural production.},

Specifically, the stochastic uncertainty in the system is represented with random variables while epistemic uncertainty is represented using non-probabilistic uncertain variables with belief functions. The mixed uncertainty is propagated through the system, resulting in the uncertainty in the chosen quantities of interest (QoI, such as flow volume, cost of transport and work). With the introduced numerical method, the uncertainty in the statistics of QoIs will be represented using belief functions. With three representative probability distributions consistent with the belief structure, global sensitivity analysis has also been implemented to identify important uncertain factors and the results have been compared between different peristalsis models. To reduce the computational cost, physics constrained generalized polynomial chaos method is adopted to construct cheaper surrogates as approximations for the full simulation.},

  abstract  = {Bathymetry-based numerical simulations suggest small-scale seafloor roughness in the continental shelf of East Antarctica slows the circulation of circumpolar deep water and limits heat supply to the ice shelf—a mechanism missing from climate models. Heat delivered by the ocean circulation is melting the Antarctic ice sheet from below. This melt is largest where warm Circumpolar Deep Water accesses the continental shelf and reaches the ice shelf cavities. Future melt rate projections are based on ocean thermal forcing derived from climate models, which tend to be biased warm around Antarctica. The bias has been attributed to unresolved ocean processes that occur at scales poorly represented in models. Using a high-resolution model of the Denman Glacier region we show that seafloor roughness unresolved in climate models suppresses the impact of warm water on ice sheet melting. Seafloor roughness slows down the shelf circulation, reducing the presence of warm water over the shelf and the heat transport towards the ice cavities. As a result, the total meltwater discharge drops by 4 Gt year^−1. Our results suggest a mechanism missing in global ocean and climate models that could reduce the spread in climate projections.},

More importantly, the feasibility of the surrogate-based CCD method is analyzed theoretically, and on the ground of the analysis, a novel adaptive sampling strategy based on distance clustering and maximum predictor errors, named DCMPE, is presented to assist the Kriging technique in approximating the state equation. Finally, three examples illustrate that the adaptive Kriging surrogate-based CCD method combined with DCMPE not only solves the CCD problems efficiently, but also provides a more accurate CCD solution with less computational effort compared to existing surrogate-based methods.},

  abstract  = {To deal with the highly nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of Batch Process, a model named adaptive stacking approximate kernel based broad learning system is proposed in this paper. This model innovatively introduces the approximate kernel based broad learning system (AKBLS) algorithm and the Adaptive Stacking framework, giving it strong nonlinear fitting ability, excellent generalization ability, and adaptive ability. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is known for its shorter training time for effective nonlinear processing, but the uncertainty brought by its double random mapping results in poor resistance to noisy data and unpredictable impact on performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an AKBLS algorithm that reduces uncertainty, eliminates redundant features, and improves prediction accuracy by projecting feature nodes into the kernel space. It also significantly reduces the computation time of the kernel matrix by searching for approximate kernels to enhance its ability in industrial online applications. Extensive comparative experiments on various public datasets of different sizes validate this. The Adaptive Stacking framework utilizes the Stacking ensemble learning method, which integrates predictions from multiple AKBLS models using a meta-learner to improve generalization. Additionally, by employing the moving window method—where a fixed-length window slides through the database over time—the model gains adaptive ability, allowing it to better respond to gradual changes in industrial Batch Process. Experiments on a substantial dataset of penicillin simulations demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves predictive accuracy compared to other common algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Background BERT models have seen widespread use on unstructured text within the clinical domain. However, little to no research has been conducted into classifying unstructured clinical notes on the basis of patient lifestyle indicators, especially in Dutch. This article aims to test the feasibility of deep BERT models on the task of patient lifestyle classification, as well as introducing an experimental framework that is easily reproducible in future research. Methods This study makes use of unstructured general patient text data from HagaZiekenhuis, a large hospital in The Netherlands. Over 148 000 notes were provided to us, which were each automatically labelled on the basis of the respective patients’ smoking, alcohol usage and drug usage statuses. In this paper we test feasibility of automatically assigning labels, and justify it using hand-labelled input. Ultimately, we compare macro F1-scores of string matching, SGD and several BERT models on the task of classifying smoking, alcohol and drug usage. We test Dutch BERT models and English models with translated input. Results We find that our further pre-trained MedRoBERTa.nl-HAGA model outperformed every other model on smoking (0.93) and drug usage (0.77). Interestingly, our ClinicalBERT model that was merely fine-tuned on translated text performed best on the alcohol task (0.80). In t-SNE visualisations, we show our MedRoBERTa.nl-HAGA model is the best model to differentiate between classes in the embedding space, explaining its superior classification performance. Conclusions We suggest MedRoBERTa.nl-HAGA to be used as a baseline in future research on Dutch free text patient lifestyle classification. We furthermore strongly suggest further exploring the application of translation to input text in non-English clinical BERT research, as we only translated a subset of the full set and yet achieved very promising results.},

  abstract  = {The verification of model transformations is important for realizing robust model-driven engineering technologies and quality-assured automation. Many approaches for checking properties of model transformations have been proposed. Most of them have focused on the effective and efficient detection of property violations by contract checking. However, there remains the fault localization step between identifying a failing contract for a transformation based on verification feedback and precisely identifying the faulty rules. While there exist fault localization approaches in the model transformation verification literature, these require the creation and maintenance of test cases , which imposes an additional burden on the developer. In this paper, we combine transformation verification based on symbolic execution with spectrum-based fault localization techniques for identifying the faulty rules in DSLTrans model transformations. This fault localization approach operates on the path condition output of symbolic transformation checkers instead of requiring a set of test input models. In particular, we introduce a workflow for running the symbolic execution of a model transformation, evaluating the defined contracts for satisfaction, and computing different measures for tracking the faulty rules. We evaluate the effectiveness of spectrum-based analysis techniques for tracking faulty rules and compare our approach to previous works. We evaluate our technique by introducing known mutations into five model transformations.

We strictly adhere to test-driven development for validation, and only afterwards apply model checking using CBMC for verification. While the approach has several benefits compared to the more rigorous approaches, it also provides less mathematical clarity and overall less thorough verification. In consequence, our realization of the ABZ case study serves as a baseline reference for comparison, allowing to assess the benefit provided by the various formal modeling languages, methods and tools.},

  abstract  = {Models have long since been used, in different shapes and forms, to understand, communicate about, and (re)shape, the world around us; including many different social, economic, biological, chemical, physical, and digital aspects. This is also the case in the context of enterprise architecture (EA), where we see a wide range of models in many different shapes and forms being used as well. Researchers in EA modeling usually introduce their own lexicon, and perspective of what a model actually is, while accepting (often implicitly) the accompanying ontological commitments. Similarly, practitioners of EA modeling implicitly also commit to (different) ontologies, resulting in models that have an uncertain ontological standing. This is because, for the subject domain of enterprise architecture models (as opposed to the content of such models), no single ontology has gained major traction. As a result, studies into aspects of enterprise architecture models, such as “model quality” and “return on modeling effort”, are fragmented, and cannot readily be compared or combined. This paper proposes a comprehensive applied ontology, specifically geared to enterprise architecture modeling. Ontologies represent structured knowledge about a particular subject domain. It allows for study into, and reasoning about, that subject domain. Our ontology is derived from a theory of modeling, while clarifying concepts such as “enterprise architecture model”, and introduces novel concepts such as “model audience” and “model objective”. Furthermore, the relevant interrelations between these different concepts are identified and defined. The resulting ontology for enterprise architecture models is represented in OntoUML, and shown to be consistent with the foundational ontology for modeling, Unified Foundational Ontology.},

  title     = {Research on Credit Default Swaps Pricing Considering Moral Hazard Incentive under Reduce-Form Model},
  year      = {2024},

  volume    = {33},
  abstract  = {Equilibrium pricing of credit default swaps (CDS) promotes efficient identification of credit risk in the market, which in turn leads to efficient allocation of resources. However, even when CDS have been priced in equilibrium, i.e., when premiums are equal to anticipated payments, the moral hazard incentives of CDS buyers increase with CDS transactions. Consequentially, it becomes an interesting research direction to study the impact of moral hazard incentives on the trading mechanism or pricing of derivatives (CDS). Most of the existing literature on the impact of moral hazard incentives in CDS pricing on derivatives trading mechanisms takes a macro perspective and focuses on the agreement risk effect. The literature exploring the analysis of the impact of moral hazard on the probability of agreement default from a micro perspective is not yet available. With this in mind, this paper focuses on the mechanisms by which “fraud”, an extreme manifestation of micro-moral hazard incentives, affects the probability of default. This paper introduces for the first time the concept of “claiming fraud” by credit protection buyers, which is different from the macro perspective of moral hazard incentives, and thus defines a specific extreme form of moral hazard incentives. Meanwhile, to address the intrinsic feature of the lack of economic explanatory power of the reduce-form model, this paper introduces a moral hazard incentive factor into the reduce-form model, and proposes a moral hazard state variable as a function of the asset value of the reference entity, which gives the reduce-form model strong economic explanatory power, and the default predictability is reduced by the description of the reduce-form model. In terms of the object of study, this paper considers the issue of moral hazard incentives in the presence of claiming fraud in two reference entities to further explore the impact of moral hazard incentives on default protection at the micro level in terms of cyclic default. Finally, based on the analysis of the results of the numerical simulation experiments, it is proposed that increasing the number of reference assets for CDS buyers will help to reduce the moral hazard incentives of the buyer, and thus the anticipated payments to the buyer, i.e., we attempt to endogenize the credit risk of an asset by allowing the asset holder to choose the probability of the asset going up or down, which helps to understand the phenomenon of moral hazard incentives in CDS trading.},

(Cereeae; Cactaceae) from its sister species C. fernambucensis Lem. The Cereus insularis grows in the Fernando de Noronha Islands (FNI), a Neotropical archipelago located 350 km off the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) coast. Phylogeographic reconstructions support a northward expansion by the common ancestor of C. insularis and C. fernambucensis along the mainland BAF coast, with C. insularis diverging from the widespread mainland taxon C. fernambucensis after colonizing FNI in the late Pleistocene. The morphologically distinct C. insularis is monophyletic and nested within C. fernambucensis , as expected from a progenitor-derivative speciation model. We tested alternative biogeographic and demographic hypotheses for the colonization of the FNI using Approximate Bayesian Computation. We found the greatest support for a stepping-stone path that emerged during periods of decreased sea level (the “bridge” hypothesis), in congruence with historical ecological niche modeling that shows highly suitable habitats on stepping-stone islands during glacial periods. The outlier analyses reveal signatures of selection in C. insularis , suggesting a putative role of adaptation driving rapid anagenic differentiation of this species in FNI.},

  abstract  = {In the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship, digital technologies have ushered in new possibilities, attracting considerable academic attention. Despite the burgeoning research in Digital Entrepreneurship, the field remains fragmented, warranting a synthesized overview and structured research agenda. Consistently with the above, the paper presents a quantitative mapping of Digital Entrepreneurship through a bibliometric analysis of its publications. The research aims to address the need for a comprehensive, bibliometric overview of the topic, which has been echoed in recently published papers. In order to achieve this goal, we collected data from the Web of Science database, a common and scientifically sound choice in entrepreneurship research. The data were analyzed by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation and topic modeling, thus providing a unique approach to bibliometric mapping. Topic modeling allows for the processing and analysis of significant amounts of scientific data, thus making it an ideal tool for bibliometric research. We find the field of Digital Entrepreneurship to be rather lively and in rapid development, with several publication outlets, affiliations, and countries contributing to it. We found four main topics to be extracted: the implications of Digital Entrepreneurship for innovation, Digital Entrepreneurship as an enabler for empowerment, the transformation of business models through digitalization, and the surge of digital platforms as entrepreneurial ecosystems. Additionally, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the theoretical lenses used amid the sample and a structured research agenda built upon extant gaps. From a theoretical perspective, the article serves as a starting point for future research on the topic and a comprehensive analysis of its present and past. From a practical perspective, the study is of interest to digital entrepreneurs willing to learn more about the opportunities and challenges provided by the digital landscape.},

  abstract  = {Schiefer and Winfree recently introduced the chemical reaction network-controlled tile assembly model (CRN-TAM), a variant of the abstract tile assembly model (aTAM). In the CRN-TAM, tile reactions are mediated via non-local chemical signals controlled by a chemical reaction network. This paper introduces ALCH, an imperative programming language for specifying CRN-TAM programs that can be compiled and simulated. ALCH includes standard language features such as Boolean variables, conditionals, loops, and CRN-TAM-specific constructs such as adding and removing tiles. ALCH also includes the branch and parallel structures which harness the nondeterministic and parallel nature of the CRN-TAM. ALCH also supports functional tileset specification. Using ALCH, we show that the discrete Sierpinski triangle and the discrete Sierpinski carpet can be strictly self-assembled in the CRN-TAM, which shows the CRN-TAM can self-assemble infinite shapes at scale 1 that the aTAM cannot. ALCH allows us to present these constructions at a high level, abstracting species and reactions into C-like code that is simpler to understand. We employ two new CRN-TAM techniques in our constructions. First, we use ALCH’s nondeterministic branching feature to probe previously placed tiles of the assembly and detect the presence and absence of tiles. Second, we use scaffolding tiles to precisely control tile placement by occluding any undesired binding sites. This paper is an extension of our previous work, updated to include a Sierpinski carpet construction and the parallel command.},

In the numerical calculation of regional ocean waves, the wave climate characteristics exhibited significant bias if the influence of external swells (swells from afar) was not fully considered, which may provide an incorrect basis for global climate change analysis. 1) The trends of the significant wave height (SWH) obtained from the two datasets showed significant differences, such as those of the Bay of Bengal and the Java Sea in June–July–August. For the past 45 years, SWH from ERA-40 (SWH-ERA) exhibited a significant annual increase in low-latitude waters of the North Indian Ocean (0.2–0.6 cm yr^−1) and South China Sea (0.2–0.8 cm yr^−1). 2) In the Bay of Bengal, the SWH-ERA in each month was generally 0.5 m higher than the SWH from Mei’s hindcast wave data (SWH-Mei) and can reach 1.0 m higher in some months. 3) In the Bay of Bengal, SWH-ERA and SWH-Mei increased significantly at annual rates of 0.13 and 0.27 cm yr^−1, respectively. This increasing trend was mainly reflected after 1978. SWH-ERA showed a trough in 1975 (1.33 m) and a crest in 1992 (1.83 m), which were not reflected in SWH-Mei.},

  abstract  = {The advancement of computational resources has allowed researchers to run convection-permitting regional climate model (CPRCM) simulations. A pioneering effort promoting a multimodel ensemble of such simulations is the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Studies (FPS) on “Convective Phenomena over Europe and the Mediterranean” over an extended Alps region. In this study, the Distribution Added Value metric is used to determine the improvement of the representation of all available FPS hindcast simulations for the daily mean near-surface wind speed. The analysis is performed on normalized empirical probability distributions and considers station observation data as the reference. The use of a normalized metric allows for spatial comparison among the different regions (coast and inland), altitudes and seasons. This approach permits a direct assessment of the added value between the CPRCM simulations against their global driving reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and respective coarser resolution regional model counterparts. In general, the results show that CPRCMs add value to their global driving reanalysis or forcing regional model, due to better-resolved topography or through better representation of ocean-land contrasts. However, the nature and magnitude of the improvement in the wind speed representation vary depending on the model, the season, the altitude, or the region. Among seasons, the improvement is usually larger in summer than winter. CPRCMs generally display gains at low and medium-range altitudes. In addition, despite some shortcomings in comparison to ERA-Interim, which can be attributed to the assimilation of wind observations on the coast, the CPRCMs outperform the coarser regional climate models, both along the coast and inland.},

The IASBC, equipped with a coupled inductor, enhances load side performance by achieving high conversion efficiency and voltage gain while minimizing the impact of network parasitic. Additionally, the proposed controller technique effectively reduces output side dc ripple content through gain parameter optimization. The system is optimized for charging a 48 V rechargeable battery within a solar photovoltaic voltage range of 25–75 V DC. Extensive simulations using MATLAB validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The software analysis reveals an efficiency of 90.82},

  abstract  = {The reciprocal energy and enstrophy transfers between normal fluid and superfluid components dictate the overall dynamics of superfluid ^4He including the generation, evolution and coupling of coherent structures, the distribution of energy among lengthscales, and the decay of turbulence. To better understand the essential ingredients of this interaction, we employ a numerical two-way model which self-consistently accounts for the back-reaction of the superfluid vortex lines onto the normal fluid. Here we focus on a prototypical laminar (non-turbulent) vortex configuration which is simple enough to clearly relate the geometry of the vortex line to energy injection and dissipation to/from the normal fluid: a Kelvin wave excitation on two vortex anti-vortex pairs evolving in (a) an initially quiescent normal fluid, and (b) an imposed counterflow. In (a), the superfluid injects energy and vorticity in the normal fluid. In (b), the superfluid gains energy from the normal fluid via the Donnelly–Glaberson instability.},

  abstract  = {Human observers are known to frequently act like Bayes-optimal decision-makers. Growing evidence indicates that the deployment of the visual system may similarly be driven by probabilistic mental models of the environment. We tested whether eye movements during a dynamic interception task were indeed optimised according to Bayesian inference principles. Forty-one participants intercepted oncoming balls in a virtual reality racquetball task across five counterbalanced conditions in which the relative probability of the ball’s onset location was manipulated. Analysis of pre-onset gaze positions indicated that eye position tracked the true distribution of onset location, suggesting that the gaze system spontaneously adhered to environmental statistics. Eye movements did not, however, seek to minimise the distance between the target and foveal vision according to an optimal probabilistic model of the world and instead often reflected a ‘best guess’ about onset location. Trial-to-trial changes in gaze position were, however, found to be better explained by Bayesian learning models (hierarchical Gaussian filter) than associative learning models. Additionally, parameters relating to the precision of beliefs and prediction errors extracted from the participant-wise models were related to both task-evoked pupil dilations and variability in gaze positions, providing further evidence that probabilistic context was reflected in spontaneous gaze dynamics.},

  abstract  = {Cranial dura mater is a dense interwoven vascularized connective tissue that helps regulate neurocranial remodeling by responding to strains from the growing brain. Previous ex vivo experimentation has failed to account for the role of prestretch in the mechanical behavior of the dura. Here we aim to estimate the prestretch in mouse cranial dura mater and determine its dependency on direction and age. We performed transverse and longitudinal incisions in parietal dura excised from newborn (day 
$$\sim$$
 ∼ 4) and mature (12 weeks) mice and calculated the ex vivo normalized incision opening (measured width over length). Then, similar incisions were simulated under isotropic stretching within Abaqus/Standard. Finally, prestretch was estimated by comparing the ex vivo and in silico normalized openings. There were no significant differences between the neonatal and adult mice when comparing cuts in the same direction, but adult mice were found to have significantly greater stretch in the anterior–posterior direction than in the medial–lateral direction, while neonatal dura was essentially isotropic. Additionally, our simulations show that increasing curvature impacts the incision opening, indicating that flat in silico models may overestimate prestretch.},

  abstract  = {The servitization of business is moving industry to business models driven by customer demand. Customer satisfaction is connected with financial rewards, forcing companies to invest in their users’ experience. User journeys describe how users maneuver through a service. Today, user journeys are typically modeled graphically, and lack formalization and analysis support. This paper proposes a formalization of user journeys as weighted games between the user and the service provider and a systematic data-driven method to derive these user journey games from system logs, using process mining techniques. As the derived games may contain cycles, we define an algorithm to transform user journeys games with cycles into acyclic weighted games, which can be model checked using to uncover potential challenges in a company’s interactions with its users and derive company strategies to guide users through their journeys. Finally, we propose a user journey sliding-window analysis to detect changes in the user journey over time by model checking a sequence of generated games. Our analysis pipeline has been evaluated on an industrial case study; it revealed design challenges within the studied service and could be used to derive actionable recommendations for improvement.},

This paper examines the persistence in macroeconomic and financial variables for Turkey by means of the recent developments in the quantile autoregression models to account for non-normal distributions, structural changes, and asymmetric dynamics. The results show that while the conventional unit root approaches fail to reject the null hypothesis of unit root for most the of 30 macroeconomic and financial time series, the nonlinear quantile unit root test with smooth structural changes supports evidence on a stable long-run equilibrium for 23 variables. It further reveals asymmetric persistence in most of the Turkey’s macroeconomic and financial data, implying that the effect of an economic shock in inflationary state is different than that in recessionary state.},

  abstract  = {Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) remains a significant medical concern, with its asymptomatic nature posing diagnostic and monitoring challenges, thereby increasing the risk of aortic wall dissection and rupture. Current management of aortic repair relies on an aortic diameter threshold. However, this approach underestimates the complexity of aortic wall disease due to important knowledge gaps in understanding its underlying pathologic mechanisms. Since traditional risk factors cannot explain the initiation and progression of ATAA leading to dissection, local vascular factors such as extracellular matrix (ECM) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) might harbor targets for early diagnosis and intervention. Derived from diverse embryonic lineages, VSMCs exhibit varied responses to genetic abnormalities that regulate their contractility. The transition of VSMCs into different phenotypes is an adaptive response to stress stimuli such as hemodynamic changes resulting from cardiovascular disease, aging, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. Upon longer exposure to stress stimuli, VSMC phenotypic switching can instigate pathologic remodeling that contributes to the pathogenesis of ATAA. This review aims to illuminate the current understanding of cellular and molecular characteristics associated with ATAA and dissection, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced comprehension of the impaired ECM–VSMC network.},

  abstract  = {Ecological restoration of bauxite residue has received extensive attention, and organic matter plays a crucial role in the soil formation process of bauxite residue. However, the interaction between organic matter and alkaline minerals in bauxite residue is not well understood. In this work, molecular spectroscopic techniques combined with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were employed to investigate the interactions between humic acid (HA) and four representative alkaline minerals in bauxite residue (calcite, garnet, sodalite, and cancrinite). The results show that the adsorption processes of HA onto calcite and garnet were primarily governed by monolayer surface adsorption and controlled by surface reactions, which were different for sodalite and cancrinite. Both garnet and cancrinite had strong binding affinities with fluorescent HA, while cancrinite only bound with a small fraction of HA. In contrast, the bindings of calcite and sodalite with fluorescent HA were weak. The ITC results indicate distinct thermodynamic properties of different alkaline minerals in the interaction with HA. The molar enthalpy of calcite was − 45.88 kJ/mol, which was much higher than those of garnet, sodalite, and cancrinite, suggesting that calcite exhibited a relatively uniform interaction mechanism with HA dominated by enthalpy change, while the others showed heterogeneous entropy-driven mechanisms. The findings contribute to a better understanding on the microscale connections between organic matter and alkaline minerals in bauxite residue.},

  abstract  = {Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) aims to reflect solar radiation by increasing the stratospheric aerosol burden. To understand how the background circulation influences stratospheric transport of injected particles, we use a Lagrangian trajectory model (lacking numerical diffusion) to quantify particles’ number, flux, lifetime, and tropospheric sinks from a SAI injection strategy under present-day conditions. While particles are being injected, stratospheric particle number increases until reaching a steady-state. During the steady-state, the time series of particle number shows a dominant period of  2 years (rather than a 1-year cycle), suggesting modulation by the quasi-biannual oscillation. More than half of particles, injected in the tropical lower stratosphere (15° S to 15° N, 65 hPa), undergo quasi-horizontal transport to the midlatitude. We find a zonal asymmetry of particles’ tropospheric sinks that are co-located with tropopause folding beneath the midlatitude jet stream, which can help predict tropospheric impacts of SAI (e.g., cirrus cloud thinning).},

While dealing with the security challenges, several authentication schemes, protocols, processes, and standards have been adopted. Consequently, making the right decision regarding the installation of a secure authentication solution or procedure becomes tricky and challenging due to the large number of security protocols, complexity, and lack of understanding. The major objective of this study is to propose an IoHT-based assessment framework for evaluating and prioritizing authentication schemes in the healthcare domain. Initially, in the proposed work, the security issues related to authentication are collected from the literature and consulting experts’ groups. In the second step, features of various authentication schemes are collected under the supervision of an Internet of Things security expert using the Delphi approach. The collected features are used to design suitable criteria for assessment and then Graph Theory and Matrix approach applies for the evaluation of authentication alternatives. Finally, the proposed framework is tested and validated to ensure the results are consistent and accurate by using other multi-criteria decision-making methods. The framework produces promising results such as 93},

We employ a spillover connectedness model driven by time-varying parameter vector autoregressions on daily data covering January 2018 to November 2022 to analyze spillover transmissions between conventional and digital markets, focusing on the role of stablecoin issuances. We study the stock, bond, cryptocurrency, and stablecoin markets and find very high connectedness, which varies over time in response to up/down trends in financial markets. The results show that during financial turmoil, cryptocurrencies amplify downside risks rather than serve as diversifiers. In addition to risky assets from conventional financial markets, cryptocurrencies champion the transmission of spillovers to digital and conventional markets. In contrast, changes in stablecoin issuances produce few shocks because of their pegged prices, but they facilitate investors’ switch from volatile cryptos to more stable digital instruments; that is, we observe a phenomenon designated by us as the “flight-to-cryptosafety.” We draw insightful conclusions, provoking new thinking regarding portfolio hedge strategies that could potentially benefit investors when searching for less volatile investment performance.},

A precise shape of the target edge is crucial for segmenting small infrared targets. However, existing CNN-based methods do not effectively integrate the edge and shape information of the target, leading to the distortion of the detected target shape. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes an edge-enhanced assistance network (EEA-Net) for IRSTD. Specifically, we design an edge-gate module (E-G) to extract the edge information and convey it to deep layers through a cascading structure. Based on E-G, we further propose an information-preserving attention module (IPA) to reduce the loss of edge information in the network. In addition, we design a global perception module (GP) to facilitate the flow of edge information and enhance the network’s ability to fuse information at multiple scales. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art IRSTD methods.},

The findings reveal a convergence in the level of operational and environmental efficiency, with similar trends and reduced gaps over the study period, except in crises periods, as both influenced by economic activity levels and the Covid-19 pandemic. The results highlight a discernible trend among U.S. OGCs towards reduced CO_2 emissions in recent years.

  abstract  = {Context Code annotations have gained widespread popularity in programming languages, offering developers the ability to attach metadata to code elements to define custom behaviors. Many modern frameworks and APIs use annotations to keep integration less verbose and located nearer to the corresponding code element. Despite these advantages, practitioners’ anecdotal evidence suggests that annotations might negatively affect code readability. Objective To better understand this effect, this paper systematically investigates the relationship between code annotations and code readability. Method In a survey with software developers (n=332), we present 15 pairs of Java code snippets with and without code annotations. These pairs were designed considering five categories of annotation used in real-world Java frameworks and APIs. Survey participants selected the code snippet they considered more readable for each pair and answered an open question about how annotations affect the code’s readability. Results Preferences were scattered for all categories of annotation usage, revealing no consensus among participants. The answers were spread even when segregated by participants’ programming or annotation-related experience. Nevertheless, some participants showed a consistent preference in favor or against annotations across all categories, which may indicate a personal preference. Our qualitative analysis of the open-ended questions revealed that participants often praise annotation impacts on design, maintainability, and productivity but expressed contrasting views on understandability and code clarity. Conclusions Software developers and API designers can consider our results when deciding whether to use annotations, equipped with the insight that developers express contrasting views of the annotations’ impact on code readability.},

  abstract  = {The adoption of high-performance computing (HPC) in healthcare has gained significant attention in recent years, driving advancements in medical research and clinical practice. Exploring the literature on HPC implementation in healthcare is valuable for decision-makers as it provides insights into potential areas for further investigation and investment. However, manually analyzing the vast number of scholarly articles is a challenging and time-consuming task. Fortunately, topic modeling techniques offer the capacity to process extensive volumes of scientific literature, identifying key trends within the field. This paper presents an automatic literature analysis framework based on a state-of-art vector-based topic modeling algorithm with multiple embedding techniques, unveiling the research trends surrounding HPC utilization in healthcare. The proposed pipeline consists of four phases: paper extraction, data preprocessing, topic modeling and outlier detection, followed by visualization. It enables the automatic extraction of meaningful topics, exploration of their interrelationships, and identification of emerging research directions in an intuitive manner.

  abstract  = {The development of smart and innovative software applications in various disciplines has inspired our lives by providing various cutting-edge technologies spanning from online to smart and efficient systems. The proliferation of innovative internet-enabled tools has transformed the nation into a globalized world where individuals can participate on various platforms, collaborate in activities, communicate on issues, and exchange information safely and consistently. Coordination and cooperation are essential in software development. It gathers all software developers in one space, encouraging them to discuss goals and work rationally to accomplish the project goal. In recent years, continuous software development and deployment have become increasingly common in software engineering. Continuous software engineering (CSE) is a method that involves a variety of strategies to increase the regularity of novel and modified software versions. CSE enables a continuous learning and improvement process through rapid software update iteration by combining continuous integration and delivery. Continuous integration is a method that has arisen in order to remove gaps between development and deployment. Software engineers must handle uncertainty and alter stakeholders' requirements, which is possible through continuous software developmental strategies that manage the overall software cycle and produce high-quality software applications. The proposed study is a systematic review related to continuous software development and deployment and focuses on achieving four aims: (1) To explore the impacts of continuous development on software, (2) to pinpoint various tools used to carry out this process, (3) to highlight the challenges faced in adopting continuous approaches for development and (4) to analyze the phases of continuous software engineering.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a novel end-to-end approach for automatic welding-robot programming based on a product-process-resource (PPR) model, for one-of-a-kind manufacturing systems. Traditionally, the information needed to program a welding robot is processed and transferred along the manufacturing organisation’s value chain by using several stand-alone digital systems which require extensive human input and high skill to operate. A PPR model is proposed through this research as a platform for storing and processing the necessary information along the value chain seamlessly. Unlike existing approaches which make use of complex algorithms to automatically identify the weldment seams, the approach suggested in this research makes use of information already digitalised by design engineers under the form of ISO 2553:2019 compliant weldment annotations. Hence, the PPR model contains the weldment annotations; it enables the automatic programming of welding robots and reduces human input down to a few minutes only. The applicability in manufacturing of the theoretical concept is demonstrated through technical implementations tested in the laboratory and on the value chain of an engineering-to-order (ETO) industrial partner involved in the metal fabrication industry. The experiments were conducted by creating several products using the proposed artefact. Experiments show that automatic programming of welding robots can be achieved using PPR models. The conducted experiments showed a reduction of about 80},

We propose a model which takes into account all these stylized features. We first state our model under the historical measure, then, after introducing a structure preserving change of measure, we provide a risk-neutral version of the same model and we show how to price geometric and arithmetic Asian options. To this end, we derive semi-closed formulas for the geometric Asian options price and develop a computationally efficient simulation scheme for the price process, allowing to price the arithmetic counterparts using control variate technique. Finally, we propose a simple econometric experiment to document presence of jump clusters in commodity prices and evaluate the performances of the proposed simulation scheme on some parameter sets calibrated on real data.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the statistical evidence for the use of ‘rough’ fractional processes with Hurst exponent 
$$H< 0.5$$
 H < 0.5 for modeling the volatility of financial assets, using a model-free approach. We introduce a non-parametric method for estimating the roughness of a function based on discrete sample, using the concept of normalized p -th variation along a sequence of partitions. Detailed numerical experiments based on sample paths of fractional Brownian motion and other fractional processes reveal good finite sample performance of our estimator for measuring the roughness of sample paths of stochastic processes. We then apply this method to estimate the roughness of realized volatility signals based on high-frequency observations. Detailed numerical experiments based on stochastic volatility models show that, even when the instantaneous volatility has diffusive dynamics with the same roughness as Brownian motion, the realized volatility exhibits rough behaviour corresponding to a Hurst exponent significantly smaller than 0.5. Comparison of roughness estimates for realized and instantaneous volatility in fractional volatility models with different values of Hurst exponent shows that, irrespective of the roughness of the spot volatility process, realized volatility always exhibits ‘rough’ behaviour with an apparent Hurst index 
$$\widehat{H}<0.5$$
 H ^ < 0.5 . These results suggest that the origin of the roughness observed in realized volatility time series lies in the estimation error rather than the volatility process itself.},

  abstract  = {Water molecules in Europa’s icy surface are split into hydrogen and oxygen by charged particle bombardment. NASA’s Juno spacecraft flew near Europa and constrained the production of oxygen in Europa’s surface ice, thus providing only a narrow range to support habitability in its subsurface ocean. Jupiter’s moon Europa has a predominantly water-ice surface that is modified by exposure to its space environment. Charged particles break molecular bonds in surface ice, thus dissociating the water to ultimately produce H_2 and O_2, which provides a potential oxygenation mechanism for Europa’s subsurface ocean. These species are understood to form Europa’s primary atmospheric constituents. Although remote observations provide important global constraints on Europa’s atmosphere, the molecular O_2 abundance has been inferred from atomic O emissions. Europa’s atmospheric composition had never been directly sampled and model-derived oxygen production estimates ranged over several orders of magnitude. Here, we report direct observations of H_2^+ and O_2^+ pickup ions from the dissociation of Europa’s water-ice surface and confirm these species are primary atmospheric constituents. In contrast to expectations, we find the H_2 neutral atmosphere is dominated by a non-thermal, escaping population. We find 12 ± 6 kg s^−1 (2.2 ± 1.2 × 10^26 s^−1) O_2 are produced within Europa’s surface, less than previously thought, with a narrower range to support habitability in Europa’s ocean. This process is found to be Europa’s dominant exogenic surface erosion mechanism over meteoroid bombardment.},

  abstract  = {Soil spatial variability is a common situation in marine geotechnical engineering, while most studies have primarily focused on evaluating the uniaxial vertical ( V ), horizontal ( H ), or moment ( M ) bearing capacity of foundations in spatially variable clay. Whereas the process of combined bearing capacity analysis by probe method is complex, resulting in low efficiency. As a result, the simplified modified swipe (SMS) method is proposed in this paper, which can represent the capacity in any direction of the load space accurately and takes just 6.5 times the duration of a single probe loading for a half-failure envelope. Based on the established three-dimensional random finite element models, the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by analyzing the combined bearing capacity of five kinds of foundations in spatially variable clay. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the spatial variability of the soil cause various failure envelopes, and the response of the combined bearing capacity is not identical in all directions. The VHM failure envelopes with different probabilities are given and could be found that the safety factors recommended by the guidelines are insufficiently conservative for structures susceptible to soil spatial variability. Finally, a strategy for applying different safety factors to both load directions is proposed, which could be helpful for the design of foundations in spatially variable clay.},

  abstract  = {Kernel fuzzy weighted local information c-means (KWFLICM) algorithm has good segmentation effect in segmenting noisy images, but it can not effectively segment images with low contrast or high noise. The improved algorithm of KWFLICM is a kernel possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering with local information (KWPFLICM), which has better anti-noise performance. However, this algorithm loses more details of original image when segmenting the image. In this paper, a kernel-based possibilistic fuzzy local information clustering algorithm based on quadratic polynomial is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of KWPFLICM algorithm. At the same time, the local membership information of neighborhood pixels is introduced as the penalty factor to update the local information, so as to further improve the robustness of the algorithm. By optimizing the objective function of modified possibilistic fuzzy local information clustering with quadratic surface centers, the formulas of fuzzy membership, possibilistic typicality, and the coefficients of quadratic polynomial center are derived theoretically, and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is strictly proved by Zangwill theorem and bordered Hessian matrix. Experimental results show that compared with existing state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering-related algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better segmentation performance and stronger anti-noise robustness, and can effectively suppress noise and retain details. It will have far-reaching significance for the development of robust fuzzy clustering segmentation theory.},

  abstract  = {The rising popularity of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) needs a dedicated effort to find new solutions to expand VoWiFi cell capacity. The main aim of this research is to enhance the VoWiFi cell capacity using aggregate MAC protocol data unit (A-MPDU) frame aggregation. In this regard, we developed a mathematical formula to estimate the number of VoWiFi users that can be allowed without compromising the quality-of-service (QoS) of existing VoWiFi calls over the Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) standards by considering Arbitration inter-frame spacing (AIFS), Compressed RTP (cRTP) and A-MPDU frame aggregation. In this work, we utilized AIFS to assess the channel state prior to transmit VoWiFi data from the sender user equipment (UE) to the receiver UE and Short Inter-frame Spacing (SIFS) to transmit Request To Send (RTS) / Clear To Send (CTS) and Acknowledgement (ACK) frames. Using our proposed model, we have examined VoWiFi cell capacity considering A-MPDU frame aggregation in constant bit rate (CBR) traffic using AIFS and DCF Inter-frame Spacing (DIFS) in IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac/ax/be Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standards. Additionally, we have found the maximum number of MAC protocol data unit (MPDU)s aggregated in a single A-MPDU for IEEE 802.11b/g/n/ac/ax/be. Further, we have analyzed the effect of voice packet retransmission on the cell capacity of a WLAN standard that provides VoWiFi service considering A-MPDU technique.},

  abstract  = {Als Reisende schätzen wir die Umweltfreundlichkeit der Bahn, und es ist uns wichtig, sicher und pünktlich an unser Ziel zu kommen. Dies ist jedoch nur möglich, wenn alle technischen Komponenten im Bahnsystem zuverlässig arbeiten und notwendige Inspektionen und Wartungen effizient geplant werden können. Mit dem Ausbau von Hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken und dem oft enger werdenden Fahrtakt steigen natürlich auch die materialspezifischen Anforderungen an sicherheitsrelevante Bahnkomponenten. Dies wiederum erfordert ein vertieftes Verständnis für die Funktionalität und Lebensdauer von Fahrzeug- und Infrastrukturkomponenten sowie den Einsatz moderner Werkstoffe, um den hohen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden. Der Forschungsbedarf im Bahnsektor ist also nach wie vor groß. Die Herausforderung für Bahnbetreiber besteht darin, noch schneller, komfortabler, pünktlicher und umweltfreundlicher zu werden und dabei trotzdem wirtschaftlich zu bleiben. Um die eingangs erwähnten Merkmale Sicherheit und Pünktlichkeit (Verfügbarkeit) in Einklang zu bringen und die Wirtschaftlichkeit durch möglichst lange Betriebszeiten zu erhöhen, muss der aktuelle Zustand sicherheitsrelevanter Bahnkomponenten bekannt sein. Aus diesem Grund werden diese Komponenten überwacht und die entsprechenden Messdaten erfasst und ausgewertet. Auf Basis solcher Zustandsüberwachungssysteme können maßgeschneiderte Instandhaltungsmaßnahmen rechtzeitig geplant und zu den bestmöglichen Terminen durchgeführt werden. Die eisenbahnbezogenen Forschungsaktivitäten am MCL befassen sich genau mit diesen Themen der Zustandsüberwachung und der darauf basierten Instandhaltung von Infrastruktur (Schienen und Weichen) und Radsätzen (Räder und Radsatzwellen). As train passengers, we value the environmental friendliness of the railroad, and it is important to us to arrive at our destination safely and on time. However, this is only possible if all technical components in the rail system work reliably and necessary inspection and maintenance can be planned efficiently. The expansion of high-speed tracks and the ever tighter travel cycles naturally also increase the material-specific requirements for safety-relevant railroad components. This in turn requires an in-depth understanding of the functionality and service life of rail vehicle and rail infrastructure components as well as the use of modern materials in order to meet the high demands. There is consequently still a great need for research in the rail sector. The challenge railroad operators are facing is to become even faster, more comfortable, more punctual, and more environmentally friendly, but to still remain economically viable. In order to reconcile the safety and punctuality (availability) characteristics initially mentioned and to increase the economic efficiency by means of extended maintenance intervals, the current status of safety-relevant railroad components must be known. This is why these components are monitored and the corresponding measurement data are logged and evaluated. Based on such condition monitoring systems, customized maintenance measures can be planned timely and carried out at the best possible time slots. Railway-related research activities at the MCL deal precisely with these topics of condition monitoring and the resulting maintenance of rail infrastructure (rails and switches) and railway wheelsets (wheels and wheelset axles).},

  abstract  = {In the digital age, as social media evolves into a new and significant centre for the dissemination of Chinese folk beliefs, the Malaysian Chinese have actively shared information about these folk beliefs on their social media platforms. The dissemination has transcended regional barriers, encouraging more Malaysian Chinese across various states to actively participate in public discussions on this topic. This study delves into Malaysian Chinese folk beliefs by analysing data from Facebook. A comprehensive examination of 4012 text posts was conducted using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for topic modelling. The analysis identified four main themes on social media: ‘Practitioners Worship’, ‘Temple Activities’, ‘Deity Legends’, and ‘Merchandise about Deity Statues’. Based on integrating social construction theory and media ecology theory, the study first explores the varied constructors, including practitioners, temple organisations, media organisations, and merchants. Secondly, Malaysian Chinese folk beliefs on social media present characteristics of utilitarianism, regional diversity, multiple social functions, flowing realms, strong Taoist elements, commercialisation, and a close relationship with the Spring Festival. Furthermore, ‘Safety and Peace’, ‘Pray for Demands’, and ‘Merits and Virtues’ form an interconnected semantic nexus. Hence, the findings theoretically highlight the interaction and significance of social media in the construction and practice of folk beliefs within the Malaysian Chinese community. Practically, this research provides valuable insights into the understanding and dissemination of Malaysian Chinese religious culture in the digital era.},

  abstract  = {Pierce’s disease (PD) is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa , which affects grapevines in the Americas. Currently, vineyards in continental Europe, the world’s largest producer of quality wine, have not yet been affected by PD. However, climate change may alter this situation. Here we incorporate the latest regional climate change projections into a climate-driven epidemiological model to assess the risk of PD epidemics in Europe for different levels of global warming. We found a significant increase in risk above 
$$+\,2\,^{\circ }\hbox {C}$$
 + 2 ∘ C in the main wine-producing regions of France, Italy and Portugal, in addition to a critical tipping point above 
$$+\,3\,^{\circ }\hbox {C}$$
 + 3 ∘ C for the possible spread of PD beyond the Mediterranean. The model identifies decreasing risk trends in Spain, as well as contrasting patterns across the continent with different velocities of risk change and epidemic growth rates. Although there is some uncertainty in model projections over time, spatial patterns of risk are consistent across different climate models. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the future of PD at multiple spatial scales (country, Protected Designation of Origin and vineyard), revealing where, why and when PD could become a new threat to the European wine industry.},

One promising strategy to control progression of MS is the inhibition of the enzyme Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is centrally involved in the activation of both B cells and myeloid cells, such as macrophages and microglia. The benefit of BTK inhibition by evobrutinib was shown as we observed reduced pro-inflammatory activation of microglia when treating chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or following the adoptive transfer of activated T cells. Additionally, in a model of toxic demyelination, evobrutinib-mediated BTK inhibition promoted the clearance of myelin debris by microglia, leading to an accelerated remyelination. These findings highlight that BTK inhibition has the potential to counteract underlying chronic progression of MS.},

  abstract  = {Improved imaging techniques are required to help advance our understanding of the complex role of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Here, the authors develop a high-throughput, highly multiplexed tissue visualisation workflow and demonstrate its utility by characterising the response of the TME to radiotherapy in preclinical models of glioblastoma. The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in determining response to treatment. This involves a series of interconnected changes in the cellular landscape, spatial organization, and extracellular matrix composition. However, assessing these alterations simultaneously is challenging from a spatial perspective, due to the limitations of current high-dimensional imaging techniques and the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity over large lesion areas. In this study, we introduce a spatial proteomic workflow termed Hyperplexed Immunofluorescence Imaging (HIFI) that overcomes these limitations. HIFI allows for the simultaneous analysis of > 45 markers in fragile tissue sections at high magnification, using a cost-effective high-throughput workflow. We integrate HIFI with machine learning feature detection, graph-based network analysis, and cluster-based neighborhood analysis to analyze the microenvironment response to radiation therapy in a preclinical model of glioblastoma, and compare this response to a mouse model of breast-to-brain metastasis. Here we show that glioblastomas undergo extensive spatial reorganization of immune cell populations and structural architecture in response to treatment, while brain metastases show no comparable reorganization. Our integrated spatial analyses reveal highly divergent responses to radiation therapy between brain tumor models, despite equivalent radiotherapy benefit.},

  abstract  = {There are many health risks associated with injection drug use (IDU). Identifying people who inject drugs early can reduce the likelihood of these issues arising. However, extracting information about any possible IDU from a person’s electronic health records can be difficult because the information is often in text-based general clinical notes rather than provided in a particular section of the record or as numerical data. Manually extracting information from these notes is time-consuming and inefficient. We used a computational method to train computer software to be able to extract IDU details. Potentially, this approach could be used by healthcare providers to more efficiently and accurately identify people who inject drugs, and therefore provide better advice and medical care. Background Injection drug use (IDU) can increase mortality and morbidity. Therefore, identifying IDU early and initiating harm reduction interventions can benefit individuals at risk. However, extracting IDU behaviors from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) is difficult because there is no other structured data available, such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, and IDU is most often documented in unstructured free-text clinical notes. Although natural language processing can efficiently extract this information from unstructured data, there are no validated tools. Methods To address this gap in clinical information, we design a question-answering (QA) framework to extract information on IDU from clinical notes for use in clinical operations. Our framework involves two main steps: (1) generating a gold-standard QA dataset and (2) developing and testing the QA model. We use 2323 clinical notes of 1145 patients curated from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse to construct the gold-standard dataset for developing and evaluating the QA model. We also demonstrate the QA model’s ability to extract IDU-related information from temporally out-of-distribution data. Results Here, we show that for a strict match between gold-standard and predicted answers, the QA model achieves a 51.65},

While existing theoretical investigations have provided valuable insights, the intricate and multifaceted nature of modern science hinders the implementation of empirical experiments. This study leverages advancements in Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to investigate the patterns and dynamic mechanisms of topic-transition among scientists. By constructing the knowledge space across 6 large-scale disciplines, we depict the trajectories of scientists’ topic transitions within this space, measuring the flow and distance of research regions across different sub-spaces. Our findings reveal a predominantly conservative pattern of topic transition at the individual level, with scientists primarily exploring local knowledge spaces. Furthermore, simulation modeling analysis identifies research intensity, driven by the concentration of scientists within a specific region, as the key facilitator of topic transition. Conversely, the knowledge distance between fields serves as a significant barrier to exploration. Notably, despite potential opportunities for breakthrough discoveries at the intersection of subfields, empirical evidence suggests that these opportunities do not exert a strong pull on scientists, leading them to favor familiar research areas. Our study provides valuable insights into the exploration dynamics of scientific knowledge production, highlighting the influence of individual cognition, social factors, and the intrinsic structure of the knowledge landscape itself. These findings offer a framework for understanding and potentially shaping the course of scientific progress.},

  abstract  = {Data-intensive applications aim at discovering valuable knowledge from large amounts of data coming from real-world sources. Typically, workflow languages are used to specify these applications, and their associated engines enable the execution of the specifications. However, as these applications become commonplace, new challenges arise. Existing workflow languages are normally platform-specific, which severely hinders their interoperability with other languages and execution engines. This also limits their reusability outside the platforms for which they were originally defined. Following the Design Science Research methodology, the paper presents SWEL (Scientific Workflow Execution Language). SWEL is a domain-specific modeling language for the specification of data-intensive workflows that follow the model-driven engineering principles, covering the high-level definition of tasks, information sources, platform requirements, and mappings to the target technologies. SWEL is platform-independent, enables collaboration among data scientists across multiple domains and facilitates interoperability. The evaluation results show that SWEL is suitable enough to represent the concepts and mechanisms of commonly used data-intensive workflows. Moreover, SWEL facilitates the development of related technologies such as editors, tools for exchanging knowledge assets between workflow management systems, and tools for collaborative workflow development.},

For the second approach, we extend the high-level code generator B2Program by JavaScript and integrate VisB visualizations alongside SimB simulations with timing, probabilistic and interactive elements. An important aspect of this work is to ease communication between modelers and domain experts. This is achieved by implementing features to run simulations, sharing animated traces with descriptions and giving feedback to each other.

In these settings, human behavior is essentially unconstrained as they can stray from the plan in numerous ways, constituting a critical source of uncertainty for the outcome of the robotic mission. Application designers require accessible and reliable frameworks to address this issue at an early development stage. We present a model-driven framework for developing interactive service robotic scenarios, allowing designers to model the interactive scenario, estimate its outcome, deploy the application, and smoothly reconfigure it. This article extends the framework compared to previous works by introducing an analysis of the impact of human errors on the mission’s outcome. The core of the framework is a formal model of the agents at play—the humans and the robots—and the robotic mission under analysis, which is subject to statistical model checking to estimate the mission’s outcome. The formal model incorporates a formalization of different human erroneous behaviors’ phenotypes, whose likelihood can be tuned while configuring the scenario. Through scenarios inspired by the healthcare setting, the evaluation highlights how different configurations of erroneous behavior impact the verification results and guide the designer toward the mission design that best suits their needs.},

  abstract  = {This empirical qualitative study explores the role of gaming simulations in catalyzing changes to organization-wide management’s perspectives on a novel strategy for aircraft orders and retirements. A large US airline developed the new strategy to tackle the pervasive problem of profit cyclicality, driving poor average profit performance across the cycle. Based on the dynamic model used to develop the strategy with senior management, a gaming simulation workshop was designed and delivered in groups of 20 to over 200 organization-wide managers. They tested various strategies for aircraft orders and retirements, under scenarios for market demand and conduct for competitors and regulators. A qualitative methodology was used to capture the workshop participants’ perspectives on the efficacy of various capacity strategies, before, during and after the workshop. The findings are that managers experiment risk-free with innovations in strategies for capacity orders and retirements and they do indeed discover for themselves that there are counterintuitive alternatives that can achieve large and stable profitable growth. These strategies depend on competitors (role-played by workshops participants in the simulation) cooperating to create a win-win equilibrium. Performance far exceeds the industry benchmark profit cycle. The contribution is the empirical evidence of the effectiveness of gaming simulations to catalyze managers’ shared beliefs and buy-in to a new strategy or business model. There are implications for practitioners in airlines and other sectors on the use of a gaming simulation workshop toolset, to help create such buy-in for an emerging strategy or business model. Protocols for best practice gaming simulation workshop design are discussed.},

This paper introduces a novel hybrid model, integrating fundamental and data-driven approaches, to enhance wear prediction of TBM disc cutters and enable accurate RUL estimation. The fundamental model is improved by incorporating composite wear mechanisms and load estimation techniques, showcasing superior prediction accuracy compared to single-mechanism models. Additionally, the hybrid model innovatively incorporates a data-driven supplementary residual term into the improved fundamental model, leading to a high-performance wear prediction model. Using actual field data from a highway tunnel project in Shenzhen, the performance of the hybrid model is rigorously tested and compared with pure fundamental and data-driven models. The hybrid model outperforms the other models, achieving the highest accuracy in predicting TBM disc cutter wear (mean absolute error ( MAE ) = 0.53, root mean square error ( RMSE ) = 0.64). Furthermore, this study thoroughly analyzes the hybrid model’s generalization capability, revealing significant impacts of geological conditions on prediction accuracy. The model’s generalization capability is also improved by expanding and updating the data sets. The RUL estimation results provided by the hybrid model are straightforward and effective, making it a valuable tool by which construction staff can monitor TBM disc cutters.},

  abstract  = {This paper aims at investigating the synchronization of unbalanced rotors and rigid frames in a vibration system, consisting of three elastically connected rigid frames and two counter-rotating unbalanced rotors, which are mounted on different inner rigid frames. Using the Lagrange approach, the governing equations of motions are derived. Using the method of averaging, the existence condition of synchronization for two unbalanced rotors is determined. Applying Lyapunov stability theory, the condition of the system to get stable synchronous states is obtained. In order to analyze the selected motion characteristic of unbalanced rotors and rigid frames, numerical simulations are performed. Specifically, the phase difference between two unbalanced rotors and motion lag phases of rigid frames is studied by considering different synchronous frequencies and ratios of masses of unbalanced rotors. Furthermore, a series of experiments for different frequency regions of vibrations is carried out to validate the obtained theoretical results. The coupling motion characteristics of unbalanced rotors are studied by comparing the cases of excitation of a single and two unbalanced rotors.

  abstract  = {Product customization in response to the widely varying perceptual expectations of different customers is an effective means to obtain customer satisfaction. Rapidly optimizing products to meet the personalized needs of different customers while controlling costs and improving design efficiency remains a challenge. In the present paper, a higher satisfaction product customization model was proposed with aim of efficiently reducing the number of target research customers and rapidly generating customer-oriented product design. In this model, a clustering algorithm based on emotional preference and migratory behavior (EPMC) was combined with a coupled model of interactive genetic algorithm with hesitancy-based interval individual fitness (IGA-HIIF) and Kansei Engineering (KE) method. This is the first implementation of EPMC in the customer research field, and the output content is optimized, which makes it capable of quickly dividing the multi-dimensional customer data space constructed in this study and accurately identifying different types of representative customers (RCs). And then, coupled the IGA-HIIF and KE model was adopted to establish a customer-oriented product evolution design system (PEDS). Finally, the most satisfactory products were auto-generated by PEDS with the participation of the RCs. The proposed method was applied to a case of social robot design. The result verifies that the approach could reduce the number of target research customers effectively without reducing diversity, allow direct customer involvement in the design process, and accurately extracts customers' personalized emotional implicit information and preference differences.},

  abstract  = {The loosening and fracture of the blade root bolt, a crucial link between the blade and hub, significantly affect the wind turbine's safe operation. To address this issue, the load redistribution after loosening and fracture of the blade root bolts is considered first. The theoretical model of axial force calculation of the blade root bolts is then deduced and verified through tests. Subsequently, a finite element model of the blade root bolt connection structure is established, and its effectiveness is analyzed. Finally, based on the finite element model, the effects of the preload force, the number of loosened or fractured, and the area of loosened or fractured on the loading characteristics of blade root bolts are investigated. Results show that when the preload force of the loosened blade root bolts is not zero, its axial stress variation law is the same as its preload force variation law. When the preload force is zero, the axial stress of the blade root bolts with zero preload force increases, whereas the axial stress of the non-loosened blade root bolts decreases. Exceeding the material's ultimate strength causes the blade root bolt to fracture. The axial stress in the loosened blade root bolts around the center of the fractured decreases, and the magnitude of the axial stresses of the surrounding non-loosened blade root bolts increases and then decreases along the fractured center to both sides. The findings can offer theoretical guidance for predicting the fatigue life of blade root bolts and their online monitoring.},

  abstract  = {Renewable energy sources were introduced as an alternative to fossil fuel sources to make electricity generation cleaner. However, today’s renewable energy markets face a number of limitations, such as inflexible pricing models and inaccurate consumption information. These limitations can be addressed with a decentralized marketplace architecture. Such architecture requires a mechanism to guarantee that all marketplace operations are executed according to predefined rules and regulations. One of the ways to establish such a mechanism is blockchain technology. This work defines a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy marketplace which addresses actors’ privacy and the performance of consensus mechanisms. The defined marketplace utilizes private permissioned Ethereum-based blockchain client Hyperledger Besu (HB) and its smart contracts to automate the P2P trade settlement process. Also, to make the marketplace compliant with energy trade regulations, it includes the regulator actor, which manages the issue and consumption of guarantees of origin and certifies the renewable energy sources used to generate traded electricity. Finally, the proposed marketplace incorporates privacy-preserving features, allowing it to generate private transactions and store them within a designated group of actors. Performance evaluation results of HB-based marketplace with three main consensus mechanisms for private networks, i.e., Clique, IBFT 2.0, and QBFT, demonstrate a lower throughput than another popular private permissioned blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric (HF). However, the lower throughput is a side effect of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant characteristics of HB’s consensus mechanisms, i.e., IBFT 2.0 and QBFT, which provide increased security compared to HF’s Crash Fault Tolerant consensus RAFT.},

  abstract  = {An orbitally ordered state in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8+ x is revealed, which splits the energy levels of oxygen orbitals by  50 meV. The primordial ingredient of cuprate superconductivity is the CuO_2 unit cell. Theories usually concentrate on the intra-atom Coulombic interactions dominating the 3 d ^9 and 3 d ^10 configurations of each copper ion. However, if Coulombic interactions also occur between electrons of the 2 p ^6 orbitals of each planar oxygen atom, spontaneous orbital ordering may split their energy levels. This long-predicted intra-unit-cell symmetry breaking should generate an orbitally ordered phase, for which the charge transfer energy ε separating the 2 p ^6 and 3 d ^10 orbitals is distinct for the two oxygen atoms. Here we introduce sublattice-resolved ε ( r ) imaging to CuO_2 studies and discover intra-unit-cell rotational symmetry breaking of ε ( r ). Spatially, this state is arranged in disordered Ising domains of orthogonally oriented orbital order bounded by dopant ions, and within whose domain walls low-energy electronic quadrupolar two-level systems occur. Overall, these data reveal a Q  = 0 orbitally ordered state that splits the oxygen energy levels by  50 meV, in underdoped CuO_2.},

  abstract  = {It is challenging to realize the gas saturation (GS) estimation via the integration of seismic data and more complementary data (e.g., elastic attributes) in a traditional physical framework. Machine learning, especially multi-task learning (MTL), provides an alternative way for the fuse of multiple information and simultaneous inversion of two or multiple reservoir parameters without model-driven limitations and interactive operators. To improve the estimation accuracy of GS, we propose the prestack simultaneous inversion of P-wave impedance (PI) and GS using the multi-task residual network (MT-ResNet). The designed MT-ResNet consists of two task-related subnets. The first subnet establishes the nonlinear links among low-frequency PI, prestack seismic data, and well-log derived PI. Furthermore, seismic data and the inverted PI via the first subnet are jointly entered into the second subnet and evolved into the well-log interpreted GS. A model based on measured petrophysical parameters associated with the field deep tight dolomite reservoir is used to test the proposed method. Tests on the synthetic data example and the field example demonstrate that the MT-ResNet can simultaneously estimate PI and GS models with the highest reliability, in comparison with single-task residual network (ST-ResNet) and the conventional seismic inversion and rock-physics equations-based method. And the MT-ResNet inverted PI can be utilized as complementary information for improving the prediction accuracy of MT-ResNet inverted GS. Our proposed MT-ResNet has the potential to guide the design of the MTL-based multiple reservoir parameters prediction and practical application.},

Specifically, a procedural component is only analyzed in those cases in which it might influence the satisfaction of the CTL requirement. We implemented our model-checking algorithms and evaluate them on randomized scalability benchmarks and on an interprocedural data-flow analysis of Java programs, showing both practical applicability and significant speedups in comparison to state-of-the-art model-checking tools for procedural programs.},

  abstract  = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising solution to enhance the spectral efficiency of sixth generation (6G) networks. NOMA enables multiple users to be concurrently served, relying on superposition coding at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. However, in practice, hardware impairments and channel estimation errors will lead to incorrect signal ordering. This study analyses inverse successive interference cancellation (ISIC) in downlink power-domain NOMA networks. In the worst case, ISIC will inversely order the N received signals, compared to conventional SIC. First, ISIC will decode the signal with the minimum allocated power, while treating the other 
$$N-1$$
 N - 1 signals as interference. This process is repeated 
$$N-1$$
 N - 1 times and in the last step, the signal with the maximum allocated power will be decoded without interference. Various key performance metrics for ISIC are analytically derived, including the outage probability, throughput, error probability, ergodic rate, achievable sum-rate, energy and spectral efficiency. In order to provide further insights on ISIC, an asymptotic analysis is also provided. Comparisons with SIC reveal that for the signal with the second-lowest power allocation level, ISIC achieves better performance, while the performance of the information signal with the minimum allocated power is degraded. Overall, our findings shed light on the performance of NOMA in practical settings where SIC can not be correctly performed and focuses on the worst-case where the decoding order at the receiver is completely inversed.},

  abstract  = {Multiple pathway models propose that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) arises from dysfunction in separate systems comprised of a "cool" or cognitive pathway versus a “hot” or emotional/reward pathway. Interactions between these pathways and the degree of maturation may further determine functional outcomes for adolescents ranging from those diagnosed with ADHD to typical development (TD). We used a latent profile analysis on rating scales and behavioral task performance assessing emotion, irritability, impulsivity, risk-taking, future orientation, and processing speed (PS) to identify subgroups of TD adolescents and adolescents with ADHD ( N  = 152) based on the hot and cool pathway model. We identified four classes: 1) High-Complex Challenges ; 2) Moderate-Mixed Challenges; 3) Non-Emotive Impulsivity ; and 4) High Regulation and Control. A multiple pathway model of ADHD is supported with classes differing in degree of emotional lability and irritability, types of impulsivity, and ability to use future consequences to modulate impulsivity and PS. The classes differed regarding functional behavior, with the High-Complex class demonstrating the most severe functional challenges in academic-related functioning. The Moderate-Mixed class also displayed significant functional challenges but with moderate emotional lability and irritability ratings. The Non-Emotive Impulsivity class exhibited low emotionality and low irritability, yet high impulsivity with limited negative functional consequences, and was composed of a mix of ADHD and TD adolescents. Differences between classes suggest ADHD symptomatology may represent both categorical and dimensional differences. Precision health interventions may be more effective in addressing the specific challenges associated with the classes rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to treating ADHD.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Based on analysis of the spread of new convergent SAR-CoV-2 strains, an original method for modeling scenarios for the spread of infection in the form of new COVID waves after the long-term activity minima has been proposed. Specific variants of the development of the current epidemic situation due to regularly updated strains have been modeled as versions of the pulsating epidemic process. The relevance of the development of a modeling technique with the inclusion of the virion binding indicator is related to the emergence of a series of convergent strains as a coronavirus evolutionary trend in 2025. It has been noted that the indicator of affinity of new strains fluctuates, which determines the COVID growth waves in several regions. The infection waves in the spring of 2024 were determined by the activity of the evolutionary branch of BA.2.86 strains, which had time to split and were successful in binding affinity and in avoiding antibodies. The JN lineage displaced the Omicron lines that dominated in 2023. The Pirоla branch strains were transmissible with reduced affinity for the ACE2 receptor and a lower replication rate. The advantage of the Pirоla coronavirus branch was the increased virus persistence time. In the fall of 2024, the virus evolution trend changed with an emphasis on the complication of the phylogenetic tree. The convergent XEC and XDC variants appeared which seemed dangerous. Unexpectedly, in the winter of 2025, the variants spread more slowly than predicted and turned out to be inefficient. In 2025, a selection of the Spike protein variants providing balanced characteristics for replication and evasion from antibodies occurs. The potential for variability of coronavirus proteins has not been exhausted. We have proposed a method for computational study of epidemic scenarios based on the modification of hybrid equations rebuilt on the basis of tracking the virion affinity and fusogenicity indicators. The decaying COVID wave models developed by the author on the basis of equations with the delay and threshold effects have been modified to take into account that fluctuations in the binding affinity of strains change the dynamics of COVID waves. The identified changes in the infection oscillation modes have been described within the model by the algorithmic rearrangement in the right-hand sides of the equations with damping functions. According to the available epidemic curves of COVID waves, the models require rearrangement of the regulation functions, which follows the evolutionary trend of convergent strains. It has been proposed to model aspects of the epidemic stage in 2025 using special computing tools. An original method for forming a structure for the hybrid model has been substantiated based on a set of the right-hand sides of differential equations with the heterogeneous parameters of delayed regulation that generate relaxation oscillations and are redefined when the truth criteria for predicates are violated. It has been shown that a change in the binding affinity of the S-protein variants with ACE2 is a key indicator for modeling the wave attenuation and activation periods associated with the virus evolution. The hybrid model describes event-driven transformations in the forms of epidemic waves that follow disturbances in the coronavirus mutational landscape, which is implemented by monitoring the mutations, frequency of occurrence of strains, their affinity, and fusogenicity. The LB.8 strain turned out to be not as aggressive in evolution in 2025 as expected.},

  abstract  = {A local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction, called non-reciprocal driving, is introduced, showing a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons and providing waveguiding and wave-processing possibilities for other fields. From protein motifs^ 1 to black holes^ 2 , topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields^ 3 . So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions^ 3 , 4 . Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators^ 5 – 8 subject to a bistable potential^ 9 – 14 . We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations—so-called non-Hermitian skin waves^ 5 – 8 , 15 – 22 , which are typically unstable—into robust one-way (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that shows the breaking of ‘supersymmetry’^ 23 , 24 causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion^ 25 and could emerge in other settings, for example, quantum mechanics^ 26 , 27 , optics^ 28 – 30 and soft matter^ 31 .},

  abstract  = {Understanding the biological functions of proteins is of fundamental importance in modern biology. To represent a function of proteins, Gene Ontology (GO), a controlled vocabulary, is frequently used, because it is easy to handle by computer programs avoiding open-ended text interpretation. Particularly, the majority of current protein function prediction methods rely on GO terms. However, the extensive list of GO terms that describe a protein function can pose challenges for biologists when it comes to interpretation. In response to this issue, we developed GO2Sum (Gene Ontology terms Summarizer), a model that takes a set of GO terms as input and generates a human-readable summary using the T5 large language model. GO2Sum was developed by fine-tuning T5 on GO term assignments and free-text function descriptions for UniProt entries, enabling it to recreate function descriptions by concatenating GO term descriptions. Our results demonstrated that GO2Sum significantly outperforms the original T5 model that was trained on the entire web corpus in generating Function, Subunit Structure, and Pathway paragraphs for UniProt entries.},

  abstract  = {This study aims to investigate the impact of digital capabilities on business model innovation, and emphasizes the pivotal mediating role of dynamic capabilities, comprising sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring resources, in translating digital strengths into innovative business models. And also uncovers a nuanced perspective on organizational inertia, showcasing its potential to positively moderate the relationship between digital capabilities and business model innovation. A questionnaire-based, time-lagged study with a 1-week interval. From January 2023 to March 2023, we collected a total of 262 questionnaires from entrepreneurs located in the Pearl River-West River Economic Belt, such as Guangzhou and Nanning, China. To analyse the moderation and mediation model, we utilized The PROCESS Model 5. Digital capabilities have a positive impact on the innovation of enterprises’ business models. Moreover, the connection between digital capabilities and business model innovation is mediated by dynamic capability. The findings also illustrate that organisational inertia moderates the relationship between digital capabilities and business model innovation. This study contributes to the existing literature on enterprise sustainable development by shedding light on the mediating and moderating mechanisms through which digital capabilities enhance business model innovation in enterprises. These findings offer valuable insights for enterprises aiming to thrive in dynamic markets, emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach to digital innovation, and instrumental for entrepreneurs seeking to refine their organisational strategies, particularly by bolstering their digital capabilities.},

This review discusses key in situ techniques and their applications in catalysis research. Advances in in situ electron microscopy allow direct visualization of catalysts at the atomic scale under reaction conditions. In situ spectroscopy techniques like X-ray absorption spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can track chemical states and reveal transient intermediates. Synchrotron-based techniques offer enhanced capabilities for in situ studies. The integration of in situ methods with machine learning and computational modeling provides a powerful approach to accelerate catalyst optimization.

  abstract  = {Recent studies have emphasized the connection between machine learning feature importance measures and total order sensitivity indices (total effects, henceforth). Feature correlations and the need to avoid unrestricted permutations make the estimation of these indices challenging. Additionally, there is no established theory or approach for non-Cartesian domains. We propose four alternative strategies for computing total effects that account for both dependent and constrained features. Our first approach involves a generalized winding stairs design combined with the Knothe-Rosenblatt transformation. This approach, while applicable to a wide family of input dependencies, becomes impractical when inputs are physically constrained. Our second approach is a U-statistic that combines the Jansen estimator with a weighting factor. The U-statistic framework allows the derivation of a central limit theorem for this estimator. However, this design is computationally intensive. Then, our third approach uses derangements to significantly reduce computational burden. We prove consistency and central limit theorems for these estimators as well. Our fourth approach is based on a nearest-neighbour intuition and it further reduces computational burden. We test these estimators through a series of increasingly complex computational experiments with features constrained on compact and connected domains (circle, simplex), non-compact and non-connected domains (Sierpinski gaskets), we provide comparisons with machine learning approaches and conclude with an application to a realistic simulator.},

  abstract  = {Unmanned swarm systems are now employed in a wide range of applications. Agriculture, commerce, and the military will all benefit from the advancement of unmanned swarm technology. Scenarios should have a standardized description and definition as system input to support numerous applications and accelerate scenario validation, allowing for more precise and specialized processing to standardize the validation process. A scenario description language for unmanned swarm (SL4U) is introduced in order to implement the unmanned swarm scenario. The scenario is divided into environment and task. The environment is defined, including the task space, target, and home locations, and the initial settings of the unmanned swarm. In terms of tasks, four categories of tasks, four temporal relationship constraints, the event handler, as well as other elements are identified. The dual engines of parsing and micro-embedded collaboration we developed will handle the SL4U. We employ a search and rescue scenario in both simulation and physics to test SL4U. Through the processing of the dual engines, the unmanned swarm’s search and rescue operations in a predefined environment are accomplished successfully. In more complex scenarios, just add more descriptions to SL4U and implement them in dual engines rather than starting from scratch. The use of SL4U in verification minimizes the cost and time consumption of unmanned swarm, particularly in physical verification.},

  abstract  = {Scientific discovery concerns finding patterns in data and creating insightful hypotheses that explain these patterns. Traditionally, each step of this process required human ingenuity. But the galloping development of computer chips and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) make it increasingly more feasible to automate some parts of scientific discovery. Understanding human planning is one of the fields in which AI has not yet been utilized. State-of-the-art methods for discovering new planning strategies still rely on manual data analysis. Data about the process of human planning is often used to group similar behaviors together. Researchers then use this data to formulate verbal descriptions of the strategies which might underlie those groups of behaviors. In this work, we leverage AI to automate these two steps of scientific discovery. We introduce a method for automatic discovery and description of human planning strategies from process-tracing data collected with the Mouselab-MDP paradigm. Our method utilizes a new algorithm, called Human-Interpret, that performs imitation learning to describe sequences of planning operations in terms of a procedural formula and then translates that formula to natural language. We test our method on a benchmark data set that researchers have previously scrutinized manually. We find that the descriptions of human planning strategies that we obtain automatically are about as understandable as human-generated descriptions. They also cover a substantial proportion of relevant types of human planning strategies that had been discovered manually. Our method saves scientists’ time and effort, as all the reasoning about human planning is done automatically. This might make it feasible to more rapidly scale up the search for yet undiscovered cognitive strategies that people use for planning and decision-making to many new decision environments, populations, tasks, and domains. Given these results, we believe that the presented work may accelerate scientific discovery in psychology, and due to its generality, extend to problems from other fields.},

This paper proposes a model-based approach for the design and development of usable and reliable socio-technical interactive systems.

  abstract  = {Microalgae are well-known photosynthetic microorganisms used as cell factories for the production of relevant biotechnological compounds. Despite the outstanding characteristics attributed to microalgae, their industrial-scale production still struggles with scale-up problems and economic feasibility. One important bottleneck is the lack of suitable online sensors for the reliable monitoring of biological parameters, mostly concentrations of intracellular components, in microalgae bioprocesses. Software sensors provide an approach to improving the monitoring of those process parameters that are difficult to quantify directly and are therefore only indirectly accessible. Their use aims to improve the productivity of microalgal bioprocesses through better monitoring, control and automation, according to the current demands of Industry 4.0. In this review, a description of the microalgae components of interest as candidates for monitoring in a cultivation, an overview of software sensors, some of the available approaches and tools, and the current state-of-the-art of the design and use of software sensors in microalgae cultivation are presented. The latter is grouped on the basis of measurement methods used as software sensor inputs, employing either optical or non-optical techniques, or a combination of both. Some examples of software sensor design using simulated process data are also given, grouped according to their design, either as model-driven or data-driven estimators.},

  abstract  = {Accurately forecasting short-term traffic flow is essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, current methods often struggle to fully exploit implicit variation patterns and heterogeneous correlations in traffic flow data, and can be sensitive to non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-immune and attention-based multi-modal model (NIAMNet) for short-term traffic flow forecasting. Inspired by the success of computer vision techniques, NIAMNet transforms one-dimensional traffic flow into images and embeds residual dual-attention blocks (RDB) to extract in-deep features. Besides, we introduce a dynamic noise-immune loss to address the impact of noise and outliers on model performance. Experimental results on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NIAMNet over existing methods, achieving the lowest MAPE (10.43, 9.79, 10.51, and 11.01) and RMSE (247.13, 192.36, 208.40, and 150.01). Additional ablation experiments are carried out to provide insight into the significance of each component.

  abstract  = {Mutation testing is an important technique able to evaluate the bug-detection effectiveness of existing software test suites. Mutation testing tools exist for several languages, e.g., Java and JavaScript, but no solutions are available for managing the mutation testing process for entire web applications, in the context of end-to-end (E2E) web testing. In this paper, we propose Mutta , a novel tool able to automate the entire mutation testing process. Mutta mutates the various server source files of the target web application, runs the E2E test suite against the mutated web applications, and finally collects the test outcomes. To evaluate Mutta , we designed a case study using the mutated versions of the target web application with the aim of comparing the effectiveness of two different approaches to E2E web testing: (1) test cases based on classical assertions and (2) test cases relying on differential testing. In detail, Mutta has been executed on two web applications, each equipped with different test suites to compare assertions with differential testing. In this scenario, Mutta generated a large number of mutants (more than 15k overall), took into account the coverage information to consider only the mutants actually executed, deployed the mutated web app, ran the entire E2E test suites (about 87k tests runs overall), and finally, it correctly saved the test suite results. Thus, results of the case study show that Mutta can be successfully employed to automate the entire mutation testing process of E2E web test suites and, therefore, can be used in practice to evaluate the effectiveness of different test suites (e.g., based on different techniques, E2E frameworks, or composed by a different number of test scripts).},

Three types of chatter mechanisms and their interrelationships in machining processes were introduced. To establish a comprehensive and accurate chatter stability model, the factors that primarily influence chatter stability were discussed from two perspectives: system structure and machining processes. The methods for identifying dynamic parameters of the machining system, including modal parameters and contact stiffness, were summarized. The principle, advantages, shortcomings, and applications of chatter stability region solution methods, including the stability lobe diagram (SLD ) methods, the frequency-domain methods, and the time-domain methods, were comprehensively analyzed. As the standard representation methods of stability analysis, SLD can be obtained based on control theory and machine learning techniques, respectively. The frequency-domain methods can be categorized into single-frequency methods and multi-frequency methods, while the time-domain methods encompass simulation time-domain methods and various discretization methods. In addition, the uncertainty analysis of the chatter stability was conducted for the first time, taking into account the uncertain parameters. The uncertainty analysis methods were outlined based on probability theory, interval number theory, and fuzzy set theory. On the above bases, the research challenges of the chatter stability in machining systems were summarized. Finally, its development trend has been prospected.},

  abstract  = {One of the crucial and challenging issues for researchers is presenting an appropriate approach to evaluate the aerodynamic characteristics of air cushion vehicles (ACVs) in terms of system design parameters. One of these issues includes introducing a suitable approach to analyze the effect of geometric shapes on the aerodynamic characteristics of ACVs. The main novelty of this paper lies in presenting an innovative method to study the geometric shape effect on air cushion lift force, which has not been investigated thus far. Moreover, this paper introduces a new approximate mathematical formula for calculating the air cushion lift force in terms of parameters, including the air gap, lateral gaps, air inlet velocity, and scaling factor for the first time. Thus, we calculate the aerodynamic lift force applied to nine different shapes of the air cushions used in the ACVs in the present paper through the ANSYS Fluent software. The geometrical shapes studied in this paper are rectangular, square, equilateral triangle, circular, elliptic shapes, and four other combined shapes, including circle-rectangle, circle-square, hexagonal, and fillet square. Results showed that the cushion with a circular pattern produces the highest lift force among other geometric shapes with the same conditions. The increase in the cushion lift force can be attributed to the fillet with a square shape and its increasing radius compared with the square shape.},

Envelope division and a new convex decomposition strategy with optimal gap metric are used to establish the switching polytopic LPV system of HVs. Sufficient conditions for stability assessment and controller synthesis for the switching polytopic LPV system are presented by average dwell time (ADT) and multiple parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions (MPDLF). To reduce computation burden and simplify the realization of controller, limited number of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived to dealing with switching polytopic LPV controllers by constructing the intermediate controller variables are depend affinely on the scheduling parameter.

  abstract  = {Widespread spatially coherent flood events can cause severe damage and disruption. Climate change has the potential to change the severity and frequency of such events. Despite this, assessment of future fluvial flood risk typically gives little to no consideration to potential changes in the spatial structure of future events. To understand the significance of this gap, climate model simulations are coupled with a national hydrological model to identify event spatially coherent present and future flood events. A statistical Empirical Copula is used to generate a large number of unseen events and linked to a national flood risk simulation model. The research finds that including changes in the spatial structure of flood events materially increases projected changes in risk when compared to conventional approaches based on local uplifts alone; increasing the projected change in Expected Annual Damage across Great Britain by a factor of   1.5. The event-based approach is also shown to provide new insights into the extreme distribution fluvial risk including single event damage, damage seasons, and damage years. The results suggest the 1-in-100-year winter flood may increase from £1.3b to £2.1b, and the 1-in-100 year single event damage may rise from £1.1b today to £1.7b by the 2080s given a 4 °C rise in Global Mean Surface Temperature (assuming current adaptation policies continue and no population growth). Consequently, the findings suggest a much greater emphasis is needed on spatial ‘flood events’ if future risk is to be understood and adaptation responses appropriately framed. Graphical abstract },

  abstract  = {蒸散发是地气系统水、 碳和能量循环的关键组成部分. 近年来估算区域尺度的蒸散发方法和蒸散发产品得到了极大发展, 但由于地面观测台站稀少且分布不均, 不同蒸散发产品的准确性和适用性仍需要系统验证和评估, 尤其是对于青藏高原这样的大地形区更是如此. 本研究将“亚洲水塔”——青藏高原作为研究区域, 评估了多源匹配方法在青藏高原上的适用性. 并在此基础上利用该方法量化了多源蒸散发产品(再分析产品、 遥感产品和陆面模型产品)的不确定性. 主要研究结论如下: 1)与陆面模式组(10.22   17.97 mm month^−1)和再分析组(7.27   12.26 mm month^−1)相比, 遥感组蒸散发产品的不确定性最低(5.95   7.06 mm month−1). 2)建立了一套2005–2015年青藏高原月尺度的融合蒸散发产品(MET). 通过青藏高原地区通量塔实测数据的验证结果表明, 融合产品的精度优于单一蒸散发产品. 3)基于该融合产品, 揭示了青藏高原的年蒸散发总量及其时空变化规律. 青藏高原全域的年蒸散发总量约为380.60 mm而青藏高原2005-2015年蒸散发的增加趋势为1.59±0.85 mm yr^−1. 本研究为未来青藏高原及其周边地区能量和水分循环研究及水资源管理研究打下了坚实的基础. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial variable in the terrestrial water, carbon, and energy cycles. At present, a large number of multisource ET products exist. Due to sparse observations, however, great challenges exist in the evaluation and integration of ET products in remote and complex areas such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this paper, the applicability of the multiple collocation (MC) method over the TP is evaluated for the first time, and the uncertainty of multisource ET products (based on reanalysis, remote sensing, and land surface models) is further analyzed, which provides a theoretical basis for ET data fusion. The results show that 1) ET uncertainties quantified via the MC method are lower in RS-based ET products (5.95 vs. 7.06 mm month^−1) than in LSM ET products (10.22 vs. 17.97 mm month^−1) and reanalysis ET estimates (7.27 vs. 12.26 mm month^−1). 2) A multisource evapotranspiration (MET) dataset is generated at a monthly temporal scale with a spatial resolution of 0.25° across the TP during 2005–15. MET has better performance than any individual product. 3) Based on the fusion product, the total ET amount over the TP and its patterns of spatiotemporal variability are clearly identified. The annual total ET over the entire TP is approximately 380.60 mm. Additionally, an increasing trend of 1.59±0.85 mm yr^−1 over the TP is shown during 2005–15. This study provides a basis for future studies on water and energy cycles and water resource management over the TP and surrounding regions.},

Case-specific solutions providing blended modeling, to a certain extent, for domain specific languages have been provided in the last few years. Nevertheless, a generic and language-agnostic full-fledged blended modeling framework has not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and generic blended modeling framework prototype that provides automated mechanism to generate graphical and textual notations from a given domain-specific modeling language. Moreover, it offers a flexible editor to get expert’s feedback on the mapping between graphical and textual notations. The proposed prototype is validated through a proof-of-concept on the Portable test and Stimulus Standard use-case. Our initial results indicate that the proposed framework is capable of being applied in different application scenarios and dealing with multiple domain-specific modeling standards.},

  abstract     = {There is no silver bullet for software verification: Different techniques have different strengths. Thus, it is imperative to combine the strengths of verification tools via combinations and cooperation. CoVeriTeam is a language and tool for on-demand composition of cooperative approaches. It provides a systematic and modular way to combine existing tools (without changing them) in order to leverage their full potential. The idea of cooperative verification is that different tools help each other to achieve the goal of correctly solving verification tasks. The language is based on verification artifacts (programs, specifications, witnesses) as basic objects and verification actors (verifiers, validators, testers) as basic operations. We define composition operators that make it possible to easily describe new compositions. Verification artifacts are the interface between the different verification actors. CoVeriTeam consists of a language for composition of verification actors, and its interpreter. As a result of viewing tools as components, we can now create powerful verification engines that are beyond the possibilities of single tools, avoiding to develop certain components repeatedly. We illustrate the abilities of CoVeriTeam on a few case studies. We expect that CoVeriTeam will help verification researchers and practitioners to easily experiment with new tools, and assist them in rapid prototyping of tool combinations.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of the global population, along with advancements in modern technology brings many benefits such as convenient living, but it also exacerbates the issue of waste management, a growing environmental concern. As the amount of solid waste increases, it places additional strain on the waste management system and infrastructure. Especially in some healthcare circumstances, trash bins overflow are mismanaged and hazardous waste spreads around the area. This can cause injury, illness or even death to people and animals that are exposed. Addressing the above challenges, this paper introduces a smart waste management system for urban environments, utilize technology to optimize garbage handling. Sensors inside trash bins relay data to a central processing unit, which then can be used to analyze for further important information. Additionally, the system also contains a web application to present collected data, assist managers and staff to monitor trash bin statuses by time, facilitating more informed decision-making. Overall, the SmartTM system allows data-driven collection scheduling, thus eliminating unnecessary trips to empty bins, and disposing of full-filled bins on time. It results in fuel savings, and ensures environmental cleanliness by preventing overflow of normal waste, solid waste or hazardous waste. Also, the novelty of the project is the absence of a GPS module, which makes the device more portable and minimizes power consumption. This paper assembled three different hardware prototypes, including investigation reports of battery lifetime and LoRa distance testing of the end node and a web application for data visualization.},

Vellvm provides a specification for a large, practical subset of LLVM IR in the Rocq Proof Assistant in the support of verified compilers and program transformations. Program transformations often rely on the subtle details, and as a result Vellvm’s semantics are quite comprehensive: for instance we provide a sophisticated low-level memory model to support low-level operations, such as casts between pointers and integers, and justify optimizations in their presence. Our approach implements the semantics via monadic interpreters , which rely on a coinductively-defined data structure called ITrees . Crucially, this methodology supports the extraction of an executable interpreter, proved to refine the specification. We use the reference interpreter to validate the accuracy of the formalization, employing random differential testing between Clang and Vellvm implemented in our own LLVM IR program generator (GenLLVM), as well as via state-of-the-art C compiler testing frameworks (CSmith and YARPGen). Such testing has found bugs in both the Vellvm semantics and Clang. We believe that tools from the Vellvm project can be useful for other LLVM IR-related projects, and that the overall methodology applies to other formal verification efforts.},
